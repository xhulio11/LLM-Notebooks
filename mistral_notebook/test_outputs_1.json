    " Title: Poll Reveals Discrepancy Between Sanders Supporters' Desires for Free Services and Willingness to Pay for Them\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll conducted by Vox and Morning Consult, it was found that supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, known for his progressive policies, have strong support for initiatives like free college tuition and universal health care. However, the poll also revealed a significant discrepancy between their support for these initiatives and their willingness to pay for them.\n\nThe poll found that about 66 percent of Sanders supporters said they would not be willing to pay more than an additional $1,000 in taxes for universal health care. This includes the 8 percent of Sanders supporters who are not willing to pay anything at all. When asked what percentage of their income they would pay, voters seemed to be a bit more generous. While half of Sanders supporters said they are not willing to pay or that they would only pay less than 5 percent of their income, a quarter said they would pay between 5 and 10 percent.\n\nSanders supporters are far and away the most likely to want free public college tuition. However, 14 percent said they do not want to pay additional taxes for it, and another half said they would only pay up to $1,000 a year.\n\nSanders' plan would put an additional $5,000 of federal tax liability on households earning $50,000, but in exchange, he would nationalize vital services currently in the private sector. However, the majority of Sanders supporters in the poll (much less all voters) are not willing to pay enough to actually support those nationalized services.\n\nThe poll results undercut one of the main points pushed by Sanders on the campaign trail, which is that he is at the head of a political revolution that seeks to make America fairer by destroying the job-creating and investing class and usurping a corrupt campaign finance system that Democrats have used to win back-to-back presidential elections. The poll data shows his most ardent backers do not want to pay for anything he's promising; they just want it.\n\nMoreover, it's hard to say this is the vestige of a left-wing swell in American politics when you can't win in the South. It's not a revolution, then\u2013it's just some senior citizens saying what young, college-educated whites want to hear. Sanders' base is primarily young, college-educated whites, which is not earth-shattering, especially when you consider that Democrats have been losing the white vote nationally since the 1960s.\n\nThe poll results suggest that while Sanders supporters want a lot of government-provided services, they are not willing to pay for them, which could pose a challenge for Sanders' campaign if he is to implement his proposed policies.",
    " Title: Film Director Dinesh D'Souza Indicted for Alleged Campaign Finance Violations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza, known for his politically charged documentaries, was indicted Thursday on charges of violating federal campaign laws. The indictment, which was announced by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, states that D'Souza will appear in U.S. District Court in New York on Friday.\n\nAccording to the indictment, D'Souza, 52, is charged with one count of illegally donating to a Senate campaign and one count of causing false statements to be made to authorities in connection with the contributions. The donation in question was made to Republican Wendy Long, who lost a 2012 Senate bid against New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.\n\nThe indictment alleges that D'Souza directed various donors to give contributions to Long's campaign totaling $20,000, and then reimbursed them. Individuals are only allowed to donate a maximum of $5,000 to a candidate per election cycle.\n\nGerald Molen, D'Souza's co-producer on the film \"2016: Obama's America,\" told FoxNews.com that he believes D'Souza is being singled out by federal authorities. The 2012 film, which examined President Obama's past and early influences that may have shaped his political ideology, was a surprise hit, making over $33 million at the box office.\n\nMolen, who won an Oscar as a co-producer for \"Schindler's List,\" said the charges against D'Souza deeply disappoint him, as D'Souza is a \"great American.\" The indictment states the alleged illegal contributions came to light during the FBI's routine examination of campaign contributions filed with the FEC during the 2012 election year.\n\nD'Souza faces a maximum of two years in prison for the illegal contributions charge and a maximum of five years in prison for the false statements charge. The duo is teaming up again for a new film \"America,\" which Molen said will be released on schedule in July 2014 regardless of what happens in the case.\n\nMolen called on the American public to support the film's release, stating, \"Neither the filmmakers nor the American public can allow this prosecution to deter us from the film's release.\" He added, \"I look forward to my good friend Dinesh being vindicated for what appears to be nothing more than a misunderstanding.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Legal Troubles Deepen as Mueller Investigation Intensifies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a week marked by political upheaval and legal maneuvers, President Donald Trump has found himself in the midst of a deepening investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Despite the President's attempts to spin alternative narratives and dismiss the Russia probe, the growing body of evidence against him and his associates is raising new questions about potential collusion and obstruction of justice.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump announced the departure of his chief of staff, John Kelly, and took to Twitter to denounce the ongoing investigation as a \"witch hunt\" and a \"collusion illusion.\" The President's tweets came in response to a series of legal filings and court actions this week that have significantly sharpened the threats facing Trump and key associates.\n\nThe filings and court actions suggest that Mueller's investigation has expanded beyond the 2016 campaign and is now delving into possible obstruction of justice following the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. This was underscored by reports that Mueller has spoken to Kelly in recent months, a development that is particularly significant given that Kelly did not take up his post until July 2017.\n\nThe filings also revealed that Trump directed his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to make payments to women who claimed affairs with Trump, a move that allegedly violated campaign finance laws. Furthermore, Mueller has linked Trump's business interests to the Russian election meddling effort, pointing out that work on a proposed Trump Tower Moscow project continued until deep into the campaign in June 2016, a fact that Cohen had previously lied about.\n\nTrump and his legal team maintain that the President is in the clear, with his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, stating that \"there's nothing that links the President to collusion with the Russians.\" However, the depth of the President's legal and political difficulties will only become clear when Mueller files a final report, and Trump's team will have the opportunity to challenge his findings and make their defense.\n\nMeanwhile, the President has been embroiled in a Twitter spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, taunting him over the ongoing protests in France. This diversionary tactic, while potentially pleasing to Trump's base, does little to change the reality of the widening special counsel probe.\n\nAs the investigation continues, it remains to be seen how the President and his associates will navigate the increasingly complex web of allegations and evidence. One thing is certain, however: the special counsel's accelerating pace is proving to be a formidable challenge to Trump's talent for creating alternative realities.",
    " Title: Trump Frustrated Over Sessions Recusal, Staff Performance, and Overshadowed Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - President Donald Trump is reportedly frustrated with his senior staff and communications team for allowing the controversy surrounding Attorney General Jeff Sessions to overshadow his address to Congress. Sources tell CNN that Trump is particularly upset with the communications team for not being prepared when the Sessions story broke.\n\nOn Thursday, Sessions recused himself from any current or future investigations into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign after it was reported he had met with the Russian ambassador to the US, something he had previously failed to disclose. This renewed focus on Russia is seen as a major letdown after Tuesday when top officials were riding high, congratulating one another on Trump's speech to Congress.\n\nThe President was reportedly \"hot\" and exasperated Thursday night after Sessions' recusal, a source familiar with the situation said, considering it hasty and overkill. When Trump returned to the White House Thursday evening from a day trip to Virginia, there were \"a lot of expletives,\" the source said, adding that for more than a week Trump had been lamenting that his senior staff \"just keep getting in their own way.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer responded to CNN's reporting, saying, \"The President is showing increasing flashes of anger over the performance of his senior staff and daily developments about Russia overshadowing his message. The President is upset because he doesn't believe he is getting the credit he thinks he deserves for his time in office so far because of self-inflicted wounds and missteps.\"\n\nTrump voiced his frustration to his inner circle in the Oval Office Friday, sources said. He feels attacked by the media, former Obama administration officials, and others, and frustrated that things are not going more smoothly. The President expressed his anger at non-stop leaks undermining his administration, the sources said.\n\nOne source familiar with the Friday meeting said Trump was angry at senior staff, including Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, about the state of affairs at the White House this week. Word had spread through the White House that Priebus had been chewed out, but those in the room dispute that. Priebus declined to comment on the record about the meeting.\n\nWith so much on the administration's plate - leaks, the Russia story, pending executive order, and Obamacare repeal and replacement - Priebus said he would not go to Florida with the President this weekend as had been previously planned, a source told CNN. He was on the manifest, and a big donor reception by the Republican National Committee which Priebus used to chair was on Preibus' schedule.\n\nBut the President said he thought it would not be a good idea since he is not happy with the state of matters right now, the same source said. A White House official disputed that Priebus was supposed to travel to Florida, adding that he stayed home this weekend for a family celebration.\n\nWhite House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, who initially decided to also stay in Washington Friday, ended up traveling to Florida Saturday and is joining Trump, Sessions, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross at dinner at Mar-a-Lago.",
    " Title: Conservative Defenses of Chris Christie's Bridge Scandal: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the George Washington Bridge scandal, leading conservative figures have taken a unique approach in defending former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Instead of focusing on the details of the scandal itself, they have compared the attention given to the bridge closure to other controversies during the Obama administration, such as Benghazi and the IRS scrutiny of political nonprofits.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, political strategist Karl Rove questioned the lack of attention from the Clinton camp on the bridge scandal, contrasting it with the extensive coverage of Benghazi and the IRS. He suggested that it would be challenging for Democrats to turn the bridge scandal into an issue due to the significant attention given to Christie.\n\nFormer New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani made a similar argument on ABC's \"This Week,\" stating that administrative mistakes occur, and during campaign mode, attention may be diverted. He compared the bridge scandal to the handling of the Benghazi incident during President Obama's term.\n\nHowever, the comparison between the George Washington Bridge scandal and the \"Obama scandals\" has been criticized as an inherently dishonest tactic. The \"Obama scandals\" have been widely regarded as politically motivated and lacking in substance, while the bridge scandal has provided substantial evidence of malfeasance.\n\nCritics argue that for the conservative meta-argument to hold up, the Obama administration's alleged scandals would have to be real. However, they are not real, making the comparison disingenuous.\n\nThe strategy of deflecting attention from the bridge scandal by attacking the media and implying that Democrats would have handled the situation less responsibly is unlikely to be effective. It is more likely to raise suspicions and further fuel the narrative that the conservative defense is motivated by political gain rather than a genuine concern for accountability.\n\nMoreover, the bridge scandal is still unfolding, and new details continue to emerge. If the scandal worsens for Christie, the \"What about Benghazi?\" and other off-topic retorts are likely to fall on deaf ears.\n\nIn conclusion, while the George Washington Bridge scandal has provided substantial evidence of malfeasance, conservative efforts to deflect attention from the issue by comparing it to politically motivated controversies during the Obama administration may not be successful. The strategy is seen as disingenuous and is unlikely to be persuasive, especially as the bridge scandal continues to unfold.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Acknowledges 'In-artful' Remark on Financial Status, Maintains Accuracy\n\nIn an interview with Fusion TV's Jorge Ramos, published Monday night, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted that her comment about being \"dead broke\" when she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, left the White House in 2001 was \"in-artful.\" However, she maintained the statement's accuracy.\n\nWhen asked, \"Do you regret telling Diana Sawyer that you were once 'dead broke'?\", Clinton responded, \"Well, I regret it. It was in-artful.\" She continued, \"It was accurate \u2014 but we are so successful and we're so blessed by the success we've had and my husband has worked incredibly hard.\"\n\nClinton then shifted the conversation towards her concern for working families, stating, \"What I worry about is not my family. I worry about other families in our country who feel like they\u2019re running in place, they\u2019re not getting ahead or maybe they're falling backwards. What I want to do \u2014 and this is what Bill has always done since the very beginning of his public life \u2014 is to try to create more ladders of opportunity for more Americans so that they can have the same opportunities that Bill and I have had.\"\n\nRamos persisted with his line of questioning, asking, \"Do you know your net worth? Do you know how much money you have?\" Clinton responded, \"Um, you know, within a range,\" before mentioning their two homes. When pressed about the value of their wealth, Clinton acknowledged, \"Yes, indeed.\"\n\nAccording to CNN, former President Bill Clinton earned $106 million between 2001 and early 2013. Hillary Clinton has reportedly earned an estimated $12 million since leaving the State Department in 2013. In a June 9 interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer, Clinton stated, \"We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt.\"",
    " Title: Trump Plans Rebuttal to Clinton's Foreign Policy Criticism, Defends Iraq War Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to counter Hillary Clinton's harsh criticism of his foreign policy, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has announced plans to deliver a rebuttal as early as Monday. Trump made the announcement during an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday.\n\n\"I think I'm going to devote a retort to her speech. Maybe I'll do it on Monday, before the election\" in California and four other states, Trump said.\n\nTrump mocked Clinton for working with speechwriters on her San Diego remarks and dismissed her characterization of him as \"temperamentally unfit\" for the presidency and driven by personal feuds, insisting he has \"very strong, very thick skin.\"\n\n\"Most of the things, many of the things she said, are wrong,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Republican nominee also defended his claims that he opposed the Iraq War before it began. \"I was against it from before it started,\" he said. However, it's clear Trump opposed the war by 2004, but there's not yet any public evidence that he opposed it before the war began in 2003. In a 2002 interview with Howard Stern, Trump said, \"Yeah, I guess so\" when asked whether he supported then-President George W. Bush's push to go to war.\n\nTrump cast his comments in that 2002 interview as wishy-washy, saying they show he was moving toward opposing the war. \"That interview was substantially before the war started,\" Trump said. \"First time I was ever asked the question.\"\n\nIn a separate interview on \"State of the Union,\" Clinton criticized Trump over his Iraq War claim. \"Well, he supported it,\" the Democratic front-runner said. \"We have evidence and audio of him supporting it, so I think that's another example of him trying to rewrite history.\"\n\nTrump also criticized protesters who have been involved in violent clashes outside his campaign events, calling them \"thugs\" planted by Democrats. \"They're thugs,\" he told Tapper. \"The people that are outside -- they're thugs and they're agitators. They're bad people. I think they're sent by the Democrats.\"\n\nAsked for evidence to back his claim that the protesters are being sent by Democrats, Trump said, \"Well, they have Bernie signs.\" Anti-Trump protesters clashed with his supporters outside a rally last week in San Jose. Previously, protesters had thrown rocks and bottles and burned signs in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and protesters and Trump supporters fought in Chicago at an event Trump ultimately canceled.\n\nTrump said police should be \"very strong\" with protesters at his events -- but said he's not criticizing police for how they've handled the protests so far. \"I think the police forces are being treated very unfairly in this country. They're afraid to do anything because they don't want to lose their jobs, they don't want to lose their pension, they don't want to be criticized,\" he said.\n\nTrump also vociferously defended his claims that a judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University is biased because of his Mexican heritage -- pushing back against criticism that his objections are racist. The presumptive GOP nominee told Tapper that U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, a federal district judge in the Southern District of California, has made \"rulings that people can't even believe.\"\n\n\"He's proud of his his heritage. I respect him for that,\" Trump said, dismissing charges that his allegation was racist. \"He's a Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico.\" Trump first broached these waters in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Thursday, in which he said Curiel, who was born in Indiana, had an \"inherent conflict of interest\" in the Trump University lawsuit.\n\n\"If he was giving me a fair ruling, I wouldn't say that,\" Trump told Tapper, pointing again to Curiel's background. \"I think that's why he's doing it.\" \"I'm building a wall. I'm trying to keep business out of Mexico. Mexico's fine,\" Trump continued. \"He's of Mexican heritage, and he's very proud of it.\"",
    " Title: Missouri State Trooper Condemns Violent Agitators Amidst Ongoing Ferguson Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a night of unrest in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson addressed the media early Tuesday, condemning \"violent agitators\" who he claimed were using largely peaceful protests as a cover for criminal activities.\n\nJohnson reported that 31 individuals had been arrested during the night, following a day of largely peaceful protests that ensued after the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by a white police officer on August 9. As Johnson spoke, two handguns and a Molotov cocktail, confiscated during the night by authorities, lay on a table in front of him.\n\nThe majority-black town of approximately 21,000 has been in turmoil since Brown's death. Local authorities have frequently used tear gas and smoke canisters against protesters who have been expressing their discontent with the response to the shootings by Ferguson Police.\n\nJohnson stated that officers had come under heavy gunfire from protesters, and at least two individuals had been shot. He did not provide information on the condition of the shooting victims. Four officers had been injured when struck by rocks or bottles, though Johnson asserted that police had not fired a single shot.\n\nCiting a \"dangerous dynamic in the night,\" Johnson requested that protests take place during daylight hours, allowing officers to effectively isolate any troublemakers. However, Johnson acknowledged that his forces could not make protesters leave the streets after sunset if they did not wish to do so.\n\n\"This nation is watching each and every one of us,\" said Johnson. \"I am not going to let the criminals that have come here from across this country, or live in this neighborhood, define this community.\" Johnson added that some of those arrested overnight had traveled from as far as New York and California. The trooper also directed his criticism towards the assembled media, stating they had put themselves and officers in danger by failing to clear areas when asked, and urged them not to \"glamorize the acts of criminals.\"\n\n\"We do not want to lose another life in this community,\" Johnson added.\n\nShortly before midnight local time, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that police had fired tear gas at a group of protesters who had reportedly defied orders to leave the parking lot of a burned-QuikTrip convenience store that has been near the center of demonstrations over the past eight days. St. Louis County Police Chief Sam Dotson told reporters that shots had been fired in the area, and media members were told to go to a designated area about a quarter of a mile away.\n\nLate Monday, reporters estimated that the number of protesters had dropped to around 100, far fewer than the number of media members who were covering them. A photographer for the Getty photo agency was arrested while covering the demonstrations and later released. Two German reporters were arrested and detained for three hours. Conservative German daily Die Welt said correspondent Ansgar Graw and reporter Frank Herrmann, who write for German regional papers, were arrested after allegedly failing to follow police instructions to vacate an empty street. They claimed they followed police orders.\n\nAt his news conference, Johnson stated in some cases it was not immediately clear who was a reporter, but that once it was established, police acted properly.\n\nAs darkness fell, National Guard units with armored vehicles were waiting at a staging area about a half-mile from the portion of West Florissant Avenue that has been the scene of the largest protests. Closer to the protest site, a crowd of demonstrators was marching and growing in size. Sheriff's deputies in body armor and state troopers carrying wooden bats and gas masks stood watch over the group.\n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that some protesters began throwing bottles at police shortly after 10 p.m. local time. Authorities responded by ordering protesters to clear the streets and firing high-pitched sound cannons.\n\nAnother group of protesters marched toward the police lines and stopped, defying orders that demonstrators could not assemble in a single spot, but had to keep moving instead. The Post-Dispatch reported that an armored vehicle moved down the street trying to clear the crowd, and a group of pastors locked arms and helped to move protesters away from the police line.\n\nIn federal court earlier Monday, a judge denied a request from the American Civil Liberties Union for a restraining order that would have prevented authorities from enforcing the no-stopping rule.\n\nA grand jury could begin hearing evidence Wednesday to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown's death, said Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney.\n\nThe St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy found that Brown was shot six to eight times in the head and chest, office administrator Suzanne McCune said Monday. However, she declined further comment, stating that the full findings were not expected for about two weeks.\n\nLawyers for Brown's family and hired pathologists stated that an independent autopsy determined that Brown was shot six times, including twice in the head.\n\nForensic pathologist Shawn Parcells, who assisted former New York City chief medical examiner Dr. Michael Baden during the private autopsy, said a bullet grazed Brown's right arm. He said the wound indicates Brown may have had his back to the shooter, or he could have been facing the shooter with his hands above his head or in a defensive position across his chest or face.\n\n\"We don't know,\" Parcells said. \"We still have to look at the other (elements) of this investigation before we start piecing things together.\"\n\nA third and final autopsy was performed Monday for the Justice Department by one of the military's most experienced medical examiners, Attorney General Eric Holder said. Holder was scheduled to travel to Ferguson later this week to meet with FBI and other officials carrying out an independent federal investigation into Brown's death.\n\nDue to the unrest, the Ferguson-Florissant School District announced late Monday that classes would be canceled for the remainder of the week. Students were due to return from summer vacation last week, but were held out due to the unrest.",
    " Title: Trump Slams RNC, Accuses Party of Running a \"Scam\" and \"Disgrace\" in Presidential Nominating Process\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has criticized the Republican National Committee (RNC) and its chairman, Reince Priebus, over the party's presidential nominating process, claiming it is a \"scam\" and a \"disgrace.\"\n\nDuring an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 at Trump Tower, Trump said, \"It's a disgrace for the party. And Reince Priebus should be ashamed of himself. He should be ashamed of himself because he knows what's going on.\"\n\nTrump is particularly upset with the way Colorado awarded all of its 34 delegates to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) without holding a primary or a caucus. He disagrees with the fact that some delegates are not bound to vote for their state or district winner at this summer's GOP convention in Cleveland.\n\n\"It should go to a vote in Colorado like other places.... The best way to do it would be just a vote, should be a vote of the people. That's the way it should be done. The delegate situation is a very unjust way of doing things,\" Trump said.\n\nAsked if he would call for Priebus to step down should he become the nominee, Trump responded, \"I have not given that any thought.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement, Sean Spicer, the RNC's chief strategist and communications director, said, \"Each state and territory submitted a plan on how to allocate and select their delegates last year. Those plans were made available to every campaign. Understanding the delegate selection and allocation is a basic part of the campaign.\"\n\nTrump floated a possible lawsuit after winning Louisiana, stating the party did not give him enough delegates. His campaign later downplayed the legal threat.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump aide Paul Manafort accused the Cruz campaign of not playing by the rules in its attempt to woo delegates. On NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Manafort said the Trump campaign will \"file several protests\" to the RNC.\n\nPriebus on Monday defended the RNC nominating system, saying the rules have not changed and there's \"nothing mysterious\" about what Colorado Republicans did. Last summer, the Colorado GOP opted to select unbound delegates to the Republican convention.\n\nIt is extraordinary for the Republican presidential front-runner and the head of the RNC to be at odds, especially less than 100 days before the convention begins. Last year, after Trump threatened to run as a third-party candidate, Priebus convinced the celebrity businessman and other GOP rivals to sign a pledge backing the party nominee. And earlier this month, Trump and Priebus met privately at the RNC headquarters on Capitol Hill. In a tweet, Trump said it was \"a very nice meeting,\" adding he was \"looking forward to bringing the party together.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump's tone was sharply different: \"I would have won Colorado. It's not democracy.... It's such a sad thing that the Republican Party has come to this.\"\n\nHe added, \"The Republican system is unfair, unjust, and they should create a fair system based on votes\u2014not a system like they have now that is based on politics as usual.\"\n\nAsked whether he's talked to Priebus, Trump shrugged his shoulders and said, \"Whatever happens, happens. I think the Republicans are being embarrassed. The whole country is talking about the scam that is going on, and it's politics. I mean, basically, the politicians put this in so that they can pick whoever they want, but I think we're going to have a big surprise for them.\"\n\nTrump said he sees similarities on the other side of the aisle, saying the Democratic National Committee is favoring Hillary Clinton over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\n\"I tell you, it's unfair even from the Democrats' side. Every time I turn on the television, Bernie wins, Bernie wins\u2014for weeks\u2014Bernie wins, Bernie wins, Bernie wins. And then I watch the commentators and they say, 'Bernie can't win.' How do you win every single week, every single state, and you can't win? You know why? Because it's a corrupt system. It's corrupt there, and it's more corrupt on the Republican side,\" he said.\n\nMore of \u2588\u2588\u2588's interview with Trump will run Wednesday morning.",
    " Title: Senate Confirmation Hearing for Brett Kavanaugh Marred by Last-Minute Document Release\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday was marked by a contentious start due to the late release of 42,000 pages of documents related to Kavanaugh's time in the George W. Bush White House. The documents were released the night before the hearing, leaving senators with little time to review them before the proceedings.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) criticized the timing, stating on Twitter, \"Not a single senator will be able to review these records before tomorrow.\" He added that the Trump White House has been the \"least transparent\" in history.\n\nThe late release of documents led to a heated exchange between Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and several Democratic senators, including Kamala Harris (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). These senators objected to the sudden influx of documents and called for the hearing to be postponed.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) questioned the timing, asking Grassley, \"What is the rush? What are they trying to hide?\"\n\nDuring the Democrats' protest, a group of protesters in the chamber chanted about \"obstruction of justice.\"\n\nIn response to the Democrats' objections, Grassley defended the committee's handling of the documents, stating that they had already reviewed 483,000 pages of Kavanaugh's executive branch service. He emphasized that this was more pages than the last five Supreme Court nominees combined and more materials than any Supreme Court nominee in history.\n\nThe timing of the document release was not only criticized by Democrats but also by some Republicans, such as Judge Andrew Napolitano on Fox News, who called the White House's release of documents \"exquisitely unfair\" due to the limited time it gave Democrats to sift through the information and prepare their questions.",
    " Title: Pro-Gun Advocates Remain Silent Following Connecticut School Shooting as Gun Control Debate Intensifies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, pro-gun organizations and politicians have largely remained silent, ceding their role in the ongoing national debate on gun control. The shooting, which resulted in the deaths of 20 first-graders and six school staff members, has sparked renewed calls for stricter gun laws and a re-evaluation of America's long-standing affinity for firearms.\n\nOn Friday, a 20-year-old resident of Newtown, Adam Lanza, took a high-powered rifle from his mother's collection, killed her, and then drove to the school. Once there, Mr. Lanza, a socially awkward individual described as being on the autism spectrum, forced his way into the school and, without uttering a word, killed the children and staff attempting to shield them.\n\nConservative radio host Rush Limbaugh criticized gun control proponents as early as Friday for attempting to exploit the tragedy for political gain, a tactic that struck an awkward note in a country where even pro-gun rights Americans paused to consider the implications of America's long-running affinity for guns.\n\nWhen David Gregory, host of NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d sent out 31 invitations to pro-gun Senators in the new Congress to discuss the issue on Sunday, no takers emerged. The Shooting Sports Foundation, a pro-gun rights group headquartered just a few miles from where the shootings took place, also remained silent, as did the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\nIn the absence of pro-gun rights voices, some conservative bloggers reminded readers of several instances in recent years when legal gun carriers thwarted potential mass shootings. In Portland, Oregon, one concealed weapons owner claims he brandished his gun after alleged mall shooter Jacob Roberts opened fire. According to the man, Roberts, whose rifle was jamming, fled the scene after seeing the gun and minutes later shot himself.\n\nEven on the blog of Eugene Volokh, a Russian-born UCLA law professor whose article \u201cThe Commonplace Second Amendment\u201d has been cited in recent court rulings favoring gun rights, commenters sounded less partisan than thoughtful in response to a blog entry where Mr. Volokh acknowledged no one knows if arming more Americans in anticipation of mass shootings would ultimately save lives.\n\n\u201cA decade ago, or so, there were a few high school shootings,\u201d writes commenter Joe JP. \u201cMy interest would include why they occurred at that time, particularly since there did not seem to be some novel change in the law or presence of guns. Why are we having another slew of cases now as compared to five years ago? Is this a cyclical thing?\u201d\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s massacre in Connecticut became the 7th major mass shooting in the US this year, police later Friday arrested a Cedar Lake, Indiana, man who owned 47 guns, after he threatened to go to a local elementary school and open fire.\n\nOn Sunday, a man in Newport Beach, California, fired 50 shots in a mall parking lot, hurting no one. In July, a college dropout proclaiming he was \u201cThe Joker\u201d opened fire on a midnight screening of a \u201cBatman\u201d movie in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people and injuring 58, many of them seriously.\n\nPrevious massacres, including the Aurora shootings, have barely budged American support for the Second Amendment, which the Supreme Court in recent years has ruled applies to Americans armed to defend themselves and their homes. However, some polls suggest a majority of Americans do support some gradual restrictions on gun ownership.\n\nSensing a pause from pro-gun rights groups and individuals, pro-gun control advocates like Huffington Post columnist Robert Cavnar, a licensed gun owner, noted that \u201cthe conversation has finally begun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe age and innocence of the victims in this massacre, coming right on the heels of the Oregon shootings and the Jovan Belcher murder-suicide, have finally caused the self-imposed discussion moratorium, enforced by the millions of dollars invested by the NRA and gun manufacturers, to be ended,\u201d he writes. As proof, he says, \u201cThe NRA has uncharacteristically gone subterranean since the shooting, and its website is completely silent on the matter.\u201d\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R) of Texas became the only national voice to wave the Second Amendment banner in the wake of the shootings. He told Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace on Sunday that the massacre could have been averted had the principal been heavily armed.\n\n\u201cChris, I wish to God [slain principal Dawn Hochsprung] had had an M-4 in her office, locked up so when she heard gunfire, she pulls it out\u2026and takes him out\u2026before he can kill those precious kids,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, the debate on gun control and the role of firearms in American society continues to intensify.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Halts Arctic Oil Drilling Lease Sales Following Shell's Suspension of Exploration\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration has announced the cancellation of plans to sell oil drilling rights in the Arctic Sea through 2017, marking a significant shift in policy following Shell Oil's decision last month to suspend its oil exploration in offshore Alaskan waters. The Interior Department's decision to cancel further oil leases was prompted by Shell's announcement of disappointing results from a well in the Chukchi Sea.\n\nSecretary of the Interior Sally Jewell stated, \"In light of Shell's announcement, the amount of acreage already under lease and current market conditions, it does not make sense to prepare for lease sales in the Arctic in the next year and a half.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups, who criticized the administration for approving permits for Shell to drill while President Obama was highlighting the effects of climate change in Alaska, have applauded Friday's move. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) called it \"an essential reprieve\" for Arctic Waters. NRDC's Franz Matzner commented, \"The next step should be to take Arctic and Atlantic waters off the table to oil and gas drilling for good.\"\n\nIn addition to canceling further lease sales, the department also denied requests by Shell and the Norwegian company Statoil to extend their existing leases beyond 10 years. Both companies had asked for five-year extensions, arguing that they should have more time due to regulations preventing them from exploring for oil. Without those extensions, the leases will expire by 2020.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) criticized the decision, calling it \"absurd.\" She argued that the Interior Department is using the lack of drilling to justify canceling the lease sales, and that the department is throwing up regulatory roadblocks to prevent drilling. Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, stated, \"This is a stunning, short-sighted move that betrays the Interior Department's commitments to Alaska and the best interests of our nation's long-term energy security.\" She added, \"Today's decision is the latest in a destructive pattern of hostility toward energy production in our state that began the first day this administration took office, and continued ever since.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Praise for Obama Administration's Diplomatic Post Closures Amid Terror Threat; National Security Debate Shifts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration's decision to close diplomatic posts across various regions, from Central Asia to North Africa, has received bipartisan support from lawmakers who view it as a prudent response to a perceived serious threat of potential terrorist attacks.\n\nIn a series of interviews on Sunday, lawmakers from both parties commended the administration's decision, citing the credible nature of the intelligence that suggests the attacks could occur in the regions affected by the closures, or elsewhere.\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) praised the administration's move on CBS-TV's Face the Nation, stating, \"The administration's call to close these embassies... was actually a very smart call.\"\n\nRep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) echoed similar sentiments on ABC-TV's This Week, saying, \"What we have to do now is the most important issue, is protect Americans throughout the world.\"\n\nInitially, the State Department had announced the closure of 19 diplomatic posts on Sunday, including Abu Dhabi, Amman, Cairo, Riyadh, Dhahran, Jeddah, Doha, Dubai, Kuwait, Manama, Muscat, Sanaa, Tripoli, Antanarivo, Bujumbura, Djibouti, Khartoum, Kigali, and Port Louis. However, posts in nine locations were set to reopen on Monday: Dhaka, Algiers, Nouakchott, Kabul, Herat, Mazar el Sharif, Baghdad, Basrah, and Erbil.\n\nThe heightened terror threat has not only brought lawmakers together but has also shifted the focus of the ongoing debate about National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance programs. The subject, which had been a contentious issue following the revelations by \"NSA leaker\" Edward Snowden, has now shifted to a discussion of the effectiveness of these programs.\n\nAs reported by NPR's Dina Temple-Raston, the weekend terror threat has opened up a new front in the debate over the NSA's surveillance programs. The Hill notes that a handful of lawmakers, primarily national security hawks, have used the Sunday news shows to argue that the NSA programs have been successful in uncovering potential terrorist attacks.",
    " Title: Biden Secures Victory in Maine, Leading Democratic Presidential Race After Super Tuesday\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, former Vice President Joe Biden has emerged victorious in the Democratic presidential primary in Maine, making it the last state to be called in the Super Tuesday contests. This victory marks a significant comeback for Biden, who now boasts 10 primary wins, leaving Sen. Bernie Sanders with four.\n\nThe self-proclaimed Democratic socialist, Sanders, managed to secure victories in his home state of Vermont, as well as Colorado and Utah. However, the largest prize of the night, the delegate-rich state of California, went to Biden.\n\nBiden, initially the unrivaled front-runner, faced a setback in the early primary contests with lackluster performances in Iowa and New Hampshire. A slight rebound in Nevada's caucuses and a decisive victory in South Carolina, a state the campaign had long considered their \"firewall,\" provided Biden with the momentum he needed to regain his position.\n\nThe withdrawal of more moderate candidates, such as former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and their endorsement of Biden, consolidated the moderate vote in Tuesday's states. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg also suspended his campaign and endorsed Biden, further narrowing the field. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who had a disappointing Super Tuesday performance, remains in the race.\n\nAddressing his supporters Tuesday night, Biden said, \"To those who've been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign.\" He added, \"It may be over for the other guy.\"\n\nIn response to Sanders' ad showing former President Barack Obama praising him, the Biden campaign issued a rebuke.\n\nAs of 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, Biden had 566 delegates, while Sanders had 501. A candidate needs 1,991 delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nSanders, despite finishing behind Biden Tuesday night, expressed optimism about his campaign's position. \"I am excited about where we are. We have come a long, long way,\" Sanders said Tuesday night.\n\nThe next tests for the candidates will be on March 10, when voters in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, and Washington state head to the polls. On St. Patrick's Day, March 17, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio will have their chance to vote. Georgia will hold its primary on March 24.",
    " Title: The Rise of Donald Trump: A Symptom of Economic Disillusionment Among Republican Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the last four decades, the Republican Party has been peddling an economic message that champions the prosperity of the wealthy as a shared success for all. However, the recent surge of Donald Trump, a candidate who has been described as a demagogue, marks a significant shift in the party's traditional voter base. The GOP establishment has faced a series of humiliating defeats at the hands of a candidate whose rhetoric echoes elements of fascist leaders like Benito Mussolini and George Wallace.\n\nThe economic narrative the right wing of the Republican Party, often referred to as the Money Party, has been selling to its voters since the 1970s is rooted in the belief that excessive government regulation, high taxes, and an overly generous welfare system have stifled the American economy. This narrative suggests that the American dream has been eroded due to government intervention, leaving ordinary Americans with stagnant bank accounts despite their hard work.\n\nHowever, a closer examination of the economic history of the United States since 1945 reveals a different story. Inflation-adjusted per capita GDP in the U.S. grew from $17,490 in 1945 to $27,837 in 1974, and then jumped to $55,185 in 2014, nearly doubling since 1974. This indicates that the country is twice as rich per person now as it was then.\n\nYet, the average household income of the bottom 50% of American households was $25,475 in 1974, and $26,520 in 2014. In other words, half the population has not benefited from the additional $10 trillion of national wealth generated over the past four decades. This group includes half of the nation's middle class.\n\nMeanwhile, the average household income of the top 5% of American households has increased from $187,729 to $332,347, while the income of the top 0.01% (approximately the nation's 13,000 wealthiest households) has grown by about seven-fold, from less than $5 million to more than $30 million per year.\n\nTrump's appeal extends beyond his exploitation of racism and xenophobia, as he taps into the economic anxieties of white middle and working-class voters. These voters are angry about their economic circumstances and the empty promises of a Republican party that caters primarily to the rich. The half of America that lives on $40,000, $25,000, or even $10,000 per year is uninterested in issues like cutting capital gains taxes, eliminating the estate tax, or slashing Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThe contemporary Republican party, it seems, exists to protect the economic interests of the donor class, a fact that has been hidden behind culture war issues and racial and ethnic animosities for the past four decades. The disillusionment felt by many voters is a reflection of this disconnect between the party's rhetoric and the economic realities faced by middle- and working-class Americans.\n\nThe rise of Donald Trump is a stark reminder that the Republican Party must reevaluate its approach to economic policy if it hopes to regain the trust of its voters. The party's failure to address the economic concerns of its base has led to the election of a candidate whose message, crude and bombastic as it may be, resonates with the experiences of many Americans.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Decision in Ferguson Shooting: A Look at the Latest Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson for the shooting of Michael Brown, several significant developments have unfolded in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson sat down with ABC News, marking his first public statement since the shooting on August 9. Wilson described the altercation, stating that Brown did not have his hands up when he was fatally shot.\n\nPresident Obama, speaking from Chicago at a scheduled immigration event, condemned the \"destructive\" behavior that led to fires, gunfire, and property damage. He acknowledged the many peaceful protests across the country, expressing his support for them.\n\nMissouri Governor Jay Nixon addressed safety measures going forward, promising to deploy more than 2,200 troops to maintain peace in Ferguson. Ferguson Mayor James Knowles criticized the National Guard for a slow response, stating that they were not deployed quickly enough to prevent violence and arson in the wake of the grand jury's decision.\n\nOfficer Darren Wilson will speak with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on World News Tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET, marking his first public interview since the shooting.\n\nBenjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Michael Brown's family, criticized the prosecutor who handled the grand jury, stating, \"We object as publicly and loudly as we can on behalf of Michael Brown Jr.'s family that this process is broken. The process should be indicted.\"\n\nThe grand jury documents, released following the decision, provide detailed accounts of the altercation. Wilson told the grand jury that Brown \"looked like a demon\" and that the altercation was like \"fighting Hulk Hogan.\"\n\nAuthorities reported 61 arrests, with 59 of those arrested being local residents. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar stated that it took \"10,000 policemen\" to control the chaos, describing the situation as worse than the worst night in August.\n\nTwitter reported over 3.5 million tweets sent by midnight ET after the decision was announced at about 9 p.m. Social media users shared their thoughts and reactions on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nThe streets of Ferguson were calmer on Tuesday morning, with 29 people arrested, two police cars set on fire, at least a dozen buildings burned, and looting and rioting reported. One officer was shot (not seriously), and police used tear gas to disperse crowds. However, no deaths or serious injuries have been reported. Flight restrictions out of Lambert-St. Louis International Airport have expired.\n\nSt. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar reported at a 1:30 a.m. CT news conference that at least a dozen buildings were burning and at least 150 gunshots had been fired, none by police.\n\nIn a letter released to KSDK-TV in St. Louis, Wilson thanked his supporters, stating, \"I would like to thank you all for standing up for me during this stressful time. Your support and dedication is amazing and it is still hard to believe that all of these people that I have never met are doing so much for me.\"\n\nMichael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, reacted emotionally to the grand jury's decision. Attorney Benjamin Crump delivered the news to McSpadden, who screamed and sobbed. McSpadden expressed a desire to meet with the prosecutor, but no such meeting has been scheduled as of yet.\n\nA police officer was shot and a woman killed in a St. Louis suburb south of Ferguson, with the suspect still at large. The Federal Aviation Administration restricted flights into and out of Lambert International Airport to \"provide a safe environment for law enforcement activities.\"\n\nProtests turned violent in Ferguson, with demonstrators taunting police, shattering windows, and setting fire to two St. Louis County police cars. Looters plundered a Walgreens and Autozone store, while a Little Caesars pizza restaurant and local beauty shop were set ablaze.\n\nDemonstrators reacted more peacefully in several other cities, including New York, Oakland, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Washington, D.C. In New York, hundreds marched to Times Square chanting, \"No justice, no peace, no racist police,\" and carrying signs that read, \"Jail Killing Cops\" and \"Resistance Is Justified.\" Protesters in Oakland, Calif., laid in the middle of an intersection in silent protest, then marched down Broadway shouting, \"Hands up, don't shoot,\" and \"Black lives matter \u2014 all lives matter.\"\n\nPresident Obama urged calm, stating, \"We are a nation built on the rule of law. We need to accept this decision was the grand jury's to make.\" He also acknowledged that the situation in Ferguson speaks to broader problems that the nation still faces.",
    " Title: Mueller's Indictment Deepens Legal Peril for Trump Campaign Aide Richard Gates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could potentially intensify the legal troubles for former Trump campaign aide Richard Gates, Special Counsel Robert Mueller unveiled new criminal charges against Gates and his longtime business partner, Paul Manafort, on Thursday. The charges include tax evasion, bank fraud, and money laundering.\n\nThe superseding indictment, released Thursday, increases the legal pressure on Gates, who had been expected to strike a deal with Mueller to avoid trial. According to Seth Waxman, a former federal prosecutor, the timing of the filing is strategically aimed at maximizing the pressure on Gates, in case he is wavering on cooperating with the investigation.\n\n\"It is designed to continue to ratchet up the pressure on Manafort and Gates to flip,\" Waxman said. He added that the new filings suggest Mueller is likely sending a clear signal to Gates \"that he is not messing around.\"\n\nGates, who worked closely with Manafort for over a decade, is a key figure for Mueller due to his close relationship with Manafort. Their collaboration included lobbying work for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine, and Gates' testimony at trial could prove damaging for Manafort.\n\nSteven Cash, a lawyer at Day Pitney who specializes in criminal litigation and national security-related matters, said, \"If Manafort really did have a second in command comparable to a close confidant, you don\u2019t get much better than that. It\u2019s like having the second in command of a company testify against the CEO.\"\n\nA plea agreement with Gates would put significant pressure on Manafort to cut a deal of his own. If he flipped, it's possible he could provide Mueller with inside information about any contact between the Trump campaign and Moscow during the summer of 2016, a key period when Russia began orchestrating the release of hacked Democratic emails.\n\nRon Hosko, a former FBI assistant director, stated, \"The Manafort indictment is serious, is ugly, and is very likely backed by large volumes of evidence.\" He added, \"Gates can drive a final nail.\"\n\nPresident Trump has consistently denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia, describing the allegations as a \"hoax.\" Mueller's team first unveiled an indictment against Manafort and Gates in late October, which included bank transactions and accused them of money laundering, bank fraud, and other financial crimes stemming from work overseas that pre-dated their involvement in Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nFormer prosecutors suggest that Gates' testimony, should he choose to cooperate, could help prosecutors sort through their evidence against Manafort. He could also fill in holes in timelines and help walk prosecutors through some of the complex financial transactions that he and Manafort are accused of carrying out.\n\nThe possibility of Gates testifying could be enough to get Manafort to cooperate with Mueller's prosecutors, which is likely their main goal. Manafort worked for Trump's campaign for six months before resigning under pressure in August 2016 over reports of his dealings with a pro-Russia oligarch in Ukraine. He was in the room for a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who had promised Donald Trump Jr. damaging information on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign, and could provide inside information about any contact between the campaign and Russia.\n\nIf Gates were to strike a plea deal, he would be the fourth known witness to cooperate with Mueller's investigation, in addition to former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, and a California man ensnared in the probe for selling bank account numbers to foreigners committing identity fraud.\n\n\"I think the question is not are there going to be more indictments and guilty pleas,\" said Jack Sharman, a former Whitewater special counsel. \"I think there will be. The larger question is ultimately what is the relation of any of those offenses to the original core mission of the special counsel, who was appointed because of concerns over presidential campaign involvement.\"",
    " Title: Monsanto Ordered to Pay $289 Million in Landmark Glyphosate Cancer Case\n\nIn a landmark ruling, a California jury has ordered chemical giant Monsanto to pay $289 million in damages to Dewayne Johnson, a man who claimed that the company's Roundup and RangerPro weedkillers containing glyphosate caused his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This is the first lawsuit to go to trial alleging a glyphosate link to cancer.\n\nThe jury found that Monsanto knew its products were dangerous and failed to warn consumers about the potential risks. The company, which was recently acquired by the German conglomerate Bayer AG, has denied that glyphosate causes cancer and plans to appeal the ruling.\n\nDewayne Johnson, a groundskeeper, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2014. He regularly used a form of RangerPro while working at a school in Benicia, California. The implications of this verdict will likely lead to hundreds of other claims against Monsanto.\n\nGlyphosate is the world's most common weedkiller, and the science about its safety is still far from settled. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the World Health Organization's cancer agency, concluded that it was \"probably carcinogenic to humans.\" However, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continues to insist that glyphosate is safe when used carefully.\n\nThe EPA's assessment has been questioned by campaigners, who cite evidence of inappropriate industry involvement in the decision-making process. Some Democrats have even called for a Department of Justice investigation into alleged collusion between government officials and Monsanto.\n\nIn California, where a judge recently ruled that coffee must carry a cancer warning, the agriculture industry sued to prevent a similar label for glyphosate. In Europe, the battle over glyphosate has been fierce, with French President Emmanuel Macron trying to ban it despite resistance from some lawmakers and the European Commission's recent granting of a five-year license.\n\nJurors found that Monsanto acted with \"malice\" and that its weedkillers contributed \"substantially\" to Johnson's terminal illness. The jury ordered the agricultural multi-national to pay $250 million in punitive damages, along with other costs that brought the total figure to almost $290 million.\n\nJohnson's lawyer, Brent Wisner, said the jury's verdict showed that the evidence against the product was \"overwhelming.\" He added that the ruling was just \"the tip of the spear\" of future legal cases.\n\nIn a statement after the ruling, Monsanto said it was \"sympathetic to Mr. Johnson and his family\" but would \"continue to vigorously defend this product, which has a 40-year history of safe use.\" The company also stated that \"more than 800 scientific studies and reviews - and conclusions by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the US National Institutes of Health, and regulatory authorities around the world - support the fact that glyphosate does not cause cancer, and did not cause Mr. Johnson's cancer.\"",
    " Title: Nation on High Alert as Investigations Intensify Following Boston Marathon Explosions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Boston Marathon explosions, investigators have made significant progress in their search for the perpetrators. Remnants of the explosive devices, including parts of pressure cookers packed with nails, ball bearings, and black powder, a dark nylon backpack or duffel bag, circuit boards, wires, and other timing device components, have been recovered. Investigators aim to trace these items back to their point of sale and compile a list of potential buyers.\n\nA piece of a pressure cooker lid was found on a rooftop near the blast site, providing a sense of the immense force of the explosion. The investigation, now in its third day, has also involved the scrutiny of numerous videos and photographs from surveillance cameras in nearby businesses, as well as from marathon spectators' smartphones and television crews filming the event. As of yet, no one has claimed responsibility for the explosions.\n\nAcross the nation, there has been a palpable sense of unease, with increased reports of suspicious packages. In New York City, the scene of a devastating bombing in 1995, City Hall was briefly evacuated Wednesday morning as authorities examined a stolen rental truck parked outside. Officials in Oklahoma City reported no bomb, while parts of two Senate office buildings were shut down in Washington due to reports of suspicious letters or packages. The Secret Service also reported a letter addressed to President Obama containing a suspicious substance, which was intercepted at a screening facility outside the White House, leading to the arrest of a suspect Wednesday evening.\n\nIn New York, the police department reported a 300% increase in reports of suspicious packages between Monday afternoon and Tuesday midnight, compared to the same time period last year. The John Joseph Moakley United States Court House in Boston was also evacuated Wednesday afternoon, with bomb-sniffing dogs called in for a \"code red\" investigation.\n\nAs the investigation into the Boston Marathon explosions continues, the nation remains on high alert, with authorities urging vigilance and cooperation in the face of these unprecedented events.",
    " Title: Media's Portrayal of Hillary Clinton and the Benghazi Report: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent release of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's report on the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, has sparked a media frenzy, with headlines suggesting a direct indictment of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. However, a closer examination of the report reveals that Clinton's name does not appear in the bipartisan portions of the review.\n\nThe media's portrayal of the report has been a Rorschach test, with many outlets stretching to find signs of wrongdoing on Clinton's part. The Washington Post, for instance, acknowledged that the only references to Clinton came from partisan Republicans in an addendum, not from the review itself. Yet, headlines such as \"For Clinton, Benghazi report has some good, mostly bad - but no ugly\" and \"Benghazi report ups pressure on Hillary\" suggest a more damning narrative.\n\nCNN's Wolf Blitzer described the report as \"fueling heated debate, partisan debate, about her leadership,\" while correspondent Elise Labbott argued that Clinton would \"have to address Benghazi during\" any 2016 campaign. Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin even accused the media of being \"incurious\" when it comes to Clinton, labeling Benghazi as Clinton's \"drip, drip, drip problem.\"\n\nThe question of \"leadership\" has been a lopsided one, with many media outlets using the Senate report as an indictment of Clinton's leadership. However, it is important to note that Clinton has acknowledged ultimate responsibility for any bureaucratic shortcomings that played a role in the tragedy in Benghazi.\n\nWhat is problematic about the media's use of the Senate's review as a reflection on Clinton's leadership is that the reports ostensibly exploring Clinton's leadership make no mention of the fact that one of her last acts as Secretary of State was to fully accept and begin implementing the findings of the Accountability Review Board (ARB), an independent, nonpartisan review panel that looked into what went wrong and how to prevent a similar tragedy in the future.\n\nThe ARB, like the Senate report, also singled out bureaucrats, not the Secretary of State, for scrutiny over diplomatic security failures. Four mid-ranked department officials were suspended for those failures; according to Ambassador Thomas Pickering, one of the chairmen of the ARB, their \"future careers [s]\" are \"finished.\"\n\nOne of the pillars of the right-wing's Benghazi hoax has been to accuse Clinton of being dismissive of the tragedy during her Congressional testimony when she asked, \"What difference, at this point, does it make\" what led the attackers to target the diplomatic facility on that day. Often left out of the sound bite is what Clinton said next: \"It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again.\"\n\nThe ARB laid out dozens of recommendations as to how to prevent future tragedies, recommendations largely in line with those contained in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report. Those recommendations are being implemented. It's woefully inadequate to leave that fact out of a discussion of leadership.",
    " Title: Trump's Trade War with China: A Look at the Current State of Affairs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn March 2018, President Donald Trump declared that \"trade wars are good and easy to win.\" However, over a year later, it appears that Trump is losing the trade war he initiated with China.\n\nThe tariffs imposed by Trump on Chinese goods have reportedly slowed China's economic growth, with most data sources indicating a slight dip in 2018. This slowdown could be due to the Chinese government's efforts to control credit growth, but many experts believe that Trump's tariffs have also impacted business confidence and investment.\n\nThe U.S., on the other hand, has also been affected by the trade war. The increased cost of Chinese-made products due to tariffs has led to higher prices for American consumers and factories. Two studies by trade economists suggest that the U.S. economy has suffered losses in the tens of billions of dollars annually due to the trade war.\n\nChina's retaliation has been particularly hard on American farmers, with the country halting most soybean imports from the U.S. Inventories have piled up, agricultural exports have declined, and farm incomes have suffered. Desperate farmers have appealed to Trump for help, to which he responded with direct payments. However, relying on government aid is not a sustainable business model, and farm bankruptcies have begun to rise.\n\nChina's autocratic regime and its residents' willingness to endure economic hardship have given it an advantage in a trade war with the U.S. Trump's trade truce with China, enacted in late 2018, left most of the U.S.'s key goals, such as intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, forced technology transfer, and access to the Chinese market, unfulfilled.\n\nThe trade war is not just about tariffs; it also involves the struggle to control the future of high technology. The U.S. has been trying to pressure American allies not to buy 5G wireless technology from Huawei Technologies Co., China's leading telecommunications manufacturer. However, Germany recently announced it would not shut Huawei out, dealing a significant blow to this effort.\n\nThe U.S. has also implemented export controls on many technology products, which could hurt Chinese tech in the short term but could also push China to accelerate its efforts to replicate and surpass U.S. technology. If China becomes a technological peer, its companies will begin to compete more directly with American ones, as Japanese companies did in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's trade war with China is showing signs of weakness on multiple fronts. While it has inflicted some damage, China has proven resilient and is now fighting back effectively. It appears that trade wars may not be as easy to win as Trump initially believed.",
    " Title: Second Circuit Court of Appeals Ruling on Trump's Twitter Account: A Closer Look at the Legal Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that former President Donald Trump cannot block Twitter users from following his @realDonaldTrump account. While the decision, at first glance, appears to be a straightforward application of First Amendment law, it contains a crucial error that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of speech on private social-media platforms.\n\nBoiled down to its essence, the court's reasoning contained two key elements. First, it ruled that Trump's Twitter account represents an outlet for official communications and interactions that is controlled by President Trump. Second, it found that under these circumstances, Trump's decision to block users represents impermissible state action undertaken to suppress dissent.\n\nHowever, the first element is fundamentally mistaken. By no traditional legal measure of \"control,\" Trump does not control his Twitter account. Twitter owns and controls his account, and he has no legal right to wrest control of it from Twitter. The court's misunderstanding of the platform is made evident by this deeply flawed analysis.\n\nThe fact that government control over property is temporary, or that the government does not \"own\" the property in the sense that it holds title to the property, is not determinative of whether the property is, in fact, sufficiently controlled by the government to make it a forum for First Amendment purposes. Temporary control by the government can still be control for First Amendment purposes.\n\nThere is no \"control\" at all, temporary or otherwise. When a politician rents a theater or other private venue, there is typically an exchange of money and a rental agreement that explicitly grants enforceable legal rights to access the property and control others' access to the property, and\u2014critically\u2014limits the landlord's power during the course of the rental.\n\nCompare that level of control to the absolute lack of rights the user has under Twitter's terms of service:\n\nWe may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Twitter Rules or Periscope Community Guidelines, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (iv) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable.\n\nThere is no exchange of money, the user has no right to the platform, and Twitter can not only eliminate your access entirely but censor any single tweet. If it chooses, it can even remove Trump's ability to block, mute, or take any other action. And that's not all\u2014when you use Twitter, your speech isn't even purely \"your\" speech anymore. Twitter grants itself the right to your communications, too:\n\nBy submitting, posting, or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).\n\nWriting in response to the trial court's ruling against Trump last year, law professor Greg Dolin compared Twitter to a radio call-in show that is hosting a government official as a guest. The politician has no right to be on the show, the host can send the politician packing at any time, and the host has ultimate control over not only the politician's presence but also any callers' speech. In other words, Trump remains on Twitter entirely at Twitter's discretion.\n\nIn that circumstance, there is no \"public forum.\" There is instead a public official using a private platform to attempt to amplify his specific message, with the permission of the entity that controls the platform. The court's ruling, in this circumstance, represents government intervention in Twitter's control of its own service. The court is overriding the permissions Twitter gave its own user.\n\nMoreover, the court gives short shrift to Trump's own free-speech rights under the government-speech doctrine. Again, to borrow one of Professor Dolin's analogies, \"If a politician is holding a rally in a park (a traditional public forum), it doesn't follow that he must permit critics to share the stage with him.\" The Twitter thread beneath any tweet can undermine or amplify the president's chosen message. So long as Twitter grants the user the ability to regulate his or her Twitter replies, then that regulation is an integral part of the user's expression.\n\nIf, say, Kamala Harris wins the White House and Twitter permits her to use its services to announce that she's forming a committee to study the feasibility of reparations for slavery, does she then have to allow that thread to be hijacked by white nationalists and other vile alt-right voices? I say no. The Second Circuit says yes.\n\nIt's common for social-media users to use phrases like \"my Facebook page\" or \"my Twitter feed.\" Yes, it is \"my\" speech on social media, but it is not my page or my feed. A private company is allowing a public official to use the private company's services to amplify his message. The private company is in legal control, not the public official, and if members of the public don't want to be blocked on a Twitter feed, they should take their objections to Twitter, not to federal court.",
    " Title: \"Brooklyn Resident Turns Passion for Food and Service into Philanthropic Cafe\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a quiet corner of Park Slope, Brooklyn, resides a unique culinary venture, the brainchild of a young entrepreneur, Ms. Brodie. At 27, she has transformed her passion for food and service into a philanthropic cafe, providing not only a dining experience but also a platform for personal and professional growth for its students.\n\nMs. Brodie's journey began as a simple idea, one that she had long believed someone else would pursue. However, as she recounted during our conversation, her husband's question, \"What are you waiting for?\", spurred her into action.\n\nHer family's history is deeply intertwined with food and service. Her grandmother, a South African, published a well-known cookbook in the 1960s, with proceeds benefiting the Union of Jewish Women. Her father, a teacher, instilled in her the importance of service by driving her to deliver leftover food from local restaurants to shelters. Sundays were spent giving cooking lessons to friends and delivering extra meals to shelters to share with residents.\n\nPost-college, Ms. Brodie volunteered at a homeless shelter before working at the Human Rights Campaign in Washington. It was during this time that she was struck by the idea of a different approach to food distribution and service to the less fortunate.\n\nWith no formal background in the food industry, Ms. Brodie honed her skills at the Institute of Culinary Education in Lower Manhattan and attended a food business boot camp in Harlem. She also gained practical experience by working shifts at restaurants.\n\nAfter months of brainstorming, networking, and countless emails, Ms. Brodie's vision became a reality in June. Nearly half of her students had received job offers before completing the program.\n\nMs. Brodie's cafe is more than just a place to eat; it's a testament to the power of passion, service, and the transformative potential of education. Her story serves as an inspiration to many, demonstrating that with determination and a willingness to learn, anyone can make a difference in their community.",
    " Title: California Farmers Frustrated Over Delayed Compensation for High-Speed Rail Project\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia farmers in the Central Valley are expressing their dissatisfaction over the state's seizure of their land for the high-speed railway project and the subsequent delay in compensating them for the seized property and related expenses. The farmers claim that the California High-Speed Rail Authority has offered various excuses for the delayed payments.\n\nJohn Diepersloot, a fruit farmer who cleared a large parcel of his peach orchard for the train, told The Los Angeles Times, \"I am out a quarter-million bucks on infrastructure, and they haven't paid a dime for a year. I don't have that kind of money.\"\n\nMark Wasser, a Sacramento-based attorney representing more than 70 farmers and businesses affected by the project, stated, \"The property owners are very frustrated that the high-speed rail authority don't seem to know what they actually need. We have farmers who the authority has come back four times to change where they want to take.\"\n\nRail authority officials acknowledged the delayed payments but have not provided a reason for the delay. Don Odell, the authority's chief of real property, said in a statement to Fox News, \"We strive to work closely with affected property owners to minimize the impact the project has on them and to ensure that they receive fair market value, consistent with state law, for their land and other expenses they incur due to the construction of the high-speed rail system.\"\n\nCalifornia's high-speed rail project has been plagued with delays, shifting plans, and questions over cost and funding since its inception. The projected $79 billion project is years behind schedule, with the latest estimate for completion set for 2033.\n\nIn February, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to put the rail line between Los Angeles and San Francisco on hold in favor of a much-shorter line between the cities of Bakersfield and Merced. This move had Republican lawmakers in the Golden State calling for a referendum vote on the project.\n\nIn his State of the State address in February, Newsom argued against the frequent complaint that the Merced-Bakersfield line would be a \"train to nowhere\" and said that a high-speed railway would \"form the backbone of a reinvigorated Central Valley economy.\"\n\nPresident Trump labeled the entire high-speed rail project a \"disaster\" and called for Sacramento to return the funds given to the state by the federal government. In March, the head of the state's rail authority fired back at Trump's effort to block more federal dollars from going to the California project. The Federal Railroad Administration had given California $2.5 billion to construct a Los Angeles-to-San Francisco link, with another $929 million pledged. However, federal authorities and the president claimed the terms of the federal grant had not been met and threatened to withhold any future payments while demanding repayment for the funds already doled out to California.",
    " Title: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo Faces Challenges as Democratic Party Shifts Left\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is heavily favored to win a third term in November, is facing challenges as the Democratic Party nationwide moves to the left. The incumbent Democrat spent $18 million to fend off a challenge from political novice Cynthia Nixon in a bitter primary contest.\n\nDuring the campaign, Cuomo agreed to restore voting rights for parolees and moved closer to marijuana legalization. However, he may need to address concerns about his progressive credentials as the Democratic Party increasingly prioritizes issues like increased ballot access and single-payer healthcare.\n\nPatrick Egan, a politics professor at New York University, stated, \"If he wants to have a chance in a Democratic primary, as Democratic voters really turn to the left, he\u2019s going to have to lay out some progressive credentials.\" Cuomo has denied any intention of running for president in 2020.\n\nCuomo won the primary against Nixon, but the active challenge from his left nearly cost him his lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, who held off an unexpectedly strong challenge from an insurgent candidate. The primary also resulted in losses for several Democrats in the state Senate who had caucused with Republicans, giving that party control of the state's upper chamber.\n\nThe election of President Donald Trump has sparked a call to action for voters on the party's left flank. Voters in more liberal states like Florida and Georgia have nominated more progressive candidates for governor's races, and the movement has been seen in more conservative states as well.\n\nIn Oklahoma and West Virginia, teachers went on strike earlier this year to secure higher pay, and voters later defeated some lawmakers who voted against those efforts in Oklahoma's state contests. Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, noted, \"One of the things I\u2019ve been most struck by is how the reaction to Trump has so deeply affected state-level contests, even at the district level.\"\n\nIn New York, progressive anger was centered in the challenges to Democratic state senators who had handed the state's senate majority to Republicans. Several of those incumbents lost in Thursday's primary. The more liberal senate may help Cuomo, as he has positioned himself as a critic of President Trump.\n\nThe primary saw a significant increase in Democratic voter turnout, with nearly 1.5 million Democrats voting compared to less than 600,000 in 2014. Daniel Lewis, associate professor at Siena College, stated, \"He was able to effectively run against Washington and the Trump administration, messaging that may have helped draw energy from Democrats eager to participate in elections this year to check the President.\"",
    " Title: Obama Names Susan Rice as National Security Advisor Amidst Ongoing Controversy over Benghazi\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama announced on Wednesday the appointment of Susan Rice as his new National Security Advisor, a move that has been met with criticism from Republican lawmakers over her role in the aftermath of the 2012 Benghazi terror attack.\n\nSpeaking in the Rose Garden, Obama praised Rice as a \"tireless advocate\" for advancing America's interests. Rice will replace Tom Donilon, who is stepping down from the post. Notably, Rice does not require Senate confirmation for the job, as she currently serves as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nRice was initially considered for the position of Secretary of State, which does require Senate confirmation, but she withdrew from consideration amid the ongoing fallout from the Benghazi attack. In the aftermath of the attack, Rice appeared on five Sunday shows and stated that the attack was triggered by protests over an anti-Islam film, a narrative that many lawmakers at the time deemed inaccurate.\n\nThe administration later acknowledged that there were no protests on the ground in Benghazi, though they have not officially ruled out the possibility that protests elsewhere may have played a role. Republicans have criticized Rice for this account, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) accusing her of \"misleading\" the public on Benghazi.\n\nIn response to the news of Rice's appointment, Paul stated, \"How are they going to have the authority for people to believe what they're saying, when he's promoting someone who directly and deliberately misled the public over Benghazi?\"\n\nThe administration, under pressure from the media and Republicans, recently released the so-called \"talking points\" that showed officials drafting and re-drafting their storyline in advance of Rice's appearances. The intelligence community did cite demonstrations, but references to militant and Islamic extremist groups, and to prior security warnings and incidents, were ultimately removed after objections from various administration officials.\n\nIt remains unclear to what extent Rice was involved in this process. Officials, speaking in her defense, have stated that she was merely citing the assessment she was given on Sept. 16.\n\nMeanwhile, former Obama aide Samantha Power has been nominated to succeed Rice as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Power was an aide to the Obama campaign in 2008 but resigned after a report was published in which she called then-candidate Hillary Clinton a \"monster.\"\n\nA senior official told Fox News that Donilon decided to leave the National Security Advisor post after his wife took a job that involves a lot of foreign travel. Donilon has been in the administration since the start, first as deputy national security adviser.",
    " Title: Republican Lawmakers Express Concern Over Classified House Intelligence Committee Memo\n\nArticle:\n\nA classified report compiled by the House Intelligence Committee has raised concerns among Republican lawmakers, who describe its contents as \"shocking\" and \"explosive.\" The report, which is said to detail extensive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuse, has been the subject of discussions among Republican representatives since Thursday.\n\nAccording to National security journalist and Fox News contributor Sara Carter, the memo contains information about the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as well as the infamous Trump-Russia dossier. Carter reports that sources have suggested the memo could potentially lead to the end of Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation into President Trump and his associates.\n\nTexas Rep. Louie Gohmert and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz are among the lawmakers who have publicly expressed their concerns about the report. Gohmert tweeted a link to Carter's story, urging the release of the memo. Gaetz called for the document to be made public, stating that the facts contained in the memo are \"jaw-dropping\" and demand full transparency.\n\nFlorida Rep. Matt Gaetz also issued a statement on his congressional website, writing that the House must immediately make the memo publicly available. He expressed belief that the release of the information is necessary to preserve democracy.\n\nPennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry told Fox News that the contents of the report are \"alarming,\" likening the situation to the actions of the KGB. North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows told Fox News that the report is \"troubling\" and \"shocking.\"\n\nThe classified report is currently classified as Top Secret, and some lawmakers, including Rep. Ron DeSantis, have called for its public release as soon as possible. The report is said to raise serious questions about the upper echelon of the Obama DOJ and Comey FBI as it relates to the so-called collusion investigation.",
    " Title: Paul Ryan's Shift in Political Ambitions: Focus on Congressional Leadership and Policy Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Paul Ryan, the Republican Vice Presidential nominee in 2012, appears to be steering away from a potential White House bid and instead, is showing a growing interest in wielding influence within Congress. According to close associates, the grueling nature of presidential campaigns holds little appeal for Ryan, with one conservative source stating, \"He has no interest in the sheer grind of campaigning. It's hard to see him having 'what it takes.'\"\n\nRather than pursuing the presidency, Ryan seems to be captivated by the prospect of amassing power within Congress, using his influence in the House leadership to champion his signature Medicare plan and implement spending cuts. This strategy could eventually lead him to a bid for House GOP leader or even Speaker, a position he has reportedly warmed to since the 2012 election.\n\nSince his return from the failed vice presidential run, Ryan has found himself in a central role among House Republicans. He played a significant part in devising the GOP's new debt ceiling strategy and will shape a budget plan that will guide the GOP caucus on key issues. This growing influence within the party has led Ryan to believe that a national political ambition might dilute his growing power as an unofficial wingman to Speaker John Boehner.\n\nWhile Ryan continues to cultivate a national political and financial network, he has shown no signs of abandoning his congressional role. A top GOP source revealed that Ryan recently met with Spencer Zwick, Mitt Romney's fundraising guru, who expressed that a significant portion of the 2012 donor base is ready to back Ryan should he reconsider a White House run. Ryan also made a fundraising trip to Texas last month for his Prosperity PAC, where he was encouraged by top Romney donors to run for higher office.\n\nAlthough some conservatives suggested Ryan challenge Boehner immediately after the election, this is not a move Ryan would make. However, in conversations with longtime associates, a shift in Ryan's mood has been noticed. He seems open to eventually running for leadership, suggesting to two friends that this is the best and safest way to get Medicare and budget cuts done.\n\nRyan would not challenge Boehner or his No. 2, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, for their current positions. However, many Republicans believe Boehner may leave in a few years, perhaps after the 2014 election, to make way for the next generation of leaders. The safest path of all, according to these Republicans, would be Ryan's current trajectory: running the Budget Committee until 2014 and then taking over the Ways and Means Committee, where he could shape tax policy as he did for entitlements and spending.",
    " Title: Graham Calls for Special Counsel to Investigate FBI and DOJ, Citing Bias in 2016 Election Probes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has called for Congress to establish a special counsel to investigate the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ) over allegations of bias during the 2016 election campaign. Graham's call comes as newly released documents reveal the extent of anti-Trump sentiment among FBI employees who were instrumental in handling the investigation into Hillary Clinton's secret email server and the Russia investigation that became Robert Mueller's special counsel probe.\n\nThe documents, which include transcripts of interviews with fired FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, show they were determined to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president and had impeachment on their minds once he took office.\n\nGraham, speaking on the Senate floor, argued that Robert Mueller has had his chance to investigate President Trump, and it's now time to turn the microscope on the other side. He plans to introduce legislation to create another special counsel for this purpose.\n\n\"There's more than smoking guns here. There's overwhelming evidence that somebody outside the political system should look into,\" Graham said.\n\nThe Mueller investigation appears to be winding down, and Democrats are trying to ensure the findings are made public. The Democrat-led House approved a resolution Thursday morning urging Attorney General William P. Barr to release Mueller's final report. The resolution passed unanimously.\n\nHowever, when Senate Democrats attempted to raise the issue in the upper chamber, Graham objected. He said he would have allowed it if Democrats, in exchange, supported the special counsel Graham wants. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) refused.\n\n\"We let [Robert] Mueller look at all things Trump related to collusion and otherwise. Somebody needs to look at what happened on the other side and find out whether the FBI and the DOJ had two systems\u2014one supporting the person they wanted to win, and one out to get the person they wanted to lose,\" Graham said.\n\nIn remarks to The Heritage Foundation, Graham also announced that his committee will hold hearings on bias at the FBI and the DOJ. The hearings will focus on whether the bureau misled judges when it obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to spy on Trump campaign figure Carter Page.\n\nGraham promised that the Senate will get to the bottom of how the FBI obtained the warrant using a salacious, unverified dossier written by former British spy Christopher Steele. The dossier is full of unsubstantiated claims about Trump's ties to Russia.\n\nThe FBI used the dossier as part of its argument to the court to obtain the surveillance warrant on Page, and used it in subsequent renewals of the warrant. The dossier claims Page met with Russian officials with ties to Kremlin strongman Vladimir Putin during the 2016 campaign. Page has vehemently denied the claim. It also claims longtime Trump fixer Michael Cohen met with Russians in the Czech Republic to coordinate plans\u2014a charge he also has denied and has continued to deny even since turning against Trump.\n\nRepublicans have claimed the FBI has failed to disclose that the dossier's author was being funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign as opposition research. The dossier, along with texts between Strzok and Page, are among the Republicans' top evidence for alleged misconduct at the FBI and DOJ.\n\nThe House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees, when they were controlled last year by Republicans, called in Strzok and Page to give testimony about their own behavior. Those transcripts were secret until this week, when Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, now the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, inserted them into the Congressional Record.\n\nIn a transcript released Thursday, Strzok said his favorable opinion of Clinton did not influence the investigation into her use of her home server to send classified emails. However, he acknowledged that Clinton was not a target, subject, or suspect during the investigation. Instead, investigators viewed her as \"a critical player.\"\n\nHe also disputed assertions that his texts to Page showed animus toward Trump\u2014though his memory didn't jibe with that of Page, with whom he was having an adulterous affair at the time. She testified that a text she sent to Strzok telling him the Trump investigation would save the country from a \"menace\" referred to Trump. Strzok told the committee that he thought the menace was Russia.\n\nStrzok also disputed the meaning of the now-famous text in which Page fretted Trump would win the election. The former G-man responded \"No. No he won't. We'll stop it.\" This has been widely taken to mean the FBI would do what it had to do to prevent a Trump victory. While Strzok said in his testimony that he didn't recall writing the text, he did add that he believes the \"we\" he meant was the American voters.\n\n\"My answer 'No' was my personal belief that I did not think he would be,\" the fired agent said, adding later, \"My best sense looking at this text that I didn't recall until I read it very recently was that 'we' is my belief that the American people\u2014there is no way that they're going to elect him.\"\n\n\"What it is not is any statement that I would ever consider, let alone take any official action, to impact the presidency of the United States,\" he said.",
    " Title: The Return of the Government Shutdown: A Specter of the Past or a Hero of the Future?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, the specter of a federal government shutdown has once again emerged in the nation's capital, after a four-year hiatus. The looming threat, often maligned and shunned by the political establishment, has sparked a flurry of activity in Washington D.C., reminiscent of a classic Western showdown.\n\nThe catalyst for this political drama, as per President Donald Trump, is a $1.6 billion demand for a border wall. This wall, as many may recall, was initially promised to be funded by Mexico. However, given the numerous assurances during the campaign that Mexico would foot the bill approximately 6,256,765 times, the current demand for U.S. funding might seem somewhat confusing.\n\nThe prospect of a government shutdown, if it were to occur, would be an unusual one, marked by a mix of humor and concern. While longtime politicians typically react with peeved dismissal or unmitigated horror to the idea of a government shutdown, some are hedging their bets on this particular instance, which, as previously stated, is almost spectacularly peculiar.\n\nA look back at the last federal government shutdown in 2013 reveals a media-fueled panic, accompanied by an abundance of inside-the-Beltway lamentation. The shutdown was portrayed as a catastrophic event that would lead to mass chaos, disorder, and tragedy. However, upon closer examination, it appears that the majority of the government continued to function during the shutdown, and the nation managed to survive.\n\nThe 16-day shutdown, as many were warned, did not result in the political downfall of the Republicans, who ultimately recovered from their post-shutdown poll dip and went on to take back the Senate. The nation, thankfully, dodged the predicted mass tragedy. Washington D.C. returned to its usual business of self-importance, back-slapping, business-card swapping, and squandering money.\n\nHowever, the shutdown did serve as a reminder that many government officials may be full of hot air, and that expansive government bureaucracies might not be as important as they claim. The shutdown also highlighted the potential for Americans to question the necessity of certain government functions and expenditures.\n\nAs for the current government shutdown threat, we will have to wait and see how events unfold. In the meantime, it is worth noting that some states, such as Texas, manage to function effectively with a legislature that shuts down every other year. The nation, it seems, can survive without the constant presence of its political leaders.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Seek to Delay or Repeal Parts of ObamaCare, Particularly the Medical Device Tax\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Senate Democrats who were instrumental in the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) are now expressing doubts about the tax increases embedded in the legislation, particularly the medical device tax which is set to increase on January 1.\n\nSenators such as Al Franken (D-MN), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Charles Schumer (D-NY), Patty Murray (D-WA), John Kerry (D-MA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and others, who all voted in favor of the law, are now aiming to delay or repeal parts of ObamaCare.\n\nOne of the first provisions to be repealed was the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) Act, a long-term care insurance measure that was initially projected to reduce the deficit. However, after the bill passed, it was revealed to be a disaster, and it was subsequently repealed.\n\nAnother contentious provision was the so-called \"1099 provision,\" which would have required small businesses to file numerous new forms for various transactions. This provision, intended to pick up taxable transactions, was also repealed.\n\nNow, health-care industry lobbies that supported the subsidy-and-mandate-laden bill are lobbying to kill the cost-control measures that offset the costs of its subsidies. The Independent Payment Advisory Board, a cost-control measure, is a target for many providers. Additionally, the medical-device industry has convinced two Democratic Obamacare-backing Senators to attempt to repeal the medical device tax.\n\nDavid Bowen, who helped to craft the legislation, admitted after ObamaCare passed that it was not a cost reduction bill but a coverage bill. He explained that Senate Democrats had planned to provide insurance coverage first, \"knowing that that would bring on a cost battle second.\"\n\nThe increased costs in Massachusetts' RomneyCare, which served as a model for ObamaCare, have led to never-before-seen controls on insurers and health care providers, as well as tax increases. As Senate Democrats have become more familiar with what is in ObamaCare, the cost-control measures have gradually been stripped from the legislation.\n\nOne of the most damaging taxes in the long term is the medical device tax. The tax, which is expected to double due to the Taxmageddon increase, will impose a 2.3% tax on gross receipts, rather than profits. This tax will be imposed even if a company sells its products at a loss, ensuring that the tax is deceptively large.\n\nA recent study found that investment in medical research and development will fall by $2 billion per year due to the device tax\u2014a cautious estimate. The tax's adverse effect on investment will keep expensive medical devices from becoming affordable and widely available in the future.\n\nMore immediately, the device tax will increase the cost of essential medical products for consumers. Taxes on companies often end up being passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, and the device tax is no different. The actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services made it clear that Obamacare's \"fees and the [device] tax would generally be passed through to health consumers in the form of higher drug and device prices and higher insurance premiums.\"\n\nThe medical device industry is expected to be forced to fire between 14,500 and 47,100 workers due to the tax, according to one study. This could result in a shortage of medical device engineers, leading to a decay of medical device innovation and a decrease in life-saving devices.\n\nWhile Democrats' efforts to repeal the medical device tax are welcome, the challenge remains to find a way to pay for ObamaCare without imposing such burdensome taxes.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney Faces Challenges in Utah Senate Bid as State Auditor John Dougall Contemplates Primary Challenge\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has announced his candidacy for the Senate seat in Utah, a move that shows his sensitivity towards being labeled a carpetbagger. In a video shared on social media on Friday, Romney emphasized his connection to Utah, highlighting the state's unique character, work ethic, and community spirit.\n\nHowever, Romney's candidacy is not without controversy, as two prominent Republicans have raised questions about his commitment to Utah and his criticism of President Donald Trump. State Auditor John Dougall is one such Republican, who has expressed interest in challenging Romney in the primary election.\n\nDougall, in a telephone interview on Friday, stated, \"Some of the key things in Utah are that we want to make sure we have a senator who understands Utah issues, and those are clearly different than Massachusetts issues, for instance.\" He added that Romney had called him on Thursday evening to inform him of his impending announcement.\n\nWhen asked about the encouragement he is receiving, Dougall declined to reveal the sources but suggested it would come from those concerned about electing someone not aligned with Trump. For weeks, Dougall has been vocal on his Facebook page against a \"coronation\" of Romney, arguing for a clear understanding of Romney's political stance.\n\nEarlier this week, Utah Republican Party Chair Rob Anderson spoke dismissively of Romney's Utah credentials in an interview with the Salt Lake Tribune, stating, \"I think he\u2019s keeping out candidates that I think would be a better fit for Utah because, let\u2019s face it, Mitt Romney doesn\u2019t live here, his kids weren\u2019t born here, he doesn\u2019t shop here.\"\n\nIn response, Anderson later stated, \"I\u2019ve no doubt that Mitt Romney satisfies all qualifications to run for Senate, and as chairman of the Utah Republican Party, I will treat all candidates equally to ensure their path to the party nomination is honest and fair.\"\n\nThe primary election in Utah is expected to be a significant test of Romney's ability to overcome perceptions of being a political outsider in the state. Despite Romney's long-standing ties to Utah, the Democratic party is unlikely to pose a significant challenge for the Senate seat.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney's Overseas Trip: A Focus on Foreign Policy and Fundraising Amidst Domestic Economy Concerns\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2012 presidential election, former one-term Governor Mitt Romney embarks on an overseas trip, a move aimed at highlighting his foreign policy positions. This journey, however, may prove challenging for Romney, as domestic issues, particularly jobs and the economy, remain a priority for American voters.\n\nThe itinerary includes stops in Israel, Poland, and London, with the former two destinations chosen to contrast Romney's foreign policy vision with President Obama's, particularly in relation to the Middle East peace process, the Arab Spring, and the American relationship with Russia.\n\nRomney's advisers acknowledge the political risks of criticizing a sitting president abroad, but they believe that the candidate can make his points without explicit attacks. The trip also offers an opportunity to tap into the deep pockets of wealthy American expatriates, a strategy employed by both John McCain and Barack Obama during their previous campaigns.\n\nThe trip may present challenges for Romney, who has not spent his career focusing on national security issues. His earlier claim that Russia is the nation's \"No. 1 geopolitical foe\" drew criticism from foreign policy experts and even some Republicans.\n\nThe contrast between Romney and Obama is not entirely beneficial, as the latter's successes in the raid to kill Osama bin Laden and the winding down of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have been widely popular. Romney's absence from Afghanistan and Iraq may necessitate addressing his views on troop withdrawals.\n\nThe overseas trip also risks diverting attention from the domestic economy, a topic that Romney has emphasized as a key campaign issue. While Romney may discuss economic issues such as trade policy and the global banking system, Americans grappling with job loss or mortgage difficulties may find little relevance in his foreign policy discussions during his time abroad.\n\nIn contrast, President Obama will have the campaign trail to himself during Romney's absence, with a West Coast swing across Nevada, California, Oregon, and Washington, as well as stops in Louisiana before returning to the White House. Both candidates will speak early in the week at the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Reno, Nevada, but Romney's departure for Europe on Tuesday will leave Obama as the only candidate on the campaign trail.",
    " Title: Post-Election Lunch at the White House: A Tradition of Polite Discourse and Policy Discussions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a Washington tradition, President Obama is set to have lunch with congressional leaders at the White House on Friday, following the power shift away from his party. These post-election meetings, while often marked by a degree of awkwardness, serve as a platform for leaders to discuss policy matters and set the tone for the upcoming legislative session.\n\nThe discussions that take place behind closed doors can be frank, with the president advocating for his agenda, while the new majority presents its own legislative priorities, backed by the mandate of the voters. Despite the potential for contentious exchanges, these meetings are characterized by a spirit of professionalism and a shared goal of legislating effectively.\n\nIn the past, leaders have described these meetings using diplomatic terms, such as \"very positive,\" \"friendly,\" and \"constructive.\" For instance, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich once said, \"I thought it was a very positive meeting.\" Similarly, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi described her meeting as, \"We both extended the hand of friendship.\" Former President George W. Bush also noted, \"I would call it a very constructive and very friendly conversation.\"\n\nSheila Burke, who served as chief of staff to Bob Dole, likens these meetings to a blend of camaraderie and tension, referring to them as \"Kumbaya with an edge.\" In 1994, when Dole became majority leader of the Senate, he and Gingrich met with President Bill Clinton, marking the beginning of a contentious but ultimately productive relationship.\n\nBob Dole, after his meeting with Clinton, stated, \"I think the president understands that we're going to hit the ground running.\" This relationship proved particularly fruitful, as they collaborated on significant legislation, such as welfare reform.\n\nIn 2006, when Nancy Pelosi visited the White House as the first female speaker of the House, she and President Bush discussed the challenges that lay ahead, with Pelosi expressing the Democrats' intent to pass bills on issues like raising the minimum wage. Bush signed these bills into law, marking a solid working relationship between the two parties.\n\nJohn Lawrence, Pelosi's former chief of staff, emphasized the strength of this relationship, stating, \"That level of trust and collaboration could not have been constructed if there had not been a harmonious working relationship, notwithstanding policy differences.\" This relationship was put to the test during the 2008 financial crisis, when Pelosi, at Bush's request, pushed through the TARP legislation.\n\nAs President Obama sits down with GOP leaders this Friday, there are numerous policy differences to discuss, including Obamacare and immigration. However, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough remains optimistic, stating, \"Judging from the conversations that he, the president, has been having and many of us have been having with our colleagues up on the Hill, I think it should be a productive conversation.\"\n\nThe menu for the lunch remains undisclosed, leaving the public to wonder if buttery biscuits or Kentucky bourbon will be served. Regardless, the focus remains on the discussions that will shape the legislative agenda for the coming years.",
    " Title: CPAC 2020 Kicks Off with \"America vs. Socialism\" Theme, Focusing on Trump, Impeachment, and Conservative Values\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) commenced its four-day event on Wednesday, emphasizing an \"America vs. Socialism\" theme that aims to counter the perceived leftward shift within the Democratic Party, particularly its presidential candidates. The annual conservative gathering, held near Washington D.C., will feature speeches from President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a host of conservative figures, all aiming to argue against socialism.\n\nMatt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU) that organizes the event, stated in an exclusive interview that the theme is intended to address the ongoing internal debates within the Democratic Party over big-government policies. The conference, which runs through Saturday, is set to delve into sensitive political territory, as the Democratic primary field grapples with the implications of socialist ideologies, as exemplified by front-runner Bernie Sanders' praise of Cuba's Fidel Castro and his policy proposals.\n\nSchlapp emphasized that the conference will highlight the relevance of conservatism in the current political climate, stating that conservatism values the individual human being and upholds the rights to life, private property, and self-determination. In contrast, he argued, socialists believe in the federal government's entitlement to transform society.\n\nIn addition to socialism, the conference will address the impeachment proceedings against President Trump, with a focus on what Schlapp described as a \"disgusting path\" from 2015 onward to obstruct Trump, lie about him, and attempt a coup against him. The event will feature Republican lawmakers who have supported the president, including Reps. Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Devin Nunes, John Ratcliffe, and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nAs per tradition, the conference will conclude with a straw poll, allowing attendees to assess President Trump's performance. Notably, CPAC 2020 coincides with the South Carolina primary, the last early-state contest before Super Tuesday.",
    " Title: Midterm Elections: A Look at the State of the Parties Ahead of Tuesday's Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, the political landscape in the United States remains divided, with historical trends suggesting a potential loss for the incumbent party. However, a closer look at the performance of both parties reveals a different story.\n\nOn one side, the Republican Party, led by House Speaker Paul Ryan, has managed to deliver two significant legislative accomplishments under President Donald Trump's administration. The individual mandate, a contentious aspect of Obamacare, has been abolished, and Ryan's tax overhaul reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, spurring economic growth.\n\nThe tax cut, combined with Trump's deregulation efforts, has led to strong growth, with consumer spending, capital investment, and exports all on the rise. Unemployment has dropped below 4%, and for the first time on record, job openings exceed the number of unemployed individuals seeking employment. This economic growth is reflected in the third quarter's 3.1% increase in wages and salaries, the highest jump in a decade.\n\nOn the other side, the Democratic Party has faced criticism for their focus on investigations and cultural issues rather than policy. Despite the 2016 election results, the party has not significantly adjusted their agenda, instead pursuing a series of conspiracy theories and championing controversial figures.\n\nThe Senate, controlled by the Republicans, has made significant strides in confirming Trump's judicial nominees, which could offer a rebalancing to the constitutional structure and help lower the temperature in the long term.\n\nIn contrast, the Democratic Party has been accused of undermining the legitimacy of the 2016 election and promoting divisive cultural issues. The party's response to the migrant caravan, for example, has been criticized as weak and out of touch with the concerns of many voters.\n\nIn the end, the midterm elections will determine the balance of power in Congress. While the Democratic Party may have a strong message for some voters, their approach to the 2016 election and their handling of cultural issues have raised concerns for many Americans. The Republican Party, on the other hand, has delivered on key legislative promises, particularly in the economic sphere.\n\nAs the nation prepares for Tuesday's vote, it is crucial to consider the performance of both parties and the impact they have had on the country. The outcome of the midterm elections will shape the direction of the United States for years to come.",
    " Title: The Shift in Political Power: A Critical Examination of Executive Authority in the Modern Era\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed impeachment attempt against President Donald Trump, a critical question arises: Why haven't Democrats seriously considered the reverse - the potential reduction of power from the presidency? Over the past 33 months, the 45th president has been accused of various misconduct, including coordinating with the Kremlin, obstructing the Russia investigation, making controversial comments, and two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\n\nHowever, what has been noticeably absent is a structural critique of the ever-accumulating executive branch power itself. Democrats may dislike Trump's use of authority, but they do not seem to desire less power in the White House, especially when they regain control. In fact, the opposite appears to be true.\n\nDuring his response to Trump's State of the Union address, leading presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) criticized the president for not being punitive enough toward American companies. In her official Democratic Party response, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer focused on the executive actions taken by Democratic governors in defiance of their legislatures, rather than Trump's perceived monarchical gestures during the speech.\n\nThe Democratic presidential field, with the notable exception of faltering front-runner Joe Biden, has been engaged in a race to see who can make the most elaborate promises of immediate executive action. The focus has shifted from 100 days to 100 hours, demonstrating a desire for swift action through executive orders rather than collaborative legislation.\n\nOn Day One, President Elizabeth Warren would wipe out student loans for 42 million people, ban fracking \"everywhere,\" and block any future fossil fuel leases on public lands and offshore. Presidential hopeful Sanders' Day One list includes an executive order to \"legalize marijuana in every state in this country.\"\n\nWhile legalizing marijuana is a commendable and long-overdue idea, Sanders' method of achieving it is problematic. Federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act, is constitutionally required to originate from or be struck down by either Congress or constitutional amendment. A presidency with enough power to legalize Activity X irrespective of Congress or the desires of states is a presidency with enough power to criminalize that same activity when the other team wins. This seesaw of authoritarianism should be a concern for all.\n\nComparing the personal response to Trump's imperial actions with the structural reaction against President Nixon's reveals a stark contrast. In the wake of Watergate, Democrats (and some Republicans) embarked on a mission to prune back the runaway executive branch. The 1973 War Powers Resolution, the 1974 Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, the 1974 upgrade of the Freedom of Information Act, and the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act were all enacted to reassert the legislative branch's authority and prevent governments from hiding their activities.\n\nThe 99% partisan impeachment process in both chambers of Congress and the Democratic presidential field's will to executive power are causes for concern for those who yearn for an independent legislature. If America is to break free from the populist seesaw, we will need to root less for politicians and more for the rules and mores that can restrain them.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Discussions on Immigration Reform: Schumer, Ryan, and Gowdy Engage in Cross-Party Talks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer has been holding private talks on immigration with Republican Reps. Paul Ryan and Trey Gowdy. These discussions, which have not been disclosed until now, are part of a broader effort by key House Republicans to reach a deal with Democrats on immigration reform.\n\nThe talks, while not formal negotiations, provide a glimpse into the urgency and high stakes surrounding the immigration reform debate. The discussions, however, have not led to any agreement on contentious issues such as a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11.7 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.\n\nSen. Schumer, who led immigration negotiations in the Senate in 2013, approached Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, and the pair have met four times since then, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the talks. The discussions, which have encompassed various topics, including ice fishing and Asian carp, have immigration reform high on the agenda.\n\nIn a statement, Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert confirmed the meetings, stating, \"In 2013, Sen. Schumer reached out and Congressman Ryan agreed to talk with him. They discussed a number of issues, but with respect to immigration reform, Congressman Ryan made clear to Sen. Schumer that we\u2019re doing things differently in the House.\"\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican and chair of the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, has also met with Schumer. Gowdy, a respected figure on the right, has the ear of a broad swath of conservatives. Gowdy's office did not respond to an email regarding his discussions with Schumer.\n\nIn a statement, Gowdy spokeswoman Amanda Infield Duvall said, \"Congressman Gowdy has met with people of all political persuasions on immigration. He meets with people all the time on the issue.\"\n\nSchumer's office declined to comment on the talks with Ryan and Gowdy. A source close to the issue stated, \"Sen. Schumer and Rep. Ryan did not negotiate any specifics of House legislation at all in these meetings.\"\n\nThe White House is also closely monitoring the developments in the House regarding immigration reform, with administration officials quietly taking the temperature of House Republicans. Katie Beirne Fallon, the president's new legislative affairs director, discussed immigration with top aides and lawmakers in Republican leadership during her first rounds on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe lack of substantive, across-the-aisle discussions has been a concern for many, with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) expressing doubts about the prospects of a bill passing in 2014. \"The biggest impediment to making progress on immigration that I\u2019ve seen over the last year... is a complete lack of confidence that the law will be applied, that the enforcement measures will happen,\" Rubio said on Monday. \"And I think that\u2019s only been exacerbated by the actions the president and this administration have taken over the last year.\"\n\nThese cross-party and cross-chamber talks, despite their limited scope, demonstrate a commitment by leading figures in both parties to find common ground. However, it remains unclear whether these quiet discussions will lead to a breakthrough.",
    " Title: \"Confederate Statues Vandalized Across Southern States: A Call for Peaceful Protest and Respect for Public Property\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of events that have swept across several southern states, Confederate monuments have been defaced, toppled, or vandalized in the past week. The latest incident occurred in Birmingham, Alabama, where a statue of Confederate officer Charles Linn was defaced and removed from a public park on Sunday evening. This follows similar incidents in other states, including the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Birmingham, a statue of General Robert E. Lee in Richmond, Virginia, and Confederate statues in North and South Carolina.\n\nThe destruction of these monuments is part of a wave of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd. While some argue that the removal of these symbols of the Confederacy will alleviate racial tensions, others contend that they are symbols of state heritage. The protesters' actions, however, have raised questions about the appropriateness of using violence and property destruction as a means of protest.\n\nThe deliberate destruction of public property is not only illegal but also goes against the Lockean idea that property, both private and public, is sacred. Vandalizing property is a rejection of a fundamental principle of the American system and a disregard for the rule of law, which is toxic to the health of any republic.\n\nIn a civil society, citizens have the freedom to use their vote to change the government's decisions, but they also agree to submit to the state's judgment, even when they believe it to be in error. By vandalizing these statues, some protesters have shown that they are willing to break the law to prove their dissent. This spurning of the rule of law is harmful to the health of any republic and, if unchecked, could lead to further unforeseen consequences.\n\nHistory has shown that revolutions that disregard basic rights to life and property can lead to chaos and devastating consequences. The French Revolution and the subsequent Reign of Terror serve as grim reminders that going beyond the law to address grievances can upset a nation's social and political order.\n\nAs citizens, we must remember that property, public and private, must be protected. If these Confederate statues are indeed causing discord, they should be removed in a manner determined by law. However, the wanton defacement and destruction of public property witnessed this week are as inexcusable as they are unlawful and unethical, and such vandalism must not be permitted to continue.",
    " Title: \"A Call for Unity: Condemning Extremism on Both Sides of the Political Spectrum\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the tumultuous year of 2017, the political landscape of America was marred by incidents that challenged the nation's collective values and tested the resilience of its institutions. This was a year when reason seemed to take a backseat to unreason, as political tribalism overshadowed human decency.\n\nThe tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia, marked a turning point, not only for the loss of a young woman's life but also for the distortion of our political culture. The President's response to the white supremacist rally, where he referred to some participants as \"very fine people,\" sparked widespread controversy and concern.\n\nHowever, it was not just the far-right that drew criticism. Some on the left-wing spectrum, in their response to the far-right, found themselves aligning with violent extremists. The rise of Antifa, a far-left-leaning anti-fascist movement, and the support it received from certain quarters, led to a comparison with American heroes who stormed Omaha Beach.\n\nIn a series of tweets that have since aged poorly, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, expressed his concerns about the actions of Antifa and its supporters. He questioned whether any gathering of Trump supporters, regardless of their political affiliations, risked a violent response in blue enclaves, and whether authorities had ceded control of the streets to a Marxist/anarchist mob.\n\nGoldberg's sentiments echo those of David French, a senior writer for \u2588\u2588\u2588 and a senior fellow at the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Institute, who also condemned the actions of Antifa. French argued that Antifa and its elite apologists were sending a message of hate and loathing to millions of Americans, and that they were competing with the alt-right for control of the political sewer.\n\nIn the face of such extremism, it is crucial to uphold the values of unity, human decency, and the rule of law. Condemning violence and extremism, whether it comes from the far-right or the far-left, is essential for the preservation of a peaceful and democratic society. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that we do not lose our way in the pursuit of justice and equality.",
    " Title: President Trump to Attend March for Life, First President to Do So in Event's History\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced his plans to attend the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C. on Friday. The event, themed \"Life Empowers: Pro-Life is Pro-Woman,\" is an annual anti-abortion rally that attracts thousands of participants.\n\nTrump's attendance will make him the first president to attend the march, according to Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life. In 2018, Trump became the first president to speak at the march via video feed.\n\nThe administration has consistently worked to regulate or restrict abortion access since Trump took office. The President's expected attendance at the march comes after his return from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and as the Senate impeachment trial into his conduct regarding Ukraine is underway.\n\nMancini expressed excitement about Trump's visit, stating, \"He will be the first president in history to attend and we are so excited for him to experience in person how passionate our marchers are about life and protecting the unborn.\" A press release for the march states that Trump will speak at the event.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, and GOP Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey are also scheduled to speak at the march.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, described Trump's presence at the March for Life as a \"watershed moment for the Pro-life Movement.\" Dannenfelser previously served as the national chairwoman of the 2016 Trump campaign's Pro-life Coalition.\n\nAbortion rights activists criticized Trump's announcement, with NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue calling it \"an act of desperation.\" Hogue accused Trump of \"turning to deception and disinformation about abortion to gin up a vocal and extreme minority as he faces the escalating reality that his presidency is crumbling around him.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund, the political arm of the nonprofit reproductive health care organization, tweeted that \"since day one, the Trump-Pence administration has sought to undermine our access to health care, including safe, legal abortion.\" The group added, \"But the 77% of us who support that access will have our say in November. Let's make sure that next year, he's there as a private citizen.\"",
    " Title: House and Senate Face Impasse Over Government Funding and Obamacare Defunding\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives could vote as early as this week on a short-term spending bill to avert a government shutdown, while simultaneously attempting to defund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. However, the Senate is unlikely to support any proposal that does not fund the health care law, increasing the possibility of a government shutdown.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and other top House Republican leaders have been grappling with the challenge of avoiding a showdown over the health care law, spearheaded by President Barack Obama, and funding legislation that needs approval before the end of the fiscal year on September 30 to prevent a shutdown.\n\nLast week, a significant number of House Republicans threatened to defeat the stop-gap measure because it did not directly link continued government funding with a ban on money for the new health care law. This reversal demonstrates the continued inability of Boehner to rally hard-line conservatives who insist the spending bill prohibit all Obamacare funding.\n\nNo decisions have been made, or will be made, until House Republican members meet and discuss the issue tomorrow, according to Michael Steel, Boehner's spokesman. House Republicans are scheduled to discuss the next steps on a vote on the \"continuing resolution\" Wednesday morning, with a Friday vote on a measure to fund the government through mid-December being the target.\n\nHowever, the measure is unlikely to go far in the Senate, as majority Democrats have made it clear that any attempt to defund the new health care law is a non-starter. A senior House GOP aide expects Senate Democrats to strip the Obamacare defunding language and potentially send the spending bill back to the House with other changes.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid invoked Albert Einstein's definition of insanity when referring to House Republicans on Tuesday, accusing them of doing the same thing over and over\u2014trying to defund Obamacare\u2014and expecting a different result.\n\nAnother idea gaining traction, which is likely to be brought up as this fight plays out, is attaching a one-year delay of Obamacare to legislation that would raise the nation's borrowing authority.\n\nPresident Obama, in a statement on Monday, criticized the Republican strategy, stating, \"You have some Republicans in the House of Representatives who are promising to shut down the government at the end of the month if they can't shut down the Affordable Care Act. And if that scheme does not work, some have suggested they won't pay the very bills that Congress has run up, which would cause America to default on its debt for the first time in its history.\"\n\nAs the deadline for the end of the fiscal year approaches, the situation remains uncertain, with some Republican representatives, such as Louisiana's John Fleming and Steve Scalise, advocating for attaching a full delay of Obamacare for a year to the debt ceiling increase. The debate continues, and the outcome remains to be seen.",
    " Title: North Korea's Economic Focus Amid Tensions: A Shift in Rhetoric and Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea, in the midst of ongoing regional tensions with both the United States and South Korea, has begun its annual spring parliamentary session. In a surprising turn of events, the ruling party has declared a stronger economy as a top priority, alongside the expansion of its nuclear arsenal. This shift in rhetoric, as reported by The Associated Press, suggests a more balanced approach towards economic development and nuclear development.\n\nRecent weeks have seen North Korea issuing threats against the United States and South Korea, including plans to \"cut off\" hotlines with the South and to launch military strikes against the US mainland. The regime has also reaffirmed its commitment to its nuclear weapons, stating it will never relinquish them under any circumstances. However, the parliamentary focus on economic reform indicates that North Korea may not be as consumed by its own paranoia as its propaganda suggests.\n\nThe North has not yet followed through on its threat to close the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a site inside North Korea where South Korean companies and managers oversee manufacturing performed by North Korean workers. The complex remained open on Monday, despite Pyongyang's threat on Saturday to shut it down unless South Korea stops \"damaging our dignity.\"\n\nThe Kaesong Industrial Complex is a critical lifeline for the North. If closed, the regime would lose some $87 million a year in wages from the 54,000 North Korean workers there. A worker makes an average of $134 a month, but most of this goes directly into the regime's coffers. The closure would also heavily impact the families of North Korean workers and residents in Kaesong and surrounding areas.\n\nMeanwhile, both the US and South Korea have been showing signs of increased military strength in the region. South Korean President Park Geun-hye has stated that if any provocations occur, the response should be swift and powerful, without any political considerations. The South has also changed its military policies to allow for a quicker and more retributive response to North Korean aggression.\n\nThe US has sent a squadron of F-22 fighters to the region, and in recent weeks, the US Air Force has flown \"Eisenhower-era B-52s,\" \"Reagan-era B-2s,\" and \"George W. Bush-era F-22s\" over the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThis development comes as both the US and South Korea continue to engage in joint military exercises in the region, which have prompted strong protests from the North. The ongoing tensions and military maneuvers serve as a reminder of the delicate balance of power in the region and the potential for conflict.",
    " Title: Trump Narrows Secretary of State Pick to ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly zeroing in on ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his nominee for secretary of State. Tillerson had a second interview with the president-elect on Saturday at Trump Tower, and has emerged as the favorite in the long-running competition to lead the State Department, according to a person familiar with the transition deliberations who spoke to media outlets on condition of anonymity because Trump has yet to announce his pick.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Trump praised Tillerson, saying, \"He's in charge of an oil company that's pretty much double the size of his next nearest competitor. It\u2019s been a company that's been unbelievably managed.\" Trump also highlighted Tillerson's extensive experience in dealing with world leaders, particularly in Russia, where Tillerson has negotiated numerous deals for the oil company.\n\nHowever, Tillerson's ties to Russia and his personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin are likely to draw scrutiny, especially given the ongoing allegations of Russian interference in the recent U.S. election. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) told CNN that he has concerns about Tillerson's relationship with Putin, and that the issue will be examined during Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nTrump's search for a secretary of State has included multiple interviews with other candidates, including Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, Bob Corker, and David Petraeus. Giuliani, who withdrew from the competition on Friday, accompanied Trump to the Army-Navy game on Saturday.\n\nTillerson, who has no previous governmental or diplomatic experience, has worked for Exxon since graduating from college with an engineering degree in 1975. As CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson has negotiated with countries all over the world for oil exploration rights, particularly in the Middle East and Russia.\n\nOf particular interest in his Senate confirmation hearings would be the $2.2 billion Exxon investment in Russian oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean, which Tillerson negotiated in 2011. That agreement, which also allowed Russian investment in other Exxon ventures around the world, was eventually scuttled after U.S.-imposed sanctions following Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\nTillerson has been critical of international sanctions, saying they're difficult to impose fairly. He has acknowledged that climate change has been caused by human activity, and has endorsed a carbon tax as \"the most efficient means of reflecting the cost of carbon in all economic decisions.\" However, environmental groups are expected to oppose his Senate confirmation if he's nominated.\n\nThe secretary of State is also responsible for advancing U.S. policy on human rights. Tillerson, himself an Eagle Scout, was president of the Boy Scouts of America at the time when it began allowing gay scouts, and in 2015 ExxonMobil changed its anti-discrimination policy to include gays and lesbians. However, the Human Rights Campaign remains skeptical of the company's policy, saying it was prompted by Obama's 2014 executive order targeting federal contractors, not a change in corporate values.",
    " Title: Stark Divisions Emerge in American Identity as Democrats and Republicans Disagree on Essential Qualities of U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nA new survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has revealed a deep divide in the American public's perception of the country's identity, with Republicans and Democrats holding starkly different views on what constitutes the essence of American identity.\n\nWhile there is a shared belief among 7 in 10 people, regardless of party, that the U.S. is losing its identity, the survey found significant differences in the characteristics that Democrats and Republicans view as inherent to American identity.\n\nLynele Jones, a 65-year-old accountant from Boulder, Colorado, and a Democrat, pointed to diversity and openness to refugees and other immigrants as central components of being American. On the other hand, Reggie Lawrence, a 44-year-old Republican from Midland, Texas, who runs a business servicing oil fields, emphasized the role of Christian values and the Constitution in shaping the country's identity.\n\nThe survey found that about 65 percent of Democrats considered a mix of global cultures as extremely or very important to American identity, compared with 35 percent of Republicans. Conversely, 29 percent of Democrats saw Christianity as that important, compared with 57 percent of Republicans.\n\nDemocrats are also far more likely than Republicans to view the ability of people to come to the U.S. to escape violence and persecution as very important, with 74 percent of Democrats expressing this view compared to 55 percent of Republicans.\n\nRegarding the country's early European immigrants, 25 percent of Democrats considered their culture very important, versus 46 percent of Republicans.\n\nThe poll also found that Democrats were nearly three times as likely as Republicans to view the U.S. as a country made up of many cultures and values that change as new people arrive, with far more Republicans favoring an essential American culture that immigrants should adopt.\n\nRepublicans overwhelmingly viewed immigrants who arrived in the past decade as having retained their own cultures and values rather than adopting American ones.\n\nThe survey also revealed that Democrats coalesce around a fear of the country's political leaders, political polarization, and economic inequality, while most Republicans point instead to illegal immigration as a top concern.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,004 adults was conducted from February 16-20, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.",
    " Title: Critique of Obama's Unilateral Reversal of U.S.-Cuba Policy: A Look Beyond the Headlines\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent announcement by President Obama regarding the unilateral reversal of U.S.-Cuba policy has sparked a heated debate, with critics arguing that the move is based on a flawed premise. The argument posits that engagement with authoritarian regimes like Cuba will not lead to democratic change.\n\nThe deal, as it stands, does not hold the Castro regime accountable for its human rights abuses and lacks commitments to democratic principles. Instead, it appears to have granted Raul Castro's regime all the concessions it sought, while the White House has failed to secure any significant concessions in return.\n\nThe deal's most controversial aspect is the swap of American citizen Alan Gross for the Cuban Five spies. Gross, who was arrested in 2009, was essentially a hostage, while the Cuban Five, who were convicted spies, received due process, including trial by jury. The administration's decision to commute the sentences of three convicted spies in exchange for Gross's release has been criticized for undermining justice for the families of the slain Brothers to the Rescue heroes, who were American citizens and a U.S. resident.\n\nMoreover, the deal has been met with disapproval from leaders of pro-democracy efforts in Cuba. Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, also known as \"Antunez,\" the leader of the largest resistance coalition in Cuba, stated that the deal is a betrayal that leaves the democratic opposition defenseless.\n\nThe deal's impact on the freedom-loving people of Cuba is a significant concern. The increased tourism promoted by the administration will likely serve as a propaganda coup for the Castro regime, especially at a time when the regime is struggling economically due to its ties with Venezuela and Russia.\n\nThe administration's actions have been criticized for failing to uphold democratic values and for setting a dangerous precedent that could embolden other authoritarian regimes. As the world's lone superpower, it is the U.S.'s role to promote democracy and freedom, not just where it is convenient for the president's legacy.\n\nIleana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Florida and chairman of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, has been vocal in her criticism of the policy. The legislative branch now has a role to play in opposing this overreach of executive action and reaffirming the need to continue defending freedom and democracy worldwide.",
    " Title: Unannounced Meeting Between Jared Kushner and Saudi Crown Prince Raises Questions Over Classified Information Sharing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn late October, Jared Kushner, senior advisor to President Donald Trump, made an unannounced trip to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, causing some intelligence officials to be taken aback. According to reports, Kushner and the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, discussing and strategizing.\n\nFollowing this meeting, MBS reportedly told confidants that Kushner had discussed the names of Saudis disloyal to the crown prince. Kushner, through his attorney's spokesperson, has denied this claim.\n\nJust a week after Kushner's return to the U.S., MBS launched an anti-corruption crackdown, arresting dozens of members of the Saudi royal family and imprisoning them in the Ritz-Carlton Riyadh. Several figures named in the President's Daily Brief were among those rounded up, with at least one reportedly being tortured.\n\nNow, Congressional Democrats have asked FBI Director Christopher Wray to investigate whether Jared Kushner leaked classified information from the Presidential Daily Brief to the crown prince. In a letter to Wray, Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu, Gerald Connolly, Donald Beyer, Pramila Jayapal, Peter Welch, and Ruben Gallego requested an immediate investigation to determine if these reports are accurate and to explore the extent to which information and sources may have been compromised.\n\nThe letter notes that the \"integrity of classified information\" falls within the purview of the FBI, but that \"while the President has the authority to declassify and share information, the President's advisers do not.\" If Kushner discussed names with MBS without presidential authorization, he may have violated federal laws around the sharing of classified intelligence.\n\nThe Intercept also reported that after the meeting, MBS bragged to the UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and others that Kushner was \"in his pocket.\" Access to the President's Daily Brief is tightly guarded, but Trump has the legal authority to allow Kushner to disclose information contained in it. If Kushner discussed names with MBS as an approved tactic of U.S. foreign policy, the move would be a striking intervention by the U.S. into an unfolding power struggle at the top levels of an allied nation.\n\nIt is important to note that only months before this meeting, Jared Kushner sought a $500 million loan from officials in Qatar for a troubled New York City real estate project. This has led to speculation that Kushner may have been trading classified information for his own financial benefit, as Kushner has been seeking financing from around the world.\n\nThe FBI's investigation into these matters is crucial to ensure the integrity of classified information and to maintain the trust between the U.S. and its allies.",
    " Title: Texas Governor Abbott Clarifies Constitutionality of New Sanctuary City Law, Rebuts Critics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has clarified the constitutionality of the recently signed bill that outlaws sanctuary jurisdictions in the state. The new law, which creates civil and criminal penalties for those who refuse to cooperate with immigration officials, has been met with criticism from Democrat legislators and left-of-center Texas news outlets.\n\nGovernor Abbott addressed the concerns about the constitutionality of a provision in the law allowing police officers to inquire about the immigration status of someone they have detained. In response to claims that the law is unconstitutional due to states being pre-empted by federal law in the area of immigration, Abbott stated that the Supreme Court's ruling on the Arizona immigration law does not apply to the Texas law.\n\n\"The so-called controversial part of this law is what some label as the'show your papers' component,\" Abbott explained. \"And what everyone seems to get wrong is they think that that provision was stricken down in the Arizona law. To the contrary, the provision in the Arizona law is stricter than the Texas law. The Arizona law required that law enforcement ask for papers. The Texas law does not require it, it allows it, so there is that one difference.\"\n\nAbbott also reassured American citizens living in Texas that the bill does nothing to change their daily lives. \"For American citizens, this bill has no impact on them whatsoever, and they have absolutely nothing to be concerned about,\" Abbott said. \"There's only one group of people that is targeted by this legislation and that is people who are in this country illegally, who have committed violent crimes, and are subject to an ICE detainer request.\"\n\nThe law's author, Senator Charles Perry (R-Lubbock), confirmed that police can already inquire about the immigration status of a person they detain, and that the bill does not change anything in this regard. He also stated that citizens and legal residents do not need to carry papers to prove they are here legally.\n\nThe new law poses a threat to law enforcement officials who choose to ignore detainer requests on illegal immigrants in their jails from immigration officials. \"All law enforcement officers are going to be required to follow this law,\" Abbott stated. \"If they refuse to follow this law, or if they adopt sanctuary city policies, they are subject now to the stiffest penalties in America for adopting sanctuary city policies \u2013 which includes jail time where sheriffs could wind up in the same jail they may be releasing inmates from who are the subject of ICE detainer requests.\"\n\nGovernor Abbott believes this law will make Texas a safer place and help avoid tragedies like the murder of Kate Steinle by a previously deported illegal alien released from the local jail in a sanctuary city. \"This law makes Texans safer because it prevents the types of policies that California has that lead to the tragic murder of Kate Steinle,\" Abbott said. \"It prevents the types of policies that were adopted by the Travis County sheriff who had policies that release back out on the street, people who are either accused of, or even convicted of, very dangerous crimes.\"\n\nThe new sanctuary city law goes into effect on September 1, 2017.",
    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie Stresses Balance in Vaccination Policies Amid Measles Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a recent trip to the United Kingdom, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie emphasized the need for a balanced approach in addressing parental concerns over vaccinations as the U.S. grapples with a resurgence of measles.\n\nIn response to a question about whether he would advocate for vaccinations in the U.S., Mr. Christie stated, \"We vaccinate ours, and so, you know that's the best expression I can give you of my opinion.\" He further added, \"You know it's much more important what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official. That's what we do. But I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that's the balance that the government has to decide.\"\n\nWhen asked if he believes some vaccines are dangerous, Mr. Christie clarified that he did not make such a statement. \"I said different disease types can be more lethal, so that the concern would be measuring whatever the perceived danger is by vaccine and we've had plenty of that over a period of time versus what the risk to public health is. You have to have that balance, and that's exactly what I mean by what I said,\" he explained.\n\nHis office later issued a clarification on the remarks, stating that Mr. Christie believes vaccines are an essential public health protection. Regarding measles, there is \"no question\" children should be vaccinated, according to the clarification. However, different states have varying vaccination requirements, which is why Mr. Christie called for a balanced approach in determining which vaccinations should be mandated by the government.\n\nIn a separate interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie, President Obama advised parents to get their children vaccinated, stating that measles is \"preventable\" and that the science supporting vaccines is \"pretty indisputable.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Support for Intelligence Community as Trump-Russia Allegations Persist\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare display of bipartisan unity, the two top Republicans in Congress offered strong support for the intelligence community on Monday, in stark contrast to President-elect Donald Trump's criticism of the CIA following reports that the agency found the Russian government had attempted to help him win the presidency.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) expressed his \"highest confidence\" in the intelligence agencies, while House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) praised them for their diligent efforts in addressing cyber threats from foreign governments. Both leaders, however, cautioned against using the issue for partisan gain or casting doubt on the outcome of the election.\n\nMcConnell singled out the Central Intelligence Agency for praise and announced that the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees would investigate findings by intelligence agencies that Russia hacked into emails and computers used in the presidential campaign.\n\n\"Any foreign breach of our cybersecurity measures is disturbing, and I strongly condemn any such efforts,\" McConnell told reporters. He later added, \"The Russians are not our friends.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Friday that the CIA has informed senators that Russian President Vladimir Putin's government was actively seeking to help Trump win the election, a step beyond an earlier finding that the goal was to undermine the credibility of the U.S. political process.\n\n\"Any intervention by Russia is especially problematic because, under President Putin, Russia has been an aggressor that consistently undermines American interests,\" Ryan said in a statement on Monday. \"As we work to protect our democracy from foreign influence, we should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama explained his reasons for ordering a full review of the evidence of Russian hacking in an appearance on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show With Trevor Noah\" on Monday night.\n\n\"The reason that I called for a review is really to just gather all the threads of the investigations, the intelligence work that has been done over many months, and put it in a single document that can be shared with members of Congress, relevant intelligence agencies, that can be shared with the transition team so that they understand what exactly happened and so that the public and our elected representatives going forward can find ways to prevent this kind of interference from having an impact on elections in the future,\" Obama said, according to excerpts released by Comedy Central.\n\nTrump's team has attacked the CIA for its findings and questioned the agency's credibility, citing faulty intelligence analysis that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Trump tweeted on Monday, \"Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!\"\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller did not comment directly on McConnell's remarks when asked by reporters on a conference call on Monday, but criticized the reports about the CIA's findings.\n\n\"What this is is an attempt to try to de-legitimize President-elect Trump's win,\" Miller said. \"That really seems to be what's going on here.\"\n\nThe White House defended the intelligence community on Monday, with press secretary Josh Earnest saying that spy agencies are staffed by \"patriots.\"\n\n\"President Obama has benefited enormously from their work, their expertise, their advice, and their service to the country,\" Earnest told reporters. \"I'm confident the president-elect would benefit from that advice if he remains open to it.\"\n\nSenate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-AZ) and the incoming Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said on Sunday in an unusual joint statement that the Senate would investigate Russia's interference in the presidential election.\n\nA small group of Electoral College members, including Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, on Monday requested a briefing from the intelligence community on the possible scope of Russian interference in the U.S. election. On Dec. 19, the electors meet across the country to formally select the president and vice president.\n\nThe allegations concerning Russia have taken on new significance now that Trump is considering Exxon Mobil Corp. chief Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. Tillerson is known for having ties to Putin, and the oil chief was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship, a high civilian honor given to distinguished foreign nationals. As recently as 2015, he visited with officials in Putin's inner circle.\n\nIf Trump does nominate Tillerson, the Russian allegations could pose problems for his Senate confirmation, even for some Republicans.\n\n\"I don't know the man much at all, but let's put it this way: If you received an Order of Friendship award from Putin -- then we'll have some questions,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said in a statement over the weekend. \"I don't want to prejudge the guy, but that's a bit unnerving.\"\n\nOn Monday, Schumer made clear that Democrats also would question Tillerson's Russian ties.\n\n\"Every one of these nominees, and particularly a guy like Tillerson, needs a thorough, thorough hearing,\" Schumer said on CBS. \"He'll be questioned thoroughly should he be the nominee, and all of these allegations and talks about his closeness with Putin will come forward.\"\n\nMcConnell declined to comment on the potential nomination of Tillerson, saying he wouldn't discuss a \"phantom nominee.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Seeks to Learn from Past Mistakes as He Faces Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Obama prepares for a series of challenging talks on the debt ceiling and the impending fiscal cliff, the stakes are high. Lawmakers have until Dec. 31 to reach a deal to prevent $700 billion in federal budget cuts, a move that could almost certainly trigger a recession and set the tone for the beginning of Obama's second term.\n\nObama is reportedly approaching these talks with a newfound determination, aiming to rewrite history after the contentious debt ceiling talks in 2011. NPR's Mara Liasson told Guy Raz, host of weekends on All Things Considered, that the president is bringing lessons from those failed talks to the table.\n\n\"He's starting out with some clear bottom lines [and] he's not making concessions upfront the way he did with the stimulus package,\" Liasson said. \"I think the president is getting a do-over, and also he's in a stronger position now.\"\n\nThe fiscal cliff negotiations will be a significant part of Obama's legacy, a legacy that every president begins to consider. In fact, during his first three years in office, Obama hosted small dinners at the White House, inviting noted presidential historians such as Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robert Caro, Michael Beschloss, and Robert Dallek.\n\nAccording to Jodi Kantor, who reported on these dinners for The New York Times, the purpose of these gatherings was not merely for historical discussion. Instead, the president sought historical perspective to inform his strategy and learn from the mistakes and triumphs of his predecessors.\n\nThe historians primarily focused on transformative presidents like Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan. During the third dinner, historian H.W. Brands suggested that President Roosevelt might be a better model for Obama's presidency.\n\nBrands told Raz that Roosevelt was able to push the country and the government in a progressive direction while presiding over 7 1/2 years of peace and prosperity. Roosevelt also dealt with a hostile Congress, and, despite being a Republican, he supported universal health care.\n\nThe historians were honest with Obama, telling him that there was one quality they wished he shared more with Theodore Roosevelt: a stronger relationship with the American people. The president took this advice to heart, and a few months later, when laying out his vision for a second term in Osawatomie, Kansas, the president quoted from Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nAs Obama faces the fiscal cliff negotiations, he may find himself channeling some of that inner Roosevelt, as he negotiates with many of the same people in Congress as he did in 2011. The difference this time is the legacy he, and those in the debt talks, will leave behind.",
    " Title: AOC Defends Campaign Activities Amidst Allegations of Election Law Violation\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has come under scrutiny for her campaign activities, with her primary challenger, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, accusing her of violating election law. The allegations stem from a graduation party AOC hosted over the weekend, which was held next to an early voting site.\n\nIn an interview with The Post, Ocasio-Cortez clarified her stance on debates, stating, \"The good thing is I'm not skipping debates. My predecessor, he had skipped debates until he was forced to show up.\" The congresswoman is referring to her predecessor, Joe Crowley, who infamously skipped a debate in 2018, leading to his eventual defeat.\n\nHowever, Ocasio-Cortez has opted for virtual debates due to concerns over social distancing rules. She cited the ongoing phase one and phase two reopening guidelines issued by Governor Andrew Cuomo as the reason for this decision. The congresswoman has already participated in two online debates with her primary challengers, including one on May 18.\n\nThe Parkchester Times-sponsored debate, the same one Crowley shirked in 2018, is the one Ocasio-Cortez is currently avoiding due to social distancing concerns. Despite this, the congresswoman has been active in other group events, such as handing out masks to George Floyd protesters in Queens on June 2 and hosting a socially distanced graduation party in a church parking lot on Sunday.\n\nCaruso-Cabrera, Ocasio-Cortez's well-funded challenger, has criticized the freshman rep for the alleged election law violation. \"AOC directly violated the election law. She doesn't pay her taxes. She said yes to a salary increase. Who wants this type of person in Congress when we're all in trouble?\" Caruso-Cabrera's spokesman, Hank Sheinkopf, told The Post.\n\nA representative for Ocasio-Cortez did not return a request for comment on the alleged violation. The congresswoman's campaign activities continue to be a topic of discussion as the primary election approaches.",
    " Title: Google Employees Urge Cancellation of Military AI Project, Citing Ethical Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThousands of Google employees have signed an open letter urging the tech giant to cease work on a military project involving the use of artificial intelligence to improve the precision of drone strikes. The project, known as Project Maven, has sparked controversy among Google's workforce, with employees expressing concerns about the company's involvement in warfare technology.\n\nThe letter, addressed to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, calls for the cancellation of Project Maven and the establishment of a clear policy prohibiting Google from developing warfare technology. The letter, which has been signed by 3,100 employees, including \"dozens of senior engineers,\" according to the New York Times, states that staff have already raised concerns with senior management internally. Google employs over 88,000 people worldwide.\n\nThe letter argues that Google should not be involved in warfare, stating, \"We believe that Google should not be in the business of war.\" The employees contend that the company's involvement in Project Maven puts users' trust at risk and ignores Google's \"moral and ethical responsibility.\"\n\n\"We cannot outsource the moral responsibility of our technologies to third parties,\" the letter states. \"Google's stated values make this clear: every one of our users is trusting us. Never jeopardize that. Ever.\"\n\nThe letter further argues that using Google's technology for military surveillance and potentially lethal outcomes is unacceptable. Google confirmed in March that it was allowing the Pentagon to use some of its image recognition technologies as part of a military project, following an investigative report by tech news site Gizmodo.\n\nIn response to the concerns, Google's cloud business head, Diane Greene, assured employees that the technology would not be used to launch weapons or operate or fly drones. However, the employees who signed the letter feel that the technology's use in military applications still poses ethical dilemmas.\n\nGoogle maintains that Project Maven is for non-offensive purposes and uses open-source object recognition software available to any Google Cloud customer. The models are based on unclassified data only, and the technology is used to flag images for human review, with the intention of saving lives and reducing the need for humans to perform tedious work.\n\nGoogle is currently engaged in a comprehensive discussion about the development and use of its machine learning technologies, and is also seeking input from outside experts as it develops policies for their use. The company's spokesperson stated, \"Any military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns. We're actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic and also with outside experts, as we continue to develop our policies around the development and use of our machine learning technologies.\"",
    " Title: Senate Approves Impeachment Trial Plan for Trump, Setting Stage for Oral Arguments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a late-night session on Tuesday, the U.S. Senate, along party lines, voted 53-47 to approve Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's impeachment trial plan for President Donald Trump. The decision paves the way for oral arguments to commence as early as Wednesday.\n\nThe Senate rejected 10 Democratic amendments to the trial plan by the same margin. An 11th amendment, proposed by Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), aimed at extending the timetable for the prosecution and defense to file trial motions, received one Republican vote but ultimately failed.\n\nAt the core of the trial are charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, which the Democratic-led House approved last month. The charges allege that President Trump abused the power of his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, withholding military aid and a White House meeting as leverage. The president is also accused of concealing his actions from Congress by blocking witness testimony and documents.\n\nPresident Trump's legal team argues that the charges are baseless and equate to criminalizing a president's prerogative to make foreign policy. In a departure from most constitutional scholars, they also claim that the impeachment is unconstitutional because the articles of impeachment do not outline a specific violation of a law.\n\nTuesday's debate primarily revolved around what constitutes a fair trial.\n\n\"This initial step will offer an early signal to our country,\" said Mr. McConnell before the proceedings began. \"Can the Senate still serve our founding purpose?\"\n\nSenator McConnell also experienced a reminder of the inherent unpredictability of the trial, as he was compelled to make last-minute changes to the trial rules under pressure from Republican moderates. The initial rules would have condensed opening arguments by both sides into two 12-hour marathon days. Mr. McConnell's rules also would have refused to admit the findings of the House impeachment inquiry as evidence without a separate vote during the trial.",
    " Title: Graduate Student Workers at Harvard End Strike Despite Lack of Contract Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nBOSTON \u2013 After 29 days of striking, graduate student workers at Harvard University have returned to work on Wednesday, despite the fact that the university and the union have not reached an agreement on a new contract. The strike, which began on December 3, marked the first strike of graduate students on the Ivy League campus since 1973.\n\nThe union, the Harvard Grad Students Union-UAW, has hailed the strike as a victory, pointing to agreements reached in negotiations and a statement from Harvard on December 19 that named the end of January as a possibility for finalizing a contract. In an email to supporters on Monday, members of the bargaining committee vowed to \"hold them accountable to this stated goal.\"\n\nThe decision to call off the strike came after the union agreed to let federal mediators assist in negotiations. The school's spring semester begins this month.\n\nThe graduate students, who include teaching assistants, teaching fellows, tutors, and researchers, are seeking a $25-an-hour minimum wage, expanded health care benefits, and new employment protections.\n\nHarvard has not set a deadline for finalizing a contract, and similar contracts at other universities can take 12 to 18 months to complete. The union has singled out a statement from Harvard Provost Alan Garber that finalizing a contract is \"something that we hope can be resolved in the month ahead.\"\n\nThe strike resulted in six tentative agreements on different parts of the contract, along with others reached before the work stoppage. Harvard has committed to begin mediation for the full contract on Tuesday.\n\nThe union has sought a collective bargaining agreement with several guarantees that have proven to be sticking points during negotiations, including a $25 minimum wage for hourly workers, expanded health care benefits, and stronger protections against sexual harassment and discrimination with a new third-party arbitration process for complaints.\n\nThe university has proposed compensation changes that would include 8.2% raises over three years for research assistants and 7.2% for teaching fellows, in addition to a $17 per hour minimum wage for instructional work. The current rate is $12 per hour.\n\nThe graduate student union has drawn support from Democratic politicians, including presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, as well as Massachusetts U.S. Reps. Ayanna Pressley, Kathleen Clark, and Joe Kennedy III, who joined the picket line last month in a show of solidarity.",

The transcript of this call contrasts starkly with their subsequent call on July 25, during which President Trump asked President Zelensky to investigate matters related to the 2016 election and the Biden family.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham stated that the president \"took the unprecedented steps to declassify and release the transcripts of both of his phone calls with President Zelensky so that every American can see he did nothing wrong.\" The transcript was read in full by Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, during the second public impeachment hearing on Friday.\n\nIn the April call, President Trump extended an invitation to President Zelensky to visit the White House, to which the Ukrainian leader accepted. President Trump also invited President Zelensky to attend his inauguration, with both leaders expressing anticipation for their future meetings.\n\nThis release of the transcript comes amidst the ongoing impeachment inquiry, with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff expressing gratitude for the transcript's release but urging the Trump administration to provide the rest of the requested documents throughout the inquiry.",
    " Title: FBI Acquires Hillary Clinton's Email Server, Server Reportedly Found Empty\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a development that has been the focus of discussions all week, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has complied with the FBI's request to hand over her personal email server, which she used during her tenure as Secretary of State. Earlier this week, it was revealed that Clinton had at least two emails containing classified, top-secret information on her server. It is important to note that the server was not secure and it is illegal to send or receive classified information on a private email account or server.\n\nYesterday, the FBI took possession of Clinton's server from a private data center in New Jersey. Barbara Wells, an attorney for Denver-based computer services firm Platte River Networks, confirmed to The Washington Post that the server \"was blank\" and no longer contained useful information. According to Wells, the information had been migrated over to a different server for purposes of transition. She added that the company had cooperated with the FBI and had been told it was not a target of the investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department is investigating whether classified information was improperly stored on or passed through the server, which Clinton used for all her correspondence during her time as Secretary of State. In March, a defiant Clinton declared that the private server would never be turned over because it contained personal emails between herself and her husband Bill Clinton, in addition to details about her daughter's wedding.\n\nThe revelation that the server is now empty raises questions about the integrity and transparency of Clinton's handling of official government business. The FBI's investigation is ongoing, and it remains to be seen what, if any, further information will be uncovered.",
    " Title: House GOP Report Questions Hillary Clinton's Awareness of Security Issues in Benghazi Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a new report released on Friday, House Republicans have accused former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton of being aware of security problems in Libya prior to the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi. The report also questions the validity of the State Department's own internal review, known as the Accountability Review Board (ARB), stating it had serious deficiencies.\n\nThe report suggests that Clinton should have been held accountable for the security breaches that led to the deaths of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya. The report concludes that systemic failures during Clinton's tenure at the State Department resulted in a grossly inadequate security posture in Benghazi, contributing to the deaths of four Americans, including the first U.S. ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979.\n\nThe report points to Clinton's own testimony that she was aware of the security concerns in Benghazi, though other reviews have stated she was never made aware of the specifics, including some of the requests for additional security or military protection that were denied.\n\nHouse Republicans, through the new website www.gop.gov/benghazi, aim to keep Benghazi as a political issue in 2014. The report appears to be designed to raise questions about Clinton in particular, as she considers another run for the White House in 2016.\n\nThe report contrasts the State Department's performance with that of the Defense Department, which the investigators said \"held military commanders accountable for what happened on their watch in Afghanistan.\" The report also faults Clinton's successor, Secretary John F. Kerry, for failing to take action regarding the security breaches.\n\nA separate review released last month by the Senate intelligence committee, run by Democrats, also found that the State Department should have done more to boost security. However, that review laid more blame on Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who the report said failed to ask for stiffer security in the immediate run-up to the attack. Stevens was killed in the initial assault.\n\nThe report's findings come as the Senate prepares to vote on Clinton's nomination as Secretary of State in President Biden's administration. The vote is expected to take place in the coming weeks.",

Tracey, who has been in Minneapolis for five days, noted that he had initially expected threats of violence from Antifa, but had not encountered any.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Tracey shared images of businesses that had been looted and destroyed, including a grocery and tobacco store owned by an Iranian, a Halal market, a Metro PCS store, a gas station convenience store, a wig shop, and a small deli. The deli owner shared that his security had fired shots to fend off the rioters, with the instigators primarily being white, while the blacks hung back.\n\nTracey also documented the destruction of a dentist's office that provided care to underprivileged children and the uninsured. He noted that the breadth of the destruction is probably not being covered by the media because it could be seen as helping President Trump, who has promised to maintain law and order during the chaos.\n\nTracey's tweets offer a glimpse into the aftermath of the protests and the impact they had on the community. The images and accounts shared by Tracey highlight the destruction and loss that businesses and residents in Minneapolis have experienced. The tweets also raise questions about the media's coverage of the protests and the extent of the destruction they caused.",

The events aim to reflect on the loss and advocate for stricter gun control measures to prevent future incidents.\n\nOFA's email to supporters encourages individuals to host events in their communities, providing resources to ensure the events serve as a poignant reminder of the 26 lives lost a year ago. Newtown green ribbons will be distributed during these events, both in person and online, to symbolize solidarity with the families of Sandy Hook.\n\nThe White House, through Vice President Joe Biden, also sent out an email via WhiteHouse.gov, focusing on President Obama's gun control executive orders and the need for further gun control legislation. The email highlights the progress made in implementing the 23 executive actions announced by President Obama in January, which aim to keep guns out of dangerous hands, provide support for school resource officers, and reduce the stigma around mental illness.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that none of the proposed gun control measures, as mentioned by Vice President Biden and OFA, would have prevented the Sandy Hook tragedy or other similar incidents. These incidents were not related to gun trafficking or the lack of universal background checks, as Vice President Biden suggests. Furthermore, under President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder's leadership, prosecutions of gun-related crimes have decreased by 45 percent.\n\nDespite these facts, both OFA and the White House continue to advocate for stricter gun control measures, emphasizing the need for expanded background checks and serious penalties for gun trafficking to protect children and keep communities safer. The emails serve as a reminder of the ongoing efforts to address gun violence in the United States.",
    " Title: White House Defends Clinton Foundation Donations Amid Uranium Deal Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is facing mounting questions regarding foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, particularly in relation to a deal that reportedly helped Russia secure a significant portion of the global uranium market with State Department approval.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has been grappling with similar questions, but neither the campaign nor the White House has provided sufficient answers to quell the growing uproar. The scrutiny surrounding foreign money associated with the Clintons, including substantial speaking fees for former President Bill Clinton and substantial donations to their charitable foundation following Hillary Clinton's appointment as America's top diplomat, is expected to intensify and persist throughout her campaign trail.\n\nDuring a press briefing, White House press secretary Josh Earnest insisted that President Obama is not troubled by reports that the Clinton Foundation accepted $2.35 million from a businessman involved in Russia's uranium deals, which required approval from the U.S. State Department as well as other countries.\n\n\"At this point, there has not been any evidence presented that would prompt the president or anybody at the White House to be unsettled by Secretary Clinton's conduct as secretary of state,\" said Mr. Earnest. \"In fact, everyone here at the White House, including the president, continues to be very proud of her service to this country.\"\n\nHowever, it was reported that the Clintons did not publicly disclose these donations, despite a memorandum of understanding between Clinton and the Obama administration that required donations to the foundation to be disclosed to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nThe deal granted Russia's atomic energy agency, Rosatom, control of uranium mines spanning from Asia to the Western U.S., including half of America's uranium supply. Shortly after the Russians announced plans to buy mining giant Uranium One, a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin and the deal paid Mr. Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow, according to The New York Times.\n\nWhen asked about the administration's concerns regarding questionable donations from foreign governments or foreign entities to the Clinton Foundation, Mr. Earnest said no. He also declined to answer a reporter's question on whether it is now \"clear\" that Mrs. Clinton did not abide by the agreement she signed with the administration before becoming secretary of state in 2009 to disclose donations to the foundation and the speaking fees paid to her husband.\n\nThe Clinton campaign did not respond to questions about violating the memorandum of understanding.\n\nMrs. Clinton, who is the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic presidential nomination, also faced criticism from her potential Republican rivals. Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard who plans to announce her Republican presidential run on May 4, wrote on her Facebook page, \"It's the Clinton way: raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep. Now they're scrambling to refile their taxes and account for her decisions as Secretary of State.\"\n\nThe Clinton campaign has attempted to downplay the controversy since it emerged this week in previews of the book \"Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.\" The book, by conservative political adviser Peter Schweizer, argues that the Clintons amassed wealth through speaking fees and donations in return for favors from Mrs. Clinton to various foreign interests while running the State Department.\n\nOther dealings include a free trade agreement in Colombia that benefited a major foundation donor's investments in the South American nation, development projects in Haiti after a devastating earthquake in 2010, and more than $1 million in payments to Mr. Clinton by a Canadian bank and major shareholder in the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which occurred while the project was under State Department review, according to reports.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has dismissed the accusations as a right-wing \"smear project,\" but this becomes increasingly difficult as mainstream news outlets pick up the story. Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon sent a memo Thursday to supporters and donors in an attempt to counter the accusations.\n\n\"The bottom line remains that the book fails to produce a shred of evidence supporting the theory that Hillary Clinton ever took action as Secretary of State for the purposes of supporting the interests of donors to the Clinton foundation,\" he wrote.\n\nAt a campaign stop in New Hampshire this week, Mrs. Clinton dismissed questions about connections between contributions from foreign entities and her actions as secretary of state, calling them merely \"distractions and attacks.\"\n\n\"I know that that comes, unfortunately, with the territory,\" she told The Associated Press.",
    " Title: Federal Strategy in Oregon Standoff Proves Effective, Minimizing Casualties and Damage\n\nArticle:\n\nThe standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which began in early January, has come to a close with the arrest of several self-appointed militiamen, led by the sons of right-wing radical Cliven Bundy. The group, who took over the refuge, demanded that federal lands be handed over to private interests, sparking concerns among liberals about the potential for violent confrontations.\n\nHowever, contrary to initial expectations, the federal government adopted a wait-and-see approach, allowing the militiamen to remain on the refuge for several weeks. This strategy, while initially criticized by some, has proven to be a successful approach in resolving the standoff peacefully.\n\nThe strategy of patience and restraint was a far more sensible way of dealing with the situation, as rushing the refuge would have given the militiamen the martyrdom they craved and potentially resulted in loss of innocent lives, as well as costly damage to the building. The federal strategy also effectively neutralized the propaganda value of the occupation, as the militiamen's true colors were exposed through their daily antics, proving them to be more clownish than courageous.\n\nThe arrest of the militiamen, which took place on an open highway, resulted in one fatality and eight arrests. The leaders of the occupation are now in custody, and the remaining militiamen holed up in the refuge are expected to surrender soon, given the absence of leadership and access to the outside world.\n\nThe federal strategy of patience and restraint, while initially criticized, has proven to be a more effective approach in resolving the standoff peacefully, minimizing casualties and damage. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of smarter, less aggressive policing, and the dangers of the \"shoot first\" philosophy of policing. The nation is currently engaged in a discussion about the dangers of this approach, prompted by the Black Lives Matter movement, and this story serves as a powerful example of why patience and focus on minimizing damage is a more effective and humane approach to policing.",
    " Title: International Aid Efforts Intensify as Typhoon Haiyan's Devastation in the Philippines Reveals Thousands of Missing and Dead\n\nThe aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, also known as Yolanda in the Philippines, continues to unfold in the Southeast Asian nation, with hundreds of thousands of people struggling to survive and authorities grappling to deliver aid to the hardest-hit areas.\n\nAccording to reports, Richard Gordon, head of the Philippine Red Cross, described the situation as \"absolute bedlam\" to the BBC. He stated, \"There's an awful lot of casualties, a lot of people dead all over the place, a lot of destruction.\"\n\nLynette Lim of Save the Children, who recently visited Tacloban, one of the most affected cities, described the scene as \"completely flattened\" and \"truly catastrophic.\"\n\nFreelance journalist Aurora Almendral, speaking to NPR from the town of Hilongos en route to Tacloban City, reported that some people who managed to secure food, water, and medicine were concerned about potential looters.\n\nOne young woman Almendral encountered had not heard from her family since before the storm. She lamented, \"Her father, mother, brother, and four-year-old daughter. She has absolutely no news.\"\n\nIn an effort to assist the typhoon relief efforts, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has ordered the aircraft carrier USS George Washington (CVN 73) and other U.S. Navy ships to the Philippines. Approximately 215 U.S. military personnel are currently deployed in the Philippines to aid in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan.\n\nUnited Nations officials report that about 9.5 million people in the Philippines have been affected by the typhoon and its aftermath, with around 620,000 forced from their homes. The number of confirmed deaths, which was just over 200 on Sunday, is now estimated to be around 1,000. However, officials are warning that the death toll could rise to 10,000.\n\nAs the U.S. military joins the rescue effort, foreign governments and aid groups have begun shipping food, medicine, and supplies to the hard-hit Visayas region on the Philippines' eastern seaboard. According to NPR's Anthony Kuhn, the U.S. military is bringing in water, generators, and trucks.\n\nMeanwhile, Typhoon Haiyan moved out into the South China Sea on Saturday and hit Vietnam on Monday in a significantly weakened state, although it still retained enough strength to uproot trees and tear roofs off hundreds of homes. National disaster officials in Vietnam reported no deaths on Monday, although state media stated that five people had died during preparations for the typhoon.\n\nFor those seeking information on missing family members in the Philippines, the International Red Cross has a webpage for \"restoring family links.\"",
    " Title: Synthetic Grass Advocates Push for Mandatory Installation in Drought-Stricken California\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to conserve water amidst the ongoing drought, The Synthetic Grass Warehouse, the nation's largest distributor of artificial grass, is urging California Governor Jerry Brown to consider a law mandating the use of synthetic grass across the state. The proposal aims to reduce the state's water consumption, particularly in the 6.4 billion gallons used daily for lawn care.\n\nThe Anaheim-based company suggests that Brown propose a law allowing and encouraging synthetic grass in various settings, including residential and commercial properties, parks, and pet areas. Victor Lanfranco, co-founder of The Synthetic Grass Warehouse, argues, \"If everyone in California switched to synthetic grass, eliminating just the need to water our lawns, we would no longer be in a drought. We need to welcome this idea in today's day and age as droughts are becoming more and more severe.\"\n\nThe synthetic grass offered by the company is not reminiscent of the astroturf of yesteryears. The fibrous tufts are richly textured and colored, available in a dozen varieties for home use alone. The grass part, non-absorbent and anti-bacterial, is groomed with a brush rather than a mower. The company's poster proclaims, \"Imagine a California where water was no longer wasted on grass!\"\n\nThe Atlanta-based Synthetic Turf Council estimates that replacing a typical 1,800 square-foot lawn with artificial grass could save 99,000 gallons of water per year, per lawn. Additionally, there would be no pesticide or fertilizer run-off.\n\nGovernor Brown has already proposed fines of up to $10,000 for excessive water use and has ordered a 25% reduction in statewide water usage. City and county agencies, along with retail and wholesale water agencies, will be able to issue penalties and enforce restrictions.\n\nHowever, homeowners face a dilemma as many homeowners associations require residents to water their lawns, while the state is simultaneously reducing water usage. Moreover, some associations do not allow homeowners to install synthetic grass. Lanfranco states, \"This is where we need our governor to step in.\"\n\nThe proposal for mandatory synthetic grass installation in California is a contentious issue, with proponents arguing for water conservation and opponents expressing concerns about the environmental impact and aesthetic appeal of artificial grass. The debate continues as California grapples with the ongoing drought.",
    " Title: President Trump Responds to Jay-Z's Remarks on Black Unemployment Rate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday morning, President Donald Trump responded to rapper Jay-Z's comments about the black unemployment rate during a CNN talk show interview. Trump stated, \"Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!\"\n\nThe president's comments seem to be a reaction to an appearance Jay-Z made on CNN host Van Jones' show. During the interview on Saturday night, Jay-Z stated that while the black unemployment rate has decreased, it does not necessarily mean that Trump is a good leader.\n\n\"It\u2019s not about money at the end of the day. Money does not equate to happiness,\" Jay-Z said. \"You\u2019re missing the whole point. You treat people like human beings. That\u2019s the main point. You can\u2019t treat someone like: you\u2019re going to treat me badly but pay me really well.\"\n\nThe black unemployment rate has reached its lowest levels since the 1970s, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which began recording the unemployment rate in America during that decade.\n\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing balanced and independent journalism, is currently working hard to counteract the biased nature of American media.

    " Title: US Deploys National Guard to Mexico Border, Trump Aims to End \"Catch and Release\" Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States state of Texas is deploying National Guard members to the border with Mexico following a call from President Donald Trump. A Guard spokesman stated that 250 personnel would be sent to patrol the area within the next 72 hours. Arizona is also planning to deploy 150 troops there next week.\n\nPresident Trump has expressed his intention to send up to 4,000 National Guard members to secure the border with Mexico, pending the construction of his proposed border wall. The states of New Mexico and California have been asked to take similar action to Texas and Arizona.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump outlined plans to end a practice known as \"catch and release,\" as part of his stricter anti-immigration policies. The aim is to detain illegal immigrants while they await deportation hearings, rather than releasing them.\n\nThe President has requested a detailed list of military and other facilities from the US Department of Defense that could perform this function. He has also sent several tweets over the past seven days, criticizing illegal immigration, accusing Democrats of allowing \"open borders, drugs, and crime,\" and urging Republicans to pass tougher immigration laws.\n\nIn response to President Trump's actions, Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto has condemned what he called \"threatening or disrespectful attitudes\" from the US President. The President has described sending troops to the Mexico border as a \"big step,\" but both his predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, also dispatched the National Guard there.\n\nThe US Department of Defense has approved funding for up to 4,000 National Guard troops from the Pentagon budget until the end of September. However, constructing a \"big, beautiful wall\" along the Mexican border, a signature Trump campaign promise, has been thwarted by lawmakers and appears to have stalled.\n\nA major government spending bill, which President Trump signed last month, included $1.6 billion for the border wall - far short of the $25 billion the White House sought. Most of the funding can only be used to repair existing sections of the border wall, not to build new segments.\n\nLast month, the Pentagon confirmed that President Trump had held \"initial\" talks with his defense secretary about using some of the Pentagon's budget to build a wall. However, two Democratic senators wrote to the defense secretary on Monday, stating that his department had \"no legal authority\" to use its funds for such a purpose.\n\nIn December, US Border Patrol announced that arrests at the southern border had fallen to their lowest level since 1971, indicating that fewer people were attempting the crossing.",
    " Title: New Mexico's Quay County Declares Itself a \"Second Amendment Sanctuary County\" in Protest of New Gun Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move of resistance against pending legislation that expands background check requirements for gun purchases, Quay County, New Mexico, has declared itself a \"Second Amendment Sanctuary County,\" according to Fox News. The county's decision comes in response to two controversial bills, HB 8 and HB 83, currently under consideration in the New Mexico House of Representatives.\n\nHB 8, if passed, would require background checks for gun purchases, even between private citizens. This measure has been criticized by the New Mexico Sheriff's Association as an unenforceable law. HB 83, on the other hand, would establish an \"Extreme Risk Protection Order\" that would allow for the seizure of guns and ammunition from individuals deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nNew Mexico House Republicans have expressed support for Quay County's decision, with state Rep. Rod Montoya (R-Farmington) stating, \"We see counties starting to fight back against the over-reach of House Democrats. New Mexicans who are not even accused of a crime can lose their 2nd Amendment rights under this bill, and that's beyond wrong.\"\n\nUnder HB 8, it would be a misdemeanor to buy or sell a gun privately without a federal background check. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has come out against both HB 8 and HB 83, with the NRA Institute for Legislative Action stating that HB 83 \"violates due process and puts law enforcement in a more dangerous situation, and does nothing to protect citizens.\"\n\nThe NRA's statement further reads, \"Unchallenged statements made by a petitioner before a judge, alleging that someone is a danger to themselves or others in an ex parte proceeding \u2014 prior to any formal court hearing at which the respondent can be represented by counsel and present counter evidence \u2014 would be sufficient for law enforcement to enter that person's home and confiscate their private property.\"\n\nState Representative Black has also voiced his agreement with the sheriffs and county commissions, stating, \"I agree with our sheriffs and our county commissions, both of which are telling us these bills only harm law-abiding New Mexicans.\" The debate over these gun laws continues as they move through the legislative process.",
    " Title: Democrats Alter Senate Filibuster Rule to Advance Judicial and Executive Nominations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic shift, the United States Senate, led by the Democratic Party, has altered the filibuster rule to expedite the confirmation of judicial and executive nominations. The move comes in response to the Republican Party's obstructionist tactics, which have hindered the confirmation process for several key appointments during the Obama administration.\n\nThe decision, made by all but three Senate Democrats, was prompted by the Republicans' refusal to confirm appointments to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. This move was seen as an attempt to maintain a conservative majority on this influential court.\n\nThe Republicans had previously employed similar tactics earlier this year, aiming to impede the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, two agencies they have been critical of, by blocking all appointments to these agencies. This obstruction was lifted in July, following Harry Reid's threat to end the filibuster, which the Republicans eventually relented to.\n\nThe latest blockade of judges to the D.C. appellate court was the catalyst for the rule change. Republicans had warned that such a move could have repercussions if the Democrats lost the White House and the Senate. However, the Constitution grants presidents the right to nominate top officials in their administration and name judges, and it does not stipulate the ability of a Senate minority to obstruct these appointments.\n\nThe rule change now means that presidents are more likely to see their nominations approved if their party controls the Senate. In the past half of all filibusters waged against nominations in Senate history have occurred since President Obama was elected. Twenty of his district court nominees were filibustered, while only three such filibusters took place before he took office.\n\nThe rule change does not abolish the 60-vote threshold for blocking legislation, a practice that has been argued to be worth preserving. However, the rule change could pave the way for broader filibuster reforms. A proposal by several younger Democratic senators to require \"talking filibusters\" - forcing objecting lawmakers to stand up at length and make their cases - may gain momentum, potentially ending logjams that have prevented important legislation from reaching votes.",
    " Title: Beto O'Rourke Denies Attempting to Flee Scene of 1998 DWI Accident\n\nIn a recent debate against U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke denied attempting to flee the scene of a 1998 drunken car crash, contradicting police reports published by the Houston Chronicle last month.\n\nDuring the debate at Southern Methodist University, O'Rourke stated, \"I did not try to leave the scene of the accident, though driving drunk, which I did, is a terrible mistake for which there is no excuse or justification or defense.\" He further added, \"I can only tell you that I was able to have a second chance in my life.\"\n\nHowever, the police report, which was published by the Houston Chronicle last month, claimed that O'Rourke \"attempted to leave the accident\" after he lost control of his car and hit another vehicle in 1998. The report also stated that a witness \"turned on his overhead lights to warn oncoming traffic and to try to get [O'Rourke] to stop.\"\n\nThis is the first time O'Rourke has challenged reports of the incident. Last month, he acknowledged that he \"drove drunk and was arrested for DWI in 1998.\" He did not deny he tried to flee the scene in his previous statements.\n\nThe police report also stated that O'Rourke was visibly intoxicated and \"unable to be understood due to slurred speech.\" O'Rourke recorded 0.136 and 0.134 blood alcohol levels on Breathalyzer tests, the records said. The state legal limit at the time was 0.10. The charges of DWI were later dismissed after he completed a court-approved diversion program, the Chronicle reported.",
    " Title: EU Members Rush to Address Future of Union as UK Exit Looms, Possible Exodus of Other Nations a Concern\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the European Union's founding nations convened in an emergency meeting on Saturday to discuss the future of the alliance, Germany's government reportedly expressed concerns that the United Kingdom could be the first of several nations to withdraw. The fear is that if the EU were to sever ties with Britain, other countries such as France, the Netherlands, Hungary, Austria, and Finland may lose incentive to remain.\n\nIn a plea for the EU to maintain a relationship with the UK, the government-run German newspaper Die Welt called for the UK to be considered an \"associated partner country.\" Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party, celebrated the Brexit vote results, describing the EU as \"doomed\" and \"dying.\" Far-right leaders in France and the Netherlands have also called for their own referendums on EU membership, according to Sky News.\n\nForeign ministers from Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg met in Berlin on Saturday and issued a statement expressing their desire for Britain to quickly invoke the article in the EU charter that allows it to begin negotiations on departure. They acknowledged the need to find better ways to address the varying levels of commitment to closer European unity among member states.\n\nAn online petition seeking a second Brexit referendum drew over 1 million signatures, reflecting the deep divisions caused by Thursday's vote to leave the 28-nation bloc. The petition site hosted by the House of Commons website crashed on Friday due to the unprecedented interest in the measure.\n\nScotland plans to initiate talks with EU nations and institutions to explore ways to remain in the bloc despite Britain's vote to leave. Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon also indicated that a new referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom is \"on the table.\"\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen both weighed in on the situation, with Orban stating that \"Brussels must hear the voice of the people, this is the biggest lesson from this decision.\" Rasmussen added that Britain's exit \"will echo for years to come and change the Europe as we know it.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that Britain should not take an excessive amount of time to deliver formal notification of its intent to leave the EU, but also made it clear that the decision is in London's hands. Merkel expressed a desire for an \"objective, good\" climate in the negotiations, stating that they should be conducted properly without any unnecessary hostility.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault suggested that Britain should name a new prime minister in the coming days to expedite the departure process. However, given the political turmoil in Britain, it is likely to take months to name a replacement for outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron. Ayrault stated that designating a new prime minister would require several days.",
    " Title: Voting Irregularities: Long Lines in Florida, Confusion in New Jersey and Other States\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election day progresses, reports of irregularities have surfaced across several states. In this article, we will be tracking significant voting issues that have emerged so far, with a focus on long lines and confusion in Florida, New Jersey, and other states.\n\nOne of the most prevalent problems on Election Day has been long lines at polling stations. In Florida, some voters have reported waiting up to three hours to cast their ballots. The Miami Herald reported dramatic cases where voters refused to leave the line despite fainting, and in one instance, a man suffering a seizure while filling out his ballot. At the Miami-Dade election headquarters in El Doral, the paper spoke to one woman who was in line holding a catheter bag.\n\nThe long lines in Florida can be attributed to the length of the ballot. With the proposed amendments, which are backed by Republican state lawmakers, the ballot is significantly longer than in previous elections. One amendment, which proposes tax breaks for owners of vacation homes, comes in at 640 words. If voters have not done their homework, they have to read their way through a ballot that in some counties is 12 pages long.\n\nLong lines were also a problem in battleground Virginia, where people were late for work due to the lengthy queues. In New Hampshire, voters struggled to find parking spaces and were anticipating long wait times in lines. The New York Times reports that the combination of Superstorm Sandy and heavy turnout yielded long lines, confusion, frustration, and anger in the city.\n\nBecause of Superstorm Sandy, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie authorized the use of fax and email voting. However, the Newark Star-Ledger reports that some voters who requested ballots through those methods never received them. Perhaps most problematic, however, is that when the state announced the new provisions, they did not mention that those people voting by email or fax also need to send a hardcopy via mail. The Star-Ledger reports that one expert thinks email voting could lead to problems:\n\n\"You must have a paper ballot backup,\" said Penny Venetis, a professor at Rutgers University School of Law in Newark. \"What's puzzling is that the lieutenant governor's directives allow Internet voting without requiring this protection that is necessary to ensure the integrity of the vote.\"\n\nVoters using the e-mail option still must print, sign, and scan a physical ballot, then send it to their county clerk via email. However, hackers can forge those ballots or signatures, send in fraudulent votes, and then erase their tracks online, said Andrew Appel, a computer science professor at Princeton University.\n\nIn Pinellas County, Florida, the Supervisor of Elections Office mistakenly made robocalls that told voters they had until 7 p.m. \"tomorrow\" to turn in mail-in ballots. \"But that is wrong. Polls close at 7 p.m. Tuesday. Any ballots turned in after that time won't be accepted,\" the calls stated. The calls went out between 8 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. because of a glitch with the SOE's phone system. About 12,000 calls, however, did not get through, said SOE spokeswoman Nancy Whitlock. They were stored in a queue and recycled Tuesday morning. The \"tomorrow\" in the message meant for Monday was incorrect when it was delivered.\n\nThe SOE told the paper that they stopped sending out calls as soon as they noticed the problem.",
    " Title: \"Jane Mayer's Analysis of Fox News and White House Relationship Sparks Controversy\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent article for The New Yorker titled \"The Making of the Fox News White House,\" investigative journalist Jane Mayer has sparked a heated debate with her analysis of the relationship between Fox News and the current White House. The article suggests that the alignment between the two entities is unprecedented, with Fox News executive Bill Shine's move from Fox to the White House communications operation being a key point.\n\nHowever, Mayer's assertion of this being an unprecedented relationship has been met with skepticism. Critics argue that the notion of a friendly relationship between news networks and the White House, or media executives moving into politics, is not a new phenomenon.\n\nOn MSNBC's Morning Joe, Mayer expressed concern about the closeness between Fox News and the White House, stating, \"We've really never had a whole national network like this... it's incredibly close with this White House.\"\n\nCritics point out instances of media bias in the past, such as journalists covering up Franklin D. Roosevelt's disability, or downplaying John F. Kennedy's debauchery. They also highlight Obama strategist Ben Rhodes' boast to The New York Times about creating an \"echo chamber\" in the press, and the Times' positive response.\n\nMayer's criticism of Fox News' \"rage-based model\" has also been met with criticism, as she is accused of ignoring similar models in liberal media outlets. Some argue that networks like MSNBC and CNN, which she mentions in her criticism of Fox News, also have partisan agendas that contribute to the polarization of the country.\n\nThe article has sparked a larger conversation about media bias and the role of news networks in shaping public opinion. Critics argue that Mayer's analysis is hypocritical, as she overlooks instances of media bias in liberal media outlets while criticizing Fox News.\n\nThe article has also brought attention to the close relationship between media figures and political figures, with examples such as Chris Matthews' public support for Obama and David Remnick's adoring interviews with Obama and book about Valerie Jarrett.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Mayer and The New Yorker have not issued a statement. The article has, however, sparked a larger conversation about media bias and the role of news networks in shaping public opinion.",
    " Title: Justice Department Threatens Lawsuit Against Harvard Over Alleged Discrimination Against Asian-American Applicants\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the U.S. Justice Department has issued a warning to Harvard University, threatening to sue the prestigious Ivy League institution over potential violations of civil rights laws due to alleged discrimination against Asian-American applicants. The threat comes as part of an investigation into Harvard's admission policies, which the Justice Department believes may be in breach of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe Justice Department's letter, dated Friday and obtained by various media outlets, sets a Dec. 1 deadline for Harvard to hand over documents detailing its admission policies. The department is investigating Harvard's compliance with Title VI, which prohibits institutions receiving federal funding from discriminating based on race, color, or national origin.\n\nThe investigation follows reports of a broader probe into whether university affirmative action admission policies may be discriminating against white applicants. The Justice Department's letter states that it has concluded that Harvard is out of compliance with its Title VI access obligations.\n\nHarvard's attorneys, in an October 6 letter to the Justice Department, have questioned the timing of the investigation, stating that it is unusual for the department to resurrect a complaint filed nearly 2-1/2 years earlier.\n\nHarvard has consistently maintained that its admissions policies are in line with U.S. laws. The university has also worked to increase financial aid to ensure economic and racial diversity in its classes. In 2017, more than one in five freshmen admitted were Asian, and almost 15 percent were African-American.\n\nIn response to the investigation, Harvard spokeswoman Anna Cowenhoven stated, \"The university will certainly comply with its obligations under Title VI. We have an obligation to protect the confidentiality of student and applicant files and other highly sensitive records.\"\n\nAffirmative action programs in higher education were designed to address racial discrimination. The Supreme Court has ruled that universities may use affirmative action with the aim of helping minority applicants gain admission to colleges. However, critics argue that such policies can inadvertently disadvantage white applicants and Asian-Americans.\n\nIn response to the investigation, a Justice Department spokesperson, Devin O' Malley, stated, \"The Department of Justice takes seriously any potential violation of an individual's civil and constitutional rights.\"\n\nThis development marks a significant escalation in the ongoing debate over affirmative action in higher education and the balance between promoting diversity and ensuring fairness in the admissions process.",
    " Title: Iowa Democratic Chairman Endorses Sanders Over Clinton Amidst Wall Street Ties Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent Democratic debate, John Wittneben, the Democratic chairman in Emmet County, Iowa, has endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in the presidential race. This decision comes as Hillary Rodham Clinton faces criticism over her ties to Wall Street, a controversy that has become a significant vulnerability in states with early nomination contests.\n\nMr. Wittneben, who lost 40 percent of his savings in individual retirement accounts during the Great Recession, expressed his disapproval of Clinton's financial ties to Wall Street executives. \"People knew what they were doing back then, because of greed, and it caused me harm,\" he said, emphasizing the importance of fairness in his community.\n\nClinton's windfalls from Wall Street banks and other financial services firms - $3 million in paid speeches and $17 million in campaign contributions over the years - have been a contentious issue. Some undecided party officials view her as overly cozy with big banks and other special interests. This image problem, which Clinton attempted to address in an October debate by reminding viewers that she \"represented Wall Street as a senator from New York,\" seems difficult for her to shake off.\n\nDespite her criticism of the American economy as being \"rigged\" for the rich, Clinton's perceived leniency towards Wall Street excess if elected has led to a loss of support from some party members. Her refusal to support the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act, a law that separated commercial and investment banks until its repeal under President Bill Clinton, is a point of contention. Sanders, on the other hand, favors its restoration.\n\nFurthermore, Clinton's strong support from wealthy donors and a big-money \"super PAC\" undermines her increasingly progressive rhetoric on free trade and other economic issues, according to many Democrats. This endorsement from Mr. Wittneben, a representative of the grassroots, underscores the growing concern among some Democrats that Clinton's ties to Wall Street may compromise her ability to enact the progressive economic policies they desire.",
    " Title: President Trump Responds to Report of FBI Investigation Launched After Firing of James Comey\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Saturday, President Donald Trump responded to a report by The New York Times that the FBI had launched an investigation of the president in 2017, following his firing of FBI Director James B. Comey.\n\nThe Times reported Friday night that FBI officials opened a probe of Mr. Trump immediately after he fired Mr. Comey in May 2017. The report, citing former officials and others familiar with the probe, said law enforcement officials \"became so concerned by the president's behavior that they began investigating whether he had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests.\" Part of the probe was criminal in nature, looking at whether the president obstructed justice.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller took over the probe several days later upon his appointment by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nIn his tweets, Mr. Trump defended his actions and criticized Mr. Comey, who he fired. He said he has been \"FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton.\"\n\n\"At the same time, & as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing,\" he tweeted. \"I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!\"\n\nMr. Trump also said, \"Everybody wanted him fired, Republican and Democrat alike.\" He added, \"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the development \"absurd.\" She said, unlike former President Barack Obama, Mr. Trump \"has actually been tough on Russia.\"\n\nRep. Devin Nunes of California, ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said the Times' report is \"yet more evidence that FBI leaders actually had no real evidence against the Trump team.\"\n\n\"Instead, they were simply trying to undermine a president they didn't like and avenge Comey's firing,\" said Mr. Nunes, who as chairman of the panel in the previous Congress issued a report clearing the Trump campaign of collusion with Russia.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, New York Democrat, indicated that he plans to look into the development.\n\n\"In the coming weeks, the Judiciary Committee will take steps to better understand both the president's actions and the FBI's response to that behavior, and to make certain that these career investigators are protected from President Trump's increasingly unhinged attacks,\" Mr. Nadler said in a statement.\n\n\"There is no reason to doubt the seriousness or professionalism of the FBI, as the president did in reaction to this story. Indeed, his go-to complaints\u2014about former Director Comey and Secretary Clinton\u2014do nothing to address the incredibly serious nature of these allegations,\" Mr. Nadler added.",
    " Title: President Obama Acknowledges U.S. Torture of al Qaeda Detainees, Expresses Support for CIA Director\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant admission, President Barack Obama acknowledged on Friday that the United States did torture al Qaeda detainees captured following the 9/11 attacks. This statement marks one of the most expansive comments he has made on the controversial CIA practices he banned upon taking office.\n\n\"We tortured some folks,\" Obama said during a televised news conference at the White House. \"We did some things that were contrary to our values.\"\n\nAddressing the forthcoming release of a Senate report that criticizes the CIA's treatment of detainees, Obama attributed the mistreatment to the pressure national security officials felt to prevent further attacks. He urged Americans not to be overly \"sanctimonious\" when judging the actions of the past through the lens of the seemingly safer present day.\n\nThis stance, which Obama adopted as a presidential candidate in 2008 and early in his presidency, explains why he did not push for criminal charges against Bush-era officials who carried out the CIA program. Many of these officials maintain that their actions were not torture, which is a felony under U.S. law.\n\nIn contrast to his previous comments on the subject, Obama's remarks on Friday were more emphatic, including a 2009 speech where he declared his ban on \"so-called enhanced interrogation techniques\" and \"brutal methods,\" but did not explicitly state that the U.S. had engaged in torture.\n\n\"I believe that waterboarding was torture, and whatever legal rationales were used, it was a mistake,\" he said in April 2009.\n\nThe administration of President George W. Bush authorized the use of harsh interrogation techniques on militant detainees in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, after deciding they did not constitute torture. Obama explained that the techniques were employed due to the fear of imminent further attacks.\n\n\"It's important for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect about the tough job that those folks had,\" he said. \"A lot of those folks were working hard under enormous pressure and are real patriots.\"\n\nOn Friday, Obama did not address two other central arguments of the soon-to-be-released Senate report: that the brutal interrogations did not yield life-saving intelligence, and that the CIA deceived other elements of the U.S. government about its actions.\n\nThe president also expressed confidence in his CIA Director, John Brennan, in the face of an internal CIA report documenting improper access to Senate computers. There have been calls for his resignation on Capitol Hill.",
    " Title: Ongoing Nuclear Negotiations with Iran: A Delicate Balance of Power and Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing diplomatic standoff, another deadline passed this week in the protracted negotiations over Iran's nuclear weapons programs, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warning that a failure to reach a deal could signal the end of the process. Kerry emphasized, \"If the tough decisions don't get made, we are absolutely prepared to call an end to this process.\"\n\nThe ongoing negotiations, taking place in Vienna among Iran, Russia, China, Britain, France, Germany, and the United States, are not aimed at eliminating Iran's nuclear weapons program. Instead, the focus is on determining how much nuclear infrastructure Iran can retain, the extent of inspections on remaining facilities, and the concessions offered in return.\n\nInspections are crucial to any agreement aimed at reducing the threat posed by Iran's nuclear weapons programs. The negotiations aim to increase the \"breakout time\" \u2013 the length of time it would take Iran, using known equipment and nuclear materials, to construct a nuclear bomb. The current estimate places Iran's breakout time at 2-3 months, and the negotiations are seeking to extend this to a year.\n\nIran's reluctance to accept several favorable deals offered so far suggests that the negotiations may serve as a satisfactory end in themselves for the Iranian government. This is particularly true for Ayatollah Khameni, who may fear domestic political repercussions from reintegrating with the international community.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge that the extent of Iran's nuclear weapons work and the number of its facilities remain largely unknown. This is not due to a lack of effort by intelligence services but rather the fact that much of what is known about Iranian nuclear programs was revealed, and there remains much that is not.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has played a significant role in shaping Iran policy, imposing sanctions that the Obama administration now claims credit for. Senators Corker and Cardin have ensured that, should an agreement be reached in Vienna, the Congress will now have 60 days to review the president's handiwork, a move the administration had sought to avoid.\n\nAny agreement reached will result in the easing of sanctions on Iran, with Russia unlikely to reinstate them, regardless of Iranian violations. The $100 billion in revenue resulting from the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions will primarily benefit the Revolutionary Guards and Iranian citizen militia, who control much of the Iranian economy.\n\nAn Iran deal would alleviate a political problem for President Obama, who has pledged to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon but has expressed reluctance to use military force against Iran. A nuclear deal resolves this political issue, but it has already created security concerns as regional allies adjust to the U.S.'s perceived intentions.\n\nA continuing negotiation, free from deadlines, might help alleviate some of the insecurity. It prevents the lifting of sanctions that would be impossible to reimpose once removed. It provides exposure to Iranian leaders and potentially valuable intelligence on their nuclear infrastructure. It maintains alignment with the three European Union states whose sanctions have been a significant constraint on the Iranian government. It makes it more difficult for Russia and China to support Iran. And it allows for continued espionage, the kind that has prevented Iran from crossing the nuclear threshold so far, as we understand it.\n\nIran does not appear to have made the fundamental choice to abandon its nuclear weapons programs. Until it does, continued negotiations may be a better outcome than an agreement.",
    " Title: Poll Shows Shift in American Perceptions of Race, Potential Impact on 2020 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - A comprehensive analysis of public opinion over the past four years suggests that U.S. President Donald Trump's brand of white identity politics may be less effective in the 2020 election campaign. The analysis comes amid widespread criticism of Trump's racially charged comments and the fallout from a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, that many Democratic presidential candidates swiftly blamed on the president's rhetoric.\n\nAccording to a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll of 4,436 U.S. adults in July, people who rejected racial stereotypes were more interested in voting in the 2020 general election than those who expressed stronger levels of anti-black or anti-Hispanic biases. In 2016, the reverse was true. The analysis shows that Trump's narrow win came at a time when Americans with strong anti-black opinions were the more politically engaged group.\n\nThe July poll found that among Americans who feel that blacks and whites are equal, or that blacks are superior to whites, 82% expressed a strong interest in voting in 2020. That was 7 percentage points higher than people who feel strongly that whites are superior to blacks.\n\nUniversity of Michigan political scientist Vincent Hutchings, who reviewed the \u2588\u2588\u2588 findings, said, \"There is some indication that racial liberals are more energized than the racially intolerant. That would seem to be good news for the Democrats and bad news for the Republicans.\"\n\nThe July poll did have a silver lining for Trump. Most white Republicans approve of his performance in office, and over the past four years, they have become increasingly supportive of his signature issue: expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Some 82% now support it compared to 75% last year.\n\nTrump is still as popular as ever with conservatives who dominate the predominantly white, working-class communities that helped him win in 2016, said Duke University political scientist Ashley Jardina, who also reviewed the poll findings. In his 2016 campaign, Trump focused on the grievances of white voters who feared the global economy was leaving them behind and who wanted more restrictions on immigration. He employed put-downs of Latino immigrants and inner-city, typically black, residents.\n\nResponding to the \u2588\u2588\u2588 polling analysis, a spokesman for Trump's reelection campaign, Daniel Bucheli, said the president \"enjoys broad support from diverse groups of Americans, and this coalition of supporters, to include minorities and first-time voters, continues to grow daily.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on the poll findings. The \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis also found that Americans were less likely to express feelings of racial anxiety this year, and they were more likely to empathize with African Americans. This was also true for white Americans and whites without a college degree, who largely backed Trump in 2016.\n\nWhite Americans are also 19 percentage points more supportive of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and 4 points less supportive of increased deportations, when their responses from the July poll were compared with a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll in January 2015. The July 17-22 poll also found that 29% of whites agreed that \"America must protect and preserve its White European heritage,\" down 7 points from a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll conducted in August 2017 and 9 points down from another \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll in August 2018.\n\nPaula Ioanide, an expert in American race relations at Ithaca College, said the poll findings were consistent with her research that racial anxieties among whites peaked during the presidency of Barack Obama. Some white Americans \"are not feeling as under attack as they did in 2016,\" Ioanide said. With Trump in the White House, \"they've seen a kind of endorsement of the kinds of things that they wanted: A restoration of a white identity that they previously had felt was under attack.\"",
    " Title: Maryland Governor Larry Hogan's Rising Profile and Potential 2020 Presidential Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan's name is gaining traction, with some speculating whether he could challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 Republican primary. Hogan, a two-term governor with a reputation for bipartisan cooperation, has been making waves in the political sphere, particularly during the recent government shutdown, where he publicly criticized the President's handling of the situation.\n\nHogan, a 62-year-old businessman before entering politics, is known for his no-nonsense demeanor and his ability to work across party lines. He has been vocal in his criticism of Trump, particularly during the government shutdown, which had a significant impact on Maryland due to its large federal workforce.\n\nAt Baltimore-Washington International Airport in January, Hogan highlighted the plight of TSA workers and took a jab at Trump, who many blamed for the shutdown. \"It's crazy. It's like, 'If I don't get my wall, I'm going to shut down the government.' 'If we don't open the government, you can't speak in our chamber.' It's a bunch of 2-year-olds, you know?\" Hogan said, mocking both Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nHogan's approach to governance, characterized by moderation and centrism, has made him popular in Maryland. However, this same approach may not translate well in the early primary states like Iowa or South Carolina, where conservative, religiously-minded voters are more likely to support Trump.\n\nDespite this, Hogan has not ruled out a potential 2020 run. In a recent interview on CNN, he stated, \"I would only run if I thought that I could actually win.\" Hogan's expected visit to the early caucus state of Iowa in March further fuels speculation about his political ambitions.\n\nJerry Taylor, head of the libertarian-leaning think tank Niskanen Center, is one of Hogan's most vocal supporters. Taylor believes Hogan represents a \"different vision of the Republican Party\" and could be popular among voters in both parties.\n\nHowever, knocking off an incumbent president in the primaries is a daunting task. The last time a sitting president lost his party's re-nomination battle was in 1856. Melissa Deckman, a political science professor at Washington College in Maryland, echoes this sentiment, stating, \"Trump remains enormously popular with the base of his party. And I think that it would in some respects be a fool's errand for just about anyone to challenge Donald Trump at this point.\"\n\nAs Hogan focuses on his second term in Maryland, the question of a potential presidential bid remains a topic of discussion. Whether Hogan will indeed challenge Trump in 2020 remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the political landscape is watching what Maryland's governor is doing.",
    " Title: Controversial Song by South Bend Pastor Criticizes Evangelical Support for President Trump\n\nA worship pastor in South Bend, Indiana, has gained attention for a song he wrote titled \"Hymn for the 81%,\" a reference to white evangelical Christian voters who helped secure President Trump's victory in 2016. The song, which has over 400,000 views on YouTube, is a plea, according to Daniel Deitrich, the pastor for arts and worship at South Bend City Church, for these voters to return to the teachings of Jesus.\n\nThe anti-Trump pastor's song accuses Trump evangelicals of \"putting kids in cages, ripping mothers from their babies\" and \"weaponizing religion.\" Deitrich told Religion News Service he originally wrote the song's bridge as \"an angry middle finger to the listener\" and found it \"cathartic,\" but he toned it down and plans on releasing more songs.\n\nTrump's spiritual adviser, Paula White, has stated that Deitrich's prayer was taken \"out of context for political gain.\" However, Faithwire editor Tr\u00e9 Goins-Phillips argues that the song is not a worship song, stating that \"Deitrich\u2019s words are not elevating or edifying; they are divisive.\" Goins-Phillips believes that worship and discipleship should challenge individuals, but in a way that calls them back to Scripture, not to their anger towards one another.\n\nIn recent weeks, anti-Trump evangelicals have been vocal in their opposition to the president and his supporters. Former editor-in-chief of Christianity Today, Mark Galli, wrote an op-ed titled \"Trump Should be Removed from Office,\" and a group of \"Never Trump\" Republicans released an attack ad called \"The MAGA Church,\" mocking Trump's character and evangelicals' support of him. The two events surrounded the Trump 2020 campaign's launch of \"Evangelicals for Trump,\" where more than 70 prominent pastors came out in support of Trump's re-election bid.\n\nDeitrich told RNS that he wrote the song as a response to the issues of white supremacy, homophobia, transphobia, and sexism that he sees in society. He stated, \"There\u2019s so much work to do to combat white supremacy, homophobia, transphobia, sexism \u2014 all the ways in which people are treated as less than the children of God that they are.\" The pastor's song has sparked a debate among Christians regarding the role of faith in politics and the appropriate tone for worship music.",
    " Title: Democrats Push for Full Release of Mueller Report and Testimony from Attorney General Barr\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report concluding that there was no evidence of collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia during the 2016 election, Democrats have shown no signs of letting up. Congressional leaders are calling for the release of the full report, underlying documents, and testimony from Attorney General Bill Barr.\n\nBarr, who released a four-page summary of Mueller's findings on Sunday, noted that while the special counsel did not find evidence of collusion, he did not come to a conclusion on whether President Trump obstructed justice. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw the majority of the Russia investigation after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, concluded that the evidence was \"not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\"\n\nThis conclusion has raised red flags for Democrats, who have signaled that the Mueller report is by no means the end of Trump investigations. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, in a joint statement Sunday night, blasted Barr as \"not a neutral observer\" and claimed he \"is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report.\"\n\n\"Congress requires the full report and the underlying documents so that the Committees can proceed with their independent work, including oversight and legislating to address any issues the Mueller report may raise,\" they continued. \"The American people have a right to know.\"\n\nFox News has learned that Mueller told Barr and Rosenstein three weeks ago that he would not be able to reach a conclusion on obstruction of justice.\n\nWith Mueller's decision not to issue a conclusion on the obstruction of justice issue, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said that it \"seems like the Department of Justice is putting matters squarely in Congress's court.\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler has vowed to have Barr testify before the committee \"in the near future,\" and said there \"must be full transparency\" on what Mueller uncovered \"to not exonerate the President from wrongdoing.\"\n\nNadler, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, and House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, in a joint statement, called into question Barr's \"objectivity\" and called for the release of the Special Counsel's full and complete report and all underlying documents.\n\nMeanwhile, other House Democrats have aggressively ramped up their own Trump-related investigations, which are likely to include a network of committee probes and high-profile hearings that are likely to last well into the 2020 election year. At this point, the House Intelligence Committee is probing the president's foreign business dealings and Russian election meddling, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Chairman Eliot Engel, is also probing the president's foreign business dealings.",
    " Title: The Rise of Asian-American Republicans: A New Era of Political Representation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2014 midterm elections, Asian-Americans, the fastest-growing minority group in the United States, demonstrated a significant shift in political allegiance, with nearly half of Asian-American voters backing the Republican candidate for the House of Representatives. This 46-point swing in Asian support from 2012, when Asians voted overwhelmingly for President Obama's re-election, has left political pundits questioning the sudden change in party affiliation.\n\nHowever, the eye-popping exit poll data may not accurately reflect long-term success. This shift in support is not a result of the traditional Republican outreach methods, such as nominating minority candidates in long-shot districts or last-minute ads in another language. Instead, the Republican Party has been strategically building a bench of Asian-American candidates, with more than three-dozen winning elections at the state and local level in the 2014 elections.\n\nThese victories, while not high-profile, are significant, as they will contribute to long-term success for the Republican Party. As Lanhee Chen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, noted in his post-election analysis, the Republican Party has finally devoted time, attention, and resources to cultivating Asian voters.\n\nOne of the most notable victories was Aumua Amata Radewagen, a member of the Republican National Committee, who will become American Samoa's first female representative to Congress. In Arizona, State Sen. Kimberly Yee, the first Asian-American elected to the state legislature, cruised to re-election by 18 points. Even in traditionally Democratic strongholds like California, the Republican Party backed four successful Asian-American women running for the state legislature and county board of supervisors.\n\nThe election of these Asian-American candidates has a compounding effect. \"Once a community member is elected to a prominent position, it could inspire others with similar backgrounds to lead as well,\" argues Tim Nguyen, chair of the Asian Pacific American Coalition. Newly elected California State Sen. Janet Nguyen, the highest-ranking Vietnamese-American in the country, can recruit candidates from Little Saigon to run as Republican candidates for school board and city council.\n\nConnecticut State Sen. Tony Hwang can raise money from the Taiwanese-American community that would otherwise never see its way to Republican coffers. San Diego City Council Chris Cate, the first Asian-American in half a century to be elected to the San Diego City Council, has the charisma to introduce GOP presidential candidates to Filipino-American voters in swing states, such as Nevada, Florida, and Virginia.\n\nAny one of these rising stars is poised to win a conservative Republican primary for Congress. Take Oklahoma State Sen.-elect Ervin Yen, a first-generation Taiwanese-American immigrant, who is rock-solid on gun rights. \"America was built by patriots who used guns to provide for their families, protect their homes, and overthrow tyranny,\" Mr. Yen, who immigrated to the United States after the Communist takeover of China, writes on his campaign website. \"I am a strong believer that those principles are what still makes America great and that the Second Amendment must be defended from liberals who would take away our hard-won rights.\"\n\nFor the next two years, Republicans like Mr. Yen will be featured almost daily in Asian-language newspapers, sharing a conservative message with communities who have for too long been taken for granted by the Democrats. The Republican Party has elected a bench of bilingual stars who have real political power. And you can expect their influence to dramatically increase when the 2016 presidential candidates start calling.\n\nShawn Steel, a former chairman of the California Republican Party and the state's national committeeman on the Republican National Committee, is one of these stars. His influence, along with the other Asian-American Republicans, will be crucial in the upcoming elections and beyond.",
    " Title: The Militarization of Police: A Rise in SWAT Raids and the Concerns Surrounding Tactics and Equipment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his book \"Rise of the Warrior Cop,\" Radley Balko recounts the escalation of police Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams, which began as a specialized unit for handling violent situations such as hostage-takings. The use of SWAT teams, armed with heavy military equipment, has increased significantly over the past few decades, with the number of SWAT raids rising from approximately 300 per year in the 1970s to 100 to 150 per day as of 2005.\n\nThe transformation of SWAT teams from a few specialized groups into small armies conducting raids on organic farms and legal medical marijuana dispensaries has raised concerns about the potential for terrorizing innocent people, raiding the wrong homes, and causing violence. The increase in SWAT raids began under Nixon-era politicians who sought to appear tough on crime, even if it meant exaggerating the threat posed by illegal drugs.\n\nAs the war on drugs escalated, police stopped announcing themselves when entering homes to avoid drug users destroying evidence. This change in centuries-old practice has led to numerous instances of innocent people being killed during SWAT raids. For example, Iraq War veteran Jose Guerena was killed in 2011 when police raided his home, suspecting drugs were present. After Guerena was killed, no drugs or evidence of drug dealing were found, and his brother was arrested on drug charges. Balko states, \"It appears Guerena's crime was being related to someone.\"\n\nThe War on Terror has also contributed to the militarization of police, with the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security offering armored vehicles, body armor, and stun grenades to police departments, large or small. Local police have eagerly accepted these new resources, expanding the circumstances under which such equipment is used.\n\nThe police chief in Concord, New Hampshire, for instance, cited the presence of libertarians who moved to the state seeking increased individual freedom as a reason for obtaining an armored vehicle from the Department of Homeland Security. This raises concerns about the potential for overreach and the blurring of lines between military and police functions.\n\nLibertarians, who generally support the legitimacy of police, courts, and military, argue that the ability to sleep securely in one's home without armored men bursting through the door is a fundamental freedom. As the public begins to question the effectiveness and morality of the drug war and the War on Terror, it is crucial to examine the role of SWAT teams and the potential for excessive force and overreach in domestic policing.",
    " Title: Education Department Proposes Revisions to Title IX Standards for College Campus Sexual Harassment Cases\n\nThe Education Department is reportedly revising the Title IX standards for addressing sexual harassment and assault on college campuses. The revisions, which have not yet been finalized, aim to bolster the rights of accused students, narrow the definition of sexual harassment, and hold schools accountable only for formal complaints filed through proper authorities and for conduct said to have occurred on their campuses.\n\nAccording to a draft obtained by The New York Times, the Department recognizes that despite well-intentioned efforts by school districts, colleges, and universities, advocacy organizations, and the Department itself, sexual harassment and assault continue to present serious problems across the nation's campuses. The lack of clear regulatory standards has contributed to processes that have not been fair to all parties involved, lacked appropriate procedural protections, and undermined confidence in the reliability of the outcomes of investigations of sexual harassment allegations.\n\nHowever, the revisions have sparked controversy, with some critics arguing that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos isn't operating in good faith. DeVos's choice of Candice Jackson to head the department's Office for Civil Rights, which investigates Title IX complaints, has raised eyebrows. In the past, Jackson asserted to The Times that \"90 percent\" of assault complaints \"fall into the category of 'we were both drunk,' 'we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.'\"\n\nFurthermore, in 2017, DeVos reached out to several men's rights groups to discuss the issue of rape on campus. The secretary met with members of Families Advocating for Campus Equality and Stop Abusive and Violent Environments, which advocate for students accused of sexual misconduct, and the National Coalition for Men, which refers to itself as \"the oldest Men's Rights organization in America.\" The latter group recently filed its own Title IX complaint against the University of Pennsylvania because the school has \"over 20 women programs... but nothing similar for men.\"\n\nThe revisions to Title IX standards are expected to have a significant impact on how colleges and universities handle sexual harassment and assault cases. The final rule is yet to be released, and it remains to be seen how the changes will be received by both advocates and critics.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Community Reports Increased Terrorist Chatter Ahead of 9/11 Anniversary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the 13th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the U.S. intelligence community has reported a significant increase in chatter among Islamic terrorist organizations. A U.S. government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Blaze that there has been an uptick in communications, both online and via phone lines, from these groups.\n\nWhile the intelligence community cannot confirm whether an attack is imminent, the official noted that similar levels of chatter were observed before the September 11 attacks. The increased chatter is attributed to the rise of the Islamic State group, which has been vying for dominance in Iraq and Syria, and has openly declared its intent to target American interests worldwide.\n\nThe threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, is twofold. First, it is in conflict with al Qaeda, from which it was expelled in February. The two groups have been engaged in an internal power struggle, with ISIS currently gaining the upper hand. ISIS has attracted a significant number of young Muslims from around the world, potentially depriving al Qaeda of its own fighters.\n\nFormer CIA case officer Brian Fairchild told The Blaze that the approaching 9/11 anniversary could potentially benefit both terrorist groups, as an attack on U.S. soil would serve their interests. \"ISIS was kicked out of al Qaeda in February and they\u2019ve been fighting each other internally for leadership,\" Fairchild said. \"ISIS is winning right now. They have captured the imagination of young Muslims from around the world and depriving al Qaeda of its own fighters. Al Qaeda is split down the middle and now you have 9/11 [ anniversary approaching ]. It would be beneficial to both camps that on 9/11, some great attack in the United States takes place.\"\n\nThe Islamic State executed American photojournalist James Foley on Aug. 19, and has used social media platforms to issue terror threats against American soil. Recently, Chicago's WGN network reported a tweet from the terror group on June 20, which included a picture taken on Michigan Ave. The tweet reads \"Soldiers of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria will pass from here soon.\" An Arabic message held up in the picture was translated \"We are in your streets.\"\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community continues to monitor the situation closely and remains vigilant in its efforts to protect American interests.",
    " Title: \"Unprecedented Profits and Constitutional Crisis: A Tale of Two Headlines\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to the ongoing political drama surrounding the Trump administration, the U.S. economy has been thriving, as evidenced by the Wall Street Journal's front-page headline on Monday, \"Profits Soar as Economy Advances.\" This robust economic growth, despite global economic challenges, has positioned the U.S. favorably should a trade war ensue.\n\nHowever, the political landscape has been anything but tranquil. The Washington Post and New York Times have been filled with headlines about the Trump family and their associates, with stories about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian source and the shopping habits of Paul Manafort, among others.\n\nThe meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian source was not unusual, given the numerous scandals and instances of wrongdoing that have surrounded Hillary Clinton throughout her public life. From the Clinton Foundation to her fundraising operation, and issues such as Benghazi, Clinton's record is one that few have matched without legal consequences.\n\nThe ongoing investigation into Russian collusion with the President, led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, has been a source of controversy. Critics argue that the investigation, which has taken almost two years to run its course, is akin to the Clintons' meddling in the American presidential election.\n\nThe origins of this Constitutional crisis can be traced back to Hillary Clinton's anger and frustration following her unexpected defeat in the 2016 election, as revealed in the book \"Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign.\" In the aftermath of her loss, Clinton directed her aides to assemble her communications team to engineer the case that the election was not entirely on the up and up, with Russian hacking being the centerpiece of the argument.\n\nWhile the book provides a starting point for understanding the current political climate, the full story is more complex. The ongoing investigation, the media's role, and the actions of the Democratic Party have raised questions about the legitimacy of the 2016 election and the motives behind the ongoing investigation. As the investigation continues, the nation waits to see how this Constitutional crisis will unfold.",
    " Title: A Closer Look at Capitalism: An Examination of Pope Francis' Critique and the Role of Profits\n\nIn his latest apostolic exhortation, Pope Francis has taken aim at free market capitalism, arguing that it is not the panacea for global justice and inclusiveness. He has labeled unfettered capitalism as a \"new tyranny.\" This article aims to provide a balanced perspective on the pope's critique and the role of profits in capitalism.\n\nWhile it is true that capitalism, compared to heaven or a utopia, may fall short, it is essential to consider that capitalism is a practical system among the alternatives that exist on earth. For the common man, capitalism has proven superior in meeting everyday needs and desires.\n\nCapitalism, a relatively new economic system in human history, has revolutionized the way wealth is created. Prior to capitalism, wealth was primarily amassed through looting, plundering, and enslaving fellow humans. With the advent of capitalism, wealth could be accumulated by serving and pleasing one's fellow man. Capitalists aim to discover what people want, produce, and market it as efficiently as possible to generate profit. Examples such as J.D. Rockefeller, whose successful marketing of kerosene lowered prices, and Henry Ford, who made cars affordable for the common man, demonstrate the positive impact of capitalism on everyday life.\n\nThe question arises: Are those who, through their actions, have created unprecedented convenience, longer life expectancy, and a more pleasant life for the ordinary person, while becoming wealthy in the process, deserving of the scorn and ridicule heaped upon them by intellectuals, politicians, and now the pope?\n\nProfits play a crucial role in guiding resources to their highest-valued uses and satisfying people. A survey might reveal that profit-making enterprises, such as supermarkets, theaters, clothing stores, and computer stores, are more satisfying than services provided by nonprofit government organizations, such as public schools, post offices, and departments of motor vehicles.\n\nProfits force entrepreneurs to find ways to please people in the most efficient ways or face bankruptcy. Nonprofits, on the other hand, have an easier time of it, as they continue to operate regardless of their effectiveness or popularity, often relying on coercive property taxes for compensation.\n\nArthur C. Brooks, president at the American Enterprise Institute and author of \"Who Really Cares,\" has shown that Americans are the most generous people on earth. Generosity, it seems, is more prevalent in countries closer to the free market end of the economic spectrum than to the socialist or communist end. Given Pope Francis' emphasis on charity as a key aspect of godliness, it is worth reconsidering the demonization of capitalism.",
    " Title: The New York Times Faces Criticism Over Interpretation of James Hodgkinson's Motives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the congressional shooting last week, the New York Times has faced criticism for a story that seemingly attempted to redefine the motives of the lone gunman, James Hodgkinson. The shooting, which left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) gravely injured, has been widely believed to be a result of hyper-partisan politics.\n\nWhile the exact motive behind the attack may never be known, the evidence points towards partisan hatred as a significant factor. Hodgkinson's social media postings, which emerged after authorities confirmed his identity as the shooter, revealed a clear political stance: Hodgkinson was a staunch supporter of progressive politics and had a deep-seated hatred for President Donald Trump and the Republican party.\n\nHowever, on Saturday, the Times published a story with a different narrative. The headline, \"Before the Gunfire in Virginia, a Volatile Home Life in Illinois,\" suggests that Hodgkinson's personal life, rather than his political beliefs, may have been a primary factor in his actions.\n\nThe story delves into Hodgkinson's life as a foster parent, detailing instances of domestic abuse and the suicide of one foster child. It also suggests that Hodgkinson may have suffered from some form of mental illness, implying that his political beliefs had \"little\" to do with his targeting of only congressional Republicans.\n\nThis narrative has been met with criticism from various quarters, with some accusing the Times of trying to obscure Hodgkinson's political motives. Tweets from several users, including Caroline Arnold, Mike Stewart, Ivan Alaska, and JR Hansen, express their disapproval of the story, claiming it downplays the political aspect of the shooting and attempts to whitewash Hodgkinson's ideological beliefs.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the Times does not always shy away from highlighting the ideological beliefs of individuals who commit atrocities. For instance, in the case of the racist man who killed two people on a Portland commuter train, the Times emphasized his racist and anti-Muslim views.\n\nIn conclusion, the controversy surrounding the Times' story on James Hodgkinson's motives underscores the importance of balanced and unbiased reporting in the aftermath of tragic events. While it is crucial to understand the personal background of the perpetrator, it is equally important to acknowledge and report the political context in which such events occur.",
    " Title: FBI Documents Reveal Hillary Clinton's Alleged Misstatement Regarding Email Advice from Colin Powell\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, FBI documents handed over to Congress this week have revealed that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told investigators that her Republican predecessor, Colin Powell, advised her to use a personal email account. However, Powell soon issued a statement that he could recall no such conversation.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Clinton's seemingly false statement was made during a three-and-a-half-hour interview with FBI agents in early July. The alleged conversation between Clinton and Powell, as reported by journalist Joe Conason in his upcoming book \"Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton,\" took place at a small dinner party hosted by Madeleine Albright, another former secretary of state, at her home in Washington. Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice also attended.\n\nConason's book describes a conversation in the early months of Clinton's tenure at the State Department, where Albright asked all the former secretaries to offer one piece of counsel to the nation's next top diplomat. Powell reportedly advised Clinton to use her own email, as he had done, for unclassified communications, with classified communications sent and received via a State Department computer.\n\nIt is important to note that Clinton has not publicly claimed that Powell told her to use private email. The Times notes that the efforts by Clinton and her supporters to compare her server scheme to the use of private email by earlier Secretaries of State are questionable.\n\nPowell's office released a statement on Thursday night, stating that he had no recollection of the dinner conversation. The statement also mentioned that Powell may have written Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal email account for unclassified messages and how it improved communications within the State Department.\n\nHowever, Powell's use of personal email and Clinton's aren't entirely parallel. Powell did not have a server at his house or rely on outside contractors, as Clinton did at her home in Chappaqua, NY. A State Department inspector general report released in May stated that Powell and other senior officials had used personal email accounts for official business, but by the time Clinton took office, the rules were clear that using a private server in such a manner was neither allowed nor encouraged due to \"significant security risks.\"\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has criticized the FBI for allegedly improperly limiting access to its files, creating an unusual situation where Hillary Clinton cannot be prosecuted for her actions, but congressional staffers who discuss her actions will be prosecuted.\n\nClinton's campaign communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, responded to the allegations, stating, \"Would remind all that this material is classified. So this is leaking of classified material.\" However, the officials seemed less concerned about the safeguarding of classified information when it was housed on a private server owned by Clinton. Indeed, Palmieri denied the existence of such emails.\n\nAs the FBI continues to release documents, it remains to be seen how this development will impact the ongoing discussions surrounding Clinton's email practices during her tenure as Secretary of State.",
    " Title: The Bubble: Trump's Executive Order on Family Separation Met with Skepticism from Liberals and Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a swift turn of events, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to end the controversial policy of family separation at the U.S.-Mexico border. However, the move has been met with skepticism and criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, with liberals questioning the order's effectiveness and conservatives accusing Democrats of politicizing the issue.\n\nEach week, \u2588\u2588\u2588's OnPolitics blog takes a look at how media from the left and the right reacted to a political news story, giving liberals and conservatives a peek into the other's media bubble. This week, commentators reacted to President Trump's decision to issue an executive order to end his own immigration policy that involves separating families.\n\nLiberals were unsparing in their attacks on the policy, which they called \"cruel and inhumane.\" Many criticized the order as merely swapping family separation for jailing children, with some going as far as to compare the situation to Nazi death camps.\n\nConservatives were also critical of Trump's policy and his handling of the controversy. However, they also attacked Democrats for refusing to compromise on immigration, with some accusing those on the left of not wanting the separations to stop because they wanted to continue using the issue as a political football.\n\nCNN's Chris Cillizza described Trump's shift on his immigration policy as a \"fundamental miscalculation.\" Being \"tough\" on immigration is not a political positive when it leads to images of kids being ripped from their parents, Cillizza said. He added that Trump's strategic decision to cast the border crisis as something that was not his fault and that he was powerless to fix was not true.\n\nRadio host Rush Limbaugh said the media and Democrats would react to Trump's executive order by both triumphantly crying that they forced Trump to \"cave\" on the issue while also backing legal challenges to keep the issue alive. Limbaugh accused Democrats of not caring about the children and using them as political pawns.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in a New York Times op-ed that the Trump administration's inhumane treatment of immigrant children has left a \"dark stain\" on the history of the nation. He called the executive order a \"no solution at all\" and said it still leaves open the long-term detention of immigrant children and the potential for irreparable harm to those children who were used as pawns in the president's political agenda.\n\nThe Federalist's David Harsanyi conceded that family separation is \"callous and ineffective,\" but he said the Democrats' defense of the policy and their unwillingness to make any compromise on the issue is \"ginned-up moral panic, pious grandstanding, and comparisons to Nazi death camps.\"\n\nWith this executive order, the policy of separating families appears to cease. However, child internment will continue, with families together as prisoners in federal custody. Young children will still be locked in \"tender age\" camps, asylum-seekers will still be criminalized as dangers and threats to national integrity, and there is still the matter of those children already separated from their parents.\n\nIn conclusion, the executive order ending family separation at the U.S.-Mexico border has been met with skepticism and criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. While the policy of separating families appears to cease, the long-term detention of immigrant children and the potential for irreparable harm to those children who were already separated remains a contentious issue.",
    " Title: Reflecting on Two Decades of U.S. Involvement in Afghanistan: A Historical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the annals of history, the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan may be seen as a mirror image of other great powers that have attempted to exert influence in the country's rugged terrain. Historians might conclude that, much like the British, the Soviet Union, and potentially the United States, these powers found themselves frustrated, stalemated, and reluctant to bear the significant costs associated with their presence.\n\nThe British withdrawal in 1842, marked by 4,500 casualties and preceded by massacres, was a precursor to the invention of the roadside bomb. They relinquished their sovereignty over Afghanistan in 1919, signaling the beginning of the unraveling of their empire. The Soviet Union departed in 1989, concluding a decade-long effort to control the country, months before the fall of the Berlin Wall, a symbol of the collapse of the Communist superpower.\n\nThe U.S.-led operation, named \"Operation Enduring Freedom,\" commenced on October 7, 2001, following the attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a plane crash in Pennsylvania. In a speech from the Treaty Room of the White House, President George W. Bush pledged to \"win this conflict by the patient accumulation of successes, by meeting a series of challenges with determination, will, and purpose.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the country rallied behind Bush. While some cautioned against entering the \"graveyard of empires,\" the war was perceived more as a retaliatory and justice-seeking mission rather than a nation-building endeavor.\n\nThe capture of Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan in May 2011 and the diminished threat of Al Qaeda left politicians grappling to define the purpose of American troops' continued presence. Over 2,400 service members have lost their lives in combat since the invasion, according to icasualties.org. Neither President Obama nor President Trump could convincingly argue that, after nearly two decades, the U.S. had a significant role to play other than propping up a fragile democracy.",
    " Title: Elizabeth Warren's Rallying Cry for \"Nasty Women\" Amidst Political Hypocrisy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a fiery speech during her campaigning for Hillary Clinton on Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, in a nod to Donald Trump's infamous phrase from the third debate, declared, \"Get this Donald: Nasty women are tough, nasty women are smart, and nasty women vote. And on November 8th, we nasty women are going to march our nasty feet to cast our nasty votes to get you out of our lives forever.\"\n\nWarren's speech was a scathing critique of Trump's treatment of women, accusing him of disrespecting more than half the human population. \"Donald Trump aggressively disrespects more than half the human beings in this country,\" she said. \"He thinks that because he has money, that he can call women fat pigs and bimbos. He thinks that because he is a celebrity, he can rate women's bodies from one to 10. He thinks that because he has a mouth full of Tic-Tacs, he can force himself on any woman within groping distance.\"\n\nThe speech, however, raised questions about Warren's own political history, given her past praise for the late Senator Ted Kennedy, who was known for his loutish behavior towards women, including causing the death of one. Warren, in her Senate race, had called Kennedy her moral compass in politics.\n\nWarren, in her speech, spoke fondly of Kennedy, saying, \"Ted Kennedy changed my life. He changed how I understood what it is that a public servant does. I think of him in this race every single day, and I come to this convention and think about him every single hour.\" She also spoke of the \"special\" inscription Kennedy had carved on the desk she now sits at in the Senate.\n\nThe speech, however, drew attention to the hypocrisy of the political landscape, with the election of a woman who has been accused of sexual misconduct holding onto the coattails of a credibly accused rapist, Bill Clinton, and making the basis of her victory the unacceptability of a \"pig\" in the White House.\n\nCritics have also pointed out the irony of a candidate who takes money from Islamic countries that kill and maim women, supports sex-selection abortion, champions the disabled while defending partial-birth abortions aimed at them, and relies on deep-pocketed male cronies to save her from prosecution, being portrayed as a champion of women's rights.\n\nIn one of Hillary Clinton's ads, a young girl can be seen looking into a mirror, with a series of Trump's remarks about women playing in the background. The ad ends with the question, \"Is this the president we want for our daughters?\" If the young girl looked into that mirror, she would see a corrupt pol standing on the shoulders of Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy. As the parents of Monica Lewinsky could tell her, the Democrats long ago ceased to be a party safe for anyone's daughters.",
    " Title: Democrats and Republicans Clash Over Trump Administration's Proposed CHIP Funding Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on Tuesday, Democrats and Republicans found themselves on opposite sides of the aisle regarding the Trump administration's proposal to roll back $15 billion in previously allocated funding, with a significant portion coming from the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The administration's request seeks to claw back money from CHIP, a move that has sparked strong opposition from Democrats.\n\nThe controversy stems from the March $1.3 trillion spending bill, in which a majority of congressional Democrats, including House and Senate Democrats, voted to rescind CHIP funding. However, the White House argues that nearly half of the requested rescissions come from two accounts within CHIP\u2014$7 billion from funds that can't be or won't be spent under law and an additional $2 billion in contingency funds. The White House stated on Monday evening that a substantial portion of the $7 billion cut to CHIP funding comes from 2017, which has now expired.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was among the first to speak out against the proposal, setting the tone for an upcoming fight. \"Let's be honest about what this is: President Trump and Republicans in Congress are looking to tear apart the bipartisan (CHIP), hurting middle-class families and low-income children, to appease the most conservative special interests and feel better about blowing up the deficit to give the wealthiest few and biggest corporations huge tax breaks,\" Schumer said on Monday.\n\nSimilarly, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stated that her colleagues were not ready to strike a deal. \"These Republican rescissions show the hypocrisy of a GOP Congress that insists on tight budgets for children and families while handing enormous, unpaid-for giveaways to corporations and the wealthiest,\" Pelosi said in a statement to members on Monday.\n\nThe confusion arises as many of the same Democrats who are now speaking out against the proposed cuts had already voted to rescind CHIP funding not even three months ago in March. Members of Congress voted to rescind $3.1 billion from the CHIP Contingency Fund and $3.6 billion in funds provided to states, totaling just under $7 billion.\n\nThe administration's proposal has also drawn criticism from Democratic senators, who took to Twitter to express their disdain for the proposal due to its requests for cuts to the CHIP program. Senators such as Mark Warner, Tammy Baldwin, Catherine Cortez Masto, Debbie Stabenow, and Bob Casey all tweeted their opposition to the proposal, with many emphasizing the bipartisan effort that was made to secure 10 years of CHIP funding in early February.\n\nThis development comes after lawmakers agreed to a 10-year extension of CHIP funding in early February, which included $7 billion towards community health centers, $6 billion to address opioids and mental health care, and other provisions supported on a bipartisan basis.\n\nIn 2011, Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan put forth an amendment that called for the rescinding of $44 billion in unobligated funds\u2014an amount three times the size of the administration's proposal. The amendment garnered the support of 81 senators, including Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Dianne Feinstein of California, Chris Coons of Delaware, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Bill Nelson of Florida, and Ron Wyden of Oregon.\n\nGOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who is ambivalent about the president's proposal due to CHIP funding, also voted for Stabenow's amendment in 2011. The ongoing debate over the administration's proposed CHIP funding cuts promises to be a contentious issue in the coming weeks.",
    " Title: Pelosi Suggests Trump's Actions May Be Building His Own Case for Impeachment, Calls for Attorney General Barr to be Held in Contempt\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a live interview with The Washington Post on Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) suggested that President Donald Trump's actions could be contributing to his own case for impeachment due to his continued obstruction of lawmakers' demands for testimony and documents from the White House.\n\nPelosi stated, \"He's becoming self-impeachable in terms of some of the things he's doing.\" The speaker has consistently cautioned against the divisive process of impeachment, warning that it should not be taken lightly. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she suggested that Trump might be attempting to provoke Democratic lawmakers into initiating impeachment proceedings.\n\nDuring the interview with The Washington Post's Robert Costa, Pelosi noted that one of the articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon charged obstruction of Congress, but she declined to commit to a similar narrow impeachment push against Trump.\n\nPelosi also asserted that Attorney General William Barr should be held in contempt for his refusal to release an unredacted version of the Mueller report. However, she stopped short of calling for Barr's impeachment. While acknowledging the need to protect certain parts of Mueller's findings, Pelosi argued that lawmakers had tried to accommodate some of those concerns when the White House intervened.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to meet Wednesday to vote on a contempt motion against Barr for missing the committee's self-imposed deadline for turning over the full report last week. Pelosi noted that Wednesday's contempt motion did not account for Barr's refusal to appear before the Judiciary Committee last week, objecting to being questioned by committee staff in addition to lawmakers. She took a swipe at Barr's no-show, suggesting he felt \"safer in the Republican majority in the Senate,\" where he had testified the day before.",
    " Title: \"Justice on Trial: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn their new book, \"Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court,\" authors Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino offer an in-depth account of the tumultuous confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh, detailing the behind-the-scenes strategy employed by the White House and Kavanaugh's team during the height of the controversy surrounding Christine Blasey Ford's allegations.\n\nThe book, which includes interviews with Trump, top White House officials, several Supreme Court justices, and numerous others, reveals a central conundrum for Kavanaugh and his supporters. According to the authors, the team \"understood that any criticism of Ford would be treated as a smear\" and depicted as \"victim shaming.\"\n\nDespite the potential damage to Kavanaugh's reputation, the book states that the team chose to focus on his record and the allegations against him. The authors touch on some of the alleged details involving Ford, but they are also critical of the coverage of the nomination drama, particularly in the New York Times and Washington Post. They blame, in part, \"the media's irrational personal dislike of Kavanaugh.\"\n\nThe authors are particularly critical of The New Yorker for publishing the allegations of Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh who claimed that he exposed himself to her and caused her to touch his genitals. The magazine was unable to find a corroborating witness, acknowledging that Ramirez had \"significant gaps\" in her memories and that it took her six days of assessing those memories and consulting with a lawyer to name Kavanaugh. He flatly denied the allegations.\n\nThe book also discusses the allegations made by Julie Swetnick, another accuser who claimed that Kavanaugh and a friend became inebriated and sexually assaulted women at house parties in the early 1980s. The authors call the allegations \"obviously ridiculous,\" stating that \"no one could have hidden such crimes for decades, much less a man who went on to hold high-profile positions in the White House and then became a judge on the second-most prominent federal court.\"\n\nThe authors offer numerous examples of what they call \"the media's irrational personal dislike of Kavanaugh,\" citing instances such as the New York Times publishing a story co-authored by Emily Bazelon, who had already announced her opposition to Kavanaugh, and USA Today columnist Erik Brady suggesting that Kavanaugh should give up his school coaching duties because \"credibly accused sex offenders\" should \"stay off basketball courts for now when kids are around.\"\n\nThe book also highlights the support Kavanaugh received from his wife, Ashley, who reportedly sustained herself through the ordeal by praying regularly and studying the Bible. The book concludes with a lengthy speech by Sen. Susan Collins, a key swing vote, in which she announced her decision to vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Ashley made an emotional call to her husband and told him to watch it, while Kavanaugh texted her a message of thanks and promised that he would not disappoint her.",
    " Title: Congress Faces Challenges in Addressing DACA as Supreme Court Ruling Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Supreme Court's conservative majority casts doubt on the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Congress is grappling with the possibility of taking on the contentious immigration issue. With a ruling expected in the spring, during an election year, the politics of immigration are set to become even more complex.\n\nThe Senate has struggled to pass substantial immigration bills since passing a comprehensive overhaul in 2013, which was largely ignored by the House. The chamber did manage to pass a spending bill providing aid to the border this year, but internal party disputes made the process difficult.\n\nThe trust deficit between Senate Democrats and the president is a significant hurdle. Many Democrats feel burned by past negotiations, citing failed attempts at transportation, gun safety, and immigration reform. Centrist Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) expressed his frustration, stating, \"It is exceptionally difficult to make any deal that sticks.\"\n\nThe president's tweet this week, stating that a deal would be made with Democrats if the Supreme Court rules in favor of DACA, has been met with skepticism. In 2018, a bipartisan immigration proposal received support from only eight Republicans, a number that advocates believe could have been higher without the president's intervention.\n\nThe House passed legislation addressing DACA protections earlier this year, but the Senate has yet to take action. With the Senate's 60-vote requirement, any immigration bill would need either seven Democrats or 13 Republicans to cross party lines. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) bluntly stated, \"We don't have the votes in the Senate, OK?\"\n\nThe GOP, which controls the Senate, is generally more divided on the issue than the Democratic Party. Trump lost 14 votes from the Senate GOP on his 2018 immigration bill, indicating that any legislation providing a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants may be a bridge too far for some Republicans.\n\nDespite these challenges, some senators believe that Congress should begin working on a plan now rather than waiting for the Supreme Court to force their hand. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) expressed concern, stating, \"If they strike it down, there's going to be chaos.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a supporter of the 2013 comprehensive immigration bill, suggested narrowing legislation to cover only the 660,000 young people whose status could be affected by the Supreme Court's decision. Rubio emphasized the need to focus on the Dreamers, stating, \"The challenge here on immigration at large is that any limited bill is never enough.\"\n\nHowever, this time, there are more hurdles than usual. Lawmakers' primary legislative objective is to fund the government, a task that's proving difficult. Impeachment is also looming, with a trial likely to paralyze the Senate for weeks and make tackling other legislation even more challenging.\n\nThe Democratic primary is heating up, and the general election will be in full swing when the Supreme Court decides whether to allow Trump to terminate President Barack Obama's executive action protecting the immigrants. Trump has campaigned as an immigration hard-liner, and a pivot to the middle would surprise most in Washington.\n\nThe biggest problem may be securing Democratic votes for any plan that doesn't have the president's full and explicit support. The bipartisan immigration deal cut by Sens. Angus King (I-Maine) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) last year received the vote of every Democrat but three. King, who caucuses with the Democrats, stated, \"We had a bill, he could have his whole wall and DACA would have been fixed and he killed it.\"",
    " Title: Opinion: The Iowa Caucuses: A Persistent and Valuable Part of the Presidential Nominating Process\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent column for the Des Moines Register, Kathie Obradovich argues that the Iowa caucuses, despite their perceived flaws, serve a valuable function in the presidential nominating process. Obradovich acknowledges the criticisms leveled against the caucuses, but maintains that they offer a unique and important opportunity for voters to engage with candidates and make informed decisions.\n\nAccording to Obradovich, the Iowa caucuses are often seen as a nuisance, particularly by those who do not understand them. However, she argues that the caucuses are not undesirable pests, but rather perform a valuable function for the state and the country. Obradovich highlights the \"nobility\" of the caucuses in their persistence, despite efforts to crush them by other states and powerful individuals.\n\nOne of the main challenges facing the Iowa caucuses is the issue of absentee voting. In an effort to expand participation and prevent disenfranchisement, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has required Iowa, and other caucus states, to come up with an absentee voting process. However, Obradovich notes that absentee voting has long posed a problem for the Iowa caucuses due to the need to maintain the state's first-in-the-nation status and avoid trespassing on New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary election.\n\nThe DNC has expressed concerns about the security of a potential telephonic caucus process, but Obradovich argues that this is a misunderstanding of the nature of caucuses. Caucuses are not elections and should not be held to the same standards for participation or security as elections. Obradovich also points out that the DNC's concerns seem to arise from a fundamental misunderstanding of caucuses, as caucuses are not intended to be convenient and are meant to be inconvenient in order to force voters to educate themselves about the issues and candidates.\n\nObradovich concludes by arguing that the Iowa caucuses are a vital part of the American democratic process and that efforts to eliminate them would be a blow to the American dream of anyone being able to grow up to be president. She suggests that the DNC should reconsider its blanket prohibition on telephone caucuses or rethink its requirement for an absentee caucus process.\n\nKathie Obradovich is the opinion editor for the Des Moines Register, where this column originally appeared.

    " Title: A Closer Look at the Sessions-Russia Controversy: Separating Fact from Fiction\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the recent revelation that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had undisclosed meetings with Russia's ambassador, a cloud of uncertainty has been cast over the Trump administration. Initially, the story seemed to suggest collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, but upon closer examination, the narrative appears to be more complex.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Sessions, during his confirmation hearing to become attorney general, did not disclose two meetings he had with Russia's ambassador to the United States last year. This omission has sparked a heated debate, with some, like former President George W. Bush's chief White House ethics lawyer Richard W. Painter, calling it a \"bombshell of a story.\" On the other hand, Senator Ted Cruz has dismissed it as a \"nothing burger.\"\n\nUpon reevaluating the situation, I initially proposed three possible explanations for Sessions' actions: (1) Sessions was colluding with Moscow and trying to hide it, (2) Sessions wasn't colluding but forgot about the meetings, or (3) Sessions wasn't colluding but decided to lie about contacts with Russians.\n\nHowever, after a thorough review of the facts, I find all three hypotheses to be flawed. The key question is: did Sessions perjure himself, and was there a cover-up?\n\nTo answer this question, it's essential to examine the specifics of the situation. During Sessions' confirmation hearing, Senator Patrick Leahy asked, \"Several of the President-Elect's nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?\" Sessions responded, \"No.\"\n\nThis response, in light of the subsequent revelation of the meetings, raises questions about Sessions' honesty. However, it's important to note that the question asked by Leahy was specific and focused on contacts related to the 2016 election. Sessions' meetings with the Russian ambassador occurred in the context of his role as a senator, not as a member of the Trump campaign.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Sessions-Russia controversy has generated much speculation, a closer examination of the facts suggests that the situation is more nuanced than initially perceived. The key question is whether Sessions intentionally misled Congress during his confirmation hearing, and that remains to be determined. The investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is ongoing, and it's crucial that all parties involved cooperate fully to ensure transparency and accountability.",
    " Title: Iran's Foreign Minister Expresses Assumptions on US Withdrawal from Nuclear Deal, Threatens to Abandon Limitations\n\nArticle:\n\nIran's Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has expressed his assumption that the United States will withdraw from the international nuclear deal, restricting Iran's nuclear activities. In an interview with two British newspapers, the Financial Times and the Guardian, Zarif expressed hope that Europe would maintain the agreement.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, a critic of the deal, is expected to announce next month whether he believes Iran has complied with the agreement's terms. If Trump determines that Iran has not adhered to the agreement, US Congress will initiate the process of reimposing sanctions on Iran. Trump previously described the agreement as an \"embarrassment\" in a speech to the United Nations this month.\n\nFrance, Germany, and the UK, which, along with Russia and China, signed the deal, have recently defended it. If the deal collapses, Iran would no longer be bound by its limitations on uranium enrichment, centrifuge numbers, and the production of plutonium, according to Zarif. However, he insisted that Iran would only use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\n\n\"You either live by it [the deal] or you set it aside,\" Zarif told the Financial Times and the Guardian. \"You can not be half pregnant.\"\n\nZarif stated that if the deal collapses, Iran would be walking away with improved technology, as the agreement allowed Iran to continue its research and development. He criticized Trump, stating, \"I think he has made a policy of being unpredictable, and now he's turning that into being unreliable as well. He has violated the letter, spirit, everything of the deal.\"\n\nZarif added that Iran's options would depend on how the rest of the international community responds to the US. \"If Europe and Japan and Russia and China decided to go along with the US, then I think that will be the end of the deal,\" he said. \"Europe should lead.\"\n\nEuropean Union officials have stated they could act to legally protect European investors in Iran if the US reimposes sanctions. However, they have also criticized Iran over its non-nuclear activities in the region.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Resurrection of Reagan-Era Rule Aimed at Planned Parenthood\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has been met with both praise and criticism, the Trump administration has announced plans to reinstate a rule that would prohibit federally funded family planning clinics from discussing abortion with patients. The policy, often referred to as the \"gag rule,\" is expected to face legal challenges and could potentially impact Planned Parenthood, a major recipient of grants for family planning and basic preventive care.\n\nWhite House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway stated to Fox News that the administration is merely recognizing that \"abortion is not family planning, this is family planning money.\" An administration official confirmed that the Department of Health and Human Services officially filed the rule with the Office of Management and Budget on Friday.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, a target of President Trump's campaign promises during the 2016 election, could face implications due to this policy. Dawn Laguens, the organization's executive vice president, expressed concern, stating, \"The end result would make it impossible for women to come to Planned Parenthood, who are counting on us every day.\"\n\nHowever, the administration maintains that Planned Parenthood can still receive Title X grants if they separate family-planning funds from those used for abortions. An administration official explained, \"This proposal does not necessarily defund Planned Parenthood, as long as they're willing to disentangle taxpayer funds from abortion as a method of family planning.\"\n\nThe nation's family planning program, known as Title X, serves approximately four million women annually at a cost of about $260 million to taxpayers. The policy, which was rescinded under President Bill Clinton, was originally implemented during the Reagan era.\n\nThe new proposal aims to roll back the Clinton-era requirement that abortion should be discussed as an option along with prenatal care and adoption. Critics argue that the ban on counseling women infringes upon the doctor-patient relationship, while abortion opponents claim that the federal family planning program inadvertently cross-subsidizes abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe Republican-led Congress has previously attempted, unsuccessfully, to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood. The Trump administration has pledged to continue this effort, as part of its commitment to religious and social conservatives.

    " Title: Study Finds No Significant Differences in Intellectual Humility Between Liberals and Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology has found that both liberals and conservatives are similarly motivated to avoid information that contradicts their beliefs, challenging the common perception that conservatives are more prone to intellectual isolation.\n\nThe study, led by psychology professor Jeremy Frimer of the University of Winnipeg in Canada, was inspired by a conversation with a liberal philosophy professor who expressed a reluctance to engage with opposing viewpoints. This conversation prompted Frimer to investigate the reasons behind confirmation bias and whether political ideologies play a role in the willingness to remain in ideological bubbles.\n\nThe study, which involved over 2,400 participants across five experiments, identified several issues that people are particularly keen to avoid debating, including climate change, the merits of presidential candidates, and same-sex marriage. In the case of same-sex marriage, the majority of people on both sides of the debate were willing to forgo a chance to win money to avoid hearing from someone with an opposing view.\n\nThe study's authors found that this avoidance of opposing viewpoints was not due to election fatigue or a feeling of being well-informed about both sides of the issue. Instead, participants from both sides were trying to avoid the discomfort that comes with conflicting opinions and were concerned that disagreeing with someone would damage their relationship with them.\n\nFrimer and his colleagues also found that this lack of interest in opposing viewpoints was not unique to conservatives, as the dominant view within social psychology has been that conservatives are more prone to avoiding dissenting opinions than liberals. The study suggests that both liberals and conservatives perceive themselves as being on the right side of an epic moral battle, leading to self-righteousness and the belief that their side is motivated by love and reason, while the other side is motivated by hatred and ignorance.\n\nThe study comes with a few caveats. The participants were disproportionately wealthy, well-educated, and white, and the opinions included in the analysis were ones that the subjects had already developed. Additionally, the study did not ask subjects to form a new opinion on a novel or hypothetical issue.\n\nThe study's authors also acknowledge that one side may have better reasons to want to ignore the other or be justifiably disinterested in what the other side has to say. For example, they cite the fact that Trump lied much more often than Clinton on the campaign trail during the 2016 presidential campaign and the emergence of fake news aimed at undermining Clinton's credibility as potential asymmetries in the defensibility of the two sides.\n\nRegardless of political affiliation, people tend to see their own views as unquestionably right and others' as unquestionably wrong. Frimer and his colleagues write that \"Liberals may think that conservatives' views truly are irrational, indefensible, and the product of fear \u2014 and thus not worth hearing,\" but \"a conservative might have a similar impression of liberals' beliefs, opinions, and reasoning.\" The result is a situation where \"What could ultimately be a contest of ideas is being replaced by two, non-interacting monopolies\" \u2014 a situation we are all responsible for helping to create.",
    " Title: Kentucky Senate Race: McConnell and Grimes Clash in First Debate, Accusing Each Other of Obstructing Jobs and Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated and contentious debate on Monday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes engaged in a lively exchange, each accusing the other of obstructing jobs and furthering their respective agendas.\n\nThe one-hour televised debate, the only Senate debate this season, sparked fireworks as McConnell accused Grimes of supporting President Obama's \"jobs-killing agenda\" and being complicit in the \"war on coal.\" Grimes, in turn, accused McConnell of being a self-serving Washington insider who has profited from his government job while keeping Kentuckians poor.\n\nMcConnell, who has been in office for five terms, opened the debate by stating, \"The biggest problem we've got is this Obama jobs-killing agenda that my opponent supports.\" He went on to criticize the administration's policies, particularly its impact on the coal industry in Kentucky.\n\nGrimes countered McConnell's accusations, stating, \"It's due to gridlock and the partisanship he has championed.\" She also defended herself against McConnell's attempts to link her to Obama, emphasizing that the president is not on the ballot this year.\n\nGrimes, who has called herself a Clinton Democrat, declined to state whether she voted for President Obama, citing her constitutional right to privacy at the ballot box. This is the second time in a few days that Grimes has declined to disclose her voting record.\n\nMcConnell, who has been a vocal critic of Obama throughout the campaign, accused Grimes of trying to \"deceive Kentuckians\" and \"hide her views.\" He also reiterated his opposition to ObamaCare and the president's economic recovery efforts, labeling ObamaCare as \"the worst piece of legislation in the last half century\" and calling for its complete removal.\n\nGrimes, the current Kentucky Secretary of State, emphasized her jobs plan, stating, \"My jobs plan would grow the middle class.\" She also accused McConnell of opposing legislation to help children.\n\nThe closely-watched race is considered one of the toughest in McConnell's 30-year Senate career and is among the six or seven races that will determine whether Republicans take control of the Senate. A McConnell loss would make the Republicans' task of winning back the upper chamber more challenging.\n\nBoth candidates agreed that creating jobs was their top priority, with Grimes adopting the role of the aggressive underdog. The race is expected to be the most expensive of the cycle, with millions poured in by both parties. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee recently contributed $1.4 million to Grimes, in addition to the half-million already spent on the race.\n\nAccording to a nonpartisan website, RealClearPolitics.com, McConnell, who survived a primary Tea Party challenge, currently leads by 3 percentage points. The 72-year-old McConnell would likely become the Senate majority leader if his party takes control of the upper chamber, potentially derailing the remainder of Obama's second term.\n\nGrimes has consistently stated that McConnell's conservative leadership has denied Kentuckians jobs and healthcare. Much of their campaign money is coming from interests outside of the state. Hollywood types are eager to upset a top Capitol Hill Republican, while McConnell supporters are trying to stop what they consider overspending and overreaching by the Obama administration, including the Environmental Protection Agency's crackdown on the coal industry.\n\nThe McConnell campaign and its allies throughout the election cycle have continuously run TV ads comparing Grimes to Obama. Two of these groups, Kentuckians for Strong Leadership and the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, have put down a combined $5.2 million in General Election ad time.\n\nGrimes, in response to the ad campaigns, stated, \"You and your henchmen, the Koch brothers, have misled Kentuckians with $50 million in deceptive ads.\" The Koch brothers are prominent conservative donors.\n\nThe debate highlighted the stark differences between the two candidates and the issues that will likely dominate the campaign in the coming weeks. The race will be a crucial determinant in the balance of power in the Senate and the direction of the country's political landscape.",
    " Title: Democrats' Tactics in Kavanaugh Hearing: Screaming, Whining, and Misinformation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Supreme Court confirmation hearings for President Trump's nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, Democrats have resorted to unconventional tactics in their attempts to oppose his ascension. With their limited power, they have been left with two options: protests and accusations.\n\nSenators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both vocal opponents of Kavanaugh's nomination, disrupted the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Harris called for an adjournment to review more of Kavanaugh's documents, while Booker interrupted the hearing ten times within the first 40 minutes. Other senators, including Richard Blumenthal, Mazie Hirono, Amy Klobuchar, Sheldon Whitehouse, Patrick Leahy, and Chris Coons, also disrupted the proceedings.\n\nProtests outside the hearing room were equally contentious. Women's March activist Linda Sarsour was arrested for disrupting the proceedings, while several feminist protesters dressed as characters from \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and others shouted during the hearing, leading to their ejection.\n\nIn a bizarre twist, Planned Parenthood Action tweeted, \"This is what the resistance looks like, and we're going to fight like hell to #StopKavanaugh.\"\n\nThe Democrats' second tactic was to engage in accusations and misinformation. A viral Twitter storm erupted over Zina Bash, a former Kavanaugh law clerk, who was accused of using a white supremacy signal during the hearing. However, Bash, who is half-Mexican and half-Jewish, and whose paternal grandparents were Holocaust survivors, was not making a white power gesture as claimed.\n\nAnother instance of misinformation emerged when Fred Guttenberg, the father of a Parkland shooting victim, claimed that Kavanaugh refused to shake his hand. However, it was later revealed that security had intervened before Kavanaugh could shake Guttenberg's hand.\n\nWith the political landscape increasingly polarized, the judicial confirmation hearings have become largely performative, with nominees and senators carefully avoiding direct questions about judicial rulings and philosophy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could end this circus by bringing Kavanaugh up for a vote. However, the political theater will likely continue, with Democrats maintaining their presence in the ring.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling on Affordable Care Act: Three Potential Scenarios for the White House\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to deliver its ruling on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) later this month. The court's questions during the arguments are notoriously unpredictable, but conventional wisdom suggests that the law may lose its keystone provision, the individual mandate, or even be entirely dismantled.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's administration is bracing for the decision, aiming to keep the health care law from becoming a defining issue of the 2012 election. The election, according to a top Democrat with close ties to the campaign, is expected to focus on the economy, with health care being significant only in the context of the larger economy.\n\nThe administration is reportedly preparing for three main scenarios, each with varying degrees of severity, in the event that the Supreme Court rules against the ACA.\n\n1. The court may strike down the individual mandate while keeping the rest of the law intact. This would preserve popular provisions such as covering pre-existing conditions, eliminating the \"donut hole\" gap for senior prescription benefits, and allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26.\n\n2. Another scenario under consideration is that the court could eliminate both the individual mandate and the provision covering pre-existing conditions. This would leave a fragmented law that might not function effectively.\n\n3. The third scenario, considered less likely but still a possibility, is that the court upholds the ACA in its entirety.\n\nPolls suggest that a majority of voters prefer a hybrid solution, with 51% either wanting the individual mandate struck down or the law upheld in its entirety. This aligns with years of polling showing that individual components of the ACA, particularly the ban on discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, are more popular than the law as a whole.\n\nHowever, some argue that a piecemeal approach would result in political confusion and flawed policy, as the popular provisions would not function effectively without the mandate, which provides the funding for these benefits.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision on the ACA will have significant implications for the future of health care in the United States, and the Obama administration is preparing for a range of possible outcomes.",
    " Title: Republican National Convention Shaping Up to Be a Contentious Spectacle Amidst Trump's Controversial Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican National Convention, traditionally a grand spectacle of political unity and celebration, is expected to take a different turn this year as the party grapples with the divisive and controversial nature of presumptive nominee Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nWhile the Democrats are likely to follow the conventional script in Philadelphia, with Hillary Clinton emerging as the party's nominee and the party unified for the general election campaign, the GOP convention in Cleveland is shaping up to be a contentious affair.\n\nThe convention is facing a significant challenge as numerous high-profile Republican politicians are declining to speak or attend the event. Trey Gowdy, the Republican Congressman from South Carolina, and Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo are among those who have announced they will not be attending.\n\nThe list of non-attendees is growing, with Sen. Ben Sasse, Sen. Mark Kirk, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, Sen. Lindsey Graham, Rep. Mark Sanford, and many others opting out. The reasons for their absence range from scheduling conflicts to a reluctance to associate with Trump's campaign.\n\nThe reluctance of these politicians to speak or attend the convention is not unexpected, given that a significant portion of the country (approximately 70%) opposes Trump's campaign, as noted by Stuart Stevens. Supporting Trump is a risky move for most politicians, as it could potentially damage their political careers in the long term.\n\nFurther complicating matters is the ongoing #NeverTrump movement, which is reportedly planning to stage a coup at the convention. The plan, according to reports, is to \"unbind\" the GOP delegates, allowing them to vote according to their conscience rather than the will of their constituents. However, this plan is unlikely to succeed, as the majority of delegates oppose the move and the RNC is aware of the potential damage such an action could cause.\n\nDespite the efforts of the #NeverTrump movement, their actions are likely to keep the convention awkward and potentially chaotic. With a shortage of relevant and respectable speakers, the RNC will struggle to paper over the cracks in the party's unity. The convention will serve as a stark reminder of a party divided and struggling to find a cohesive identity or a viable path to victory in November.",
    " Title: Unemployment Claims Decrease, but High Number of Americans Remain Jobless Amidst Ongoing Economic Downturn\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent report, the Department of Labor revealed that first-time claims for unemployment benefits totaled 2.1 million last week, marking a decrease from the previous week's upwardly revised 2.438 million. This figure, while lower, still indicates that a historically high number of Americans remain separated from their jobs. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had anticipated 2.05 million claims.\n\nThe decline in initial claims suggests a potential improvement in the job market, but the total number of continuing claims, or those who have been collecting for at least two weeks, remains high. The number of continuing claims dropped sharply, falling 3.86 million from the previous week, indicating that some businesses are rehiring workers as states reopen.\n\nIan Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that while the data shows progress, it may not be entirely accurate due to noisy data, particularly from California, which may not accurately represent some states' situations.\n\nThe insured unemployment rate, a basic calculation of those collecting benefits versus the total labor force, dropped sharply to 14.5% from 17.1% the previous week. Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, stated, \"Layoffs continue at a massive scale, according to the latest unemployment insurance report, but it may be that the job market is nearing a turning point.\"\n\nThe four-week moving average, which helps smooth out weekly volatility, rose to 22.72 million, an increase of 760,250 from the previous week. Since the pandemic was declared in mid-March, 40.8 million have filed claims as social distancing measures aimed at containing the coronavirus outbreak resulted in much of the $21.5 trillion U.S. economy being in lockdown for 2\u00bd months.\n\nA separate report Thursday showed that first-quarter GDP contracted by 5%, while the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker is indicating a 41.9% plunge in Q2, which would be the worst in U.S. history. This would place the U.S. firmly in recession territory, though most economists are expecting a rebound in the second half of the year after restrictions are lifted.",
    " Title: Former FBI Director James Comey Faces Scathing Criticism Over Inspector General Report\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly anticipated report, the Department of Justice Inspector General has accused former FBI Director James Comey of politically motivated actions, lying, and leaking confidential information. The report, released yesterday, states that Comey violated FBI rules, protocol, and laws in his attempt to undermine President Trump's administration through the launch of a Special Counsel investigation.\n\nThe report found that Comey failed to uphold his responsibility by not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during his tenure at the FBI and using it to create public pressure for official action. The Inspector General stated, \"In a country built on the rule of law, it is of utmost importance that all FBI employees adhere to Department and FBI policies, particularly when confronted by what appear to be extraordinary circumstances or compelling personal convictions.\"\n\nDespite these findings, Comey has demanded an apology from his critics. However, the report found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.\n\nThe report's release has sparked harsh responses from legal experts on both sides of the aisle. Democrat and George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley, writing for The Hill, stated, \"Comey is the very antithesis of the ethical leader he described.\" Turley criticized Comey for violating both federal law and regulations for personal gain and making decisions that put personal interests over institutional ones.\n\nRepublican Gregg Jarrett, writing for Fox News, argued that it is Comey who owes the American public an apology. Jarrett accused Comey of abusing his position as FBI director, violating government rules, concealing information from his former agency, leaking sensitive documents without authorization, and improperly retaining records in an unsecured location.\n\nThe report's findings and the subsequent criticism have left Comey's future unclear. However, with former colleague and fellow leaker Andrew McCabe recently hired at CNN, some speculate that Comey may not be far behind.",
    " Title: President Trump Signs $1.3 Trillion Spending Bill, Criticizes Democrats for Excessive Spending and Vows to Reform Congressional Rules\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump signed the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill on Friday, despite earlier threats of a potential government shutdown. The bill, which provides funding for various government agencies until October, includes significant investments in the military, but the president expressed displeasure over the bill's excessive spending and lack of funding for other priorities.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, President Trump criticized the legislative process that produced the bill, labeling it \"ridiculous.\" He stated, \"I've told Congress, I will never sign a bill like this again.\" The president's veto threat, which came hours before the bill's enactment, had initially startled Washington, as it followed assurances from White House officials that the president would sign the massive spending package.\n\nThe president signed the bill, he said, because of the gains made for the military. He lambasted the bill for unnecessary spending, failure to address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and inadequate funding for the border wall. In response, he called for changes to Congress's rules to facilitate progress on critical issues.\n\nThe president demanded a line-item veto for the president and the elimination of the filibuster rule, which requires 60 votes to advance most legislation in the Senate. Allowing a line-item veto would require a constitutional amendment, as the Supreme Court ruled the procedure unconstitutional in the 1998 decision Clinton v. City of New York.\n\nPresident Trump highlighted the bill's historic boost to military spending, including the largest pay increase for troops in a decade. He claimed these investments fulfilled his promise to rebuild the U.S. military into the most formidable fighting force in the world. He criticized years of defense cuts, stating, \"They hollowed our readiness as a military unit and put America at really grave risk.\" The omnibus bill, he argued, reverses this trend.\n\nThe president attributed the bill's high price tag to Democrats, who he accused of demanding extra spending in exchange for funding the military. He asserted, \"If we take something for the military, they want something that in many cases are a wasted sum of money.\" He concluded, \"It's not right, and it's very bad for our country.\"",
    " Title: Sarah Palin Responds to Martin Bashir's Resignation, Calls for Higher Media Standards\n\nArticle:\n\nIn her first comments since Martin Bashir's resignation from MSNBC, Sarah Palin has expressed her views on the matter, stating that she is \"used to\" such attacks. In an interview on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends,\" Palin discussed her thoughts on Bashir's controversial comments and his subsequent resignation.\n\nBashir, who resigned on Wednesday, made derogatory remarks about Palin during his Nov. 15 broadcast, referring to her as a \"world class idiot\" and suggesting she would be a suitable candidate for a historical act of cruelty involving slavery.\n\nPalin acknowledged that it was refreshing to see many in the media speak out against such behavior, stating, \"Those with that platform, with a microphone, a camera in their face, they have to have some more responsibility taken.\"\n\nWhen asked whether Bashir's resignation was sufficient, Palin responded that she must move past it. She referred to Bashir's on-air apology during his Nov. 18 broadcast and expressed a need to accept his apology and move on.\n\nPalin also mentioned that, five or six years ago, such attacks would have personally hurt her, but she now feels \"kind of calloused.\" She echoed her previous response to Bashir's comments and apology, stating that the attacks are often directed at conservative women and that there is an \"obvious\" double standard.\n\nPalin added that she has not heard from any feminist groups or organizations regarding the incident. This suggests that, despite the controversy, there may be a lack of support or solidarity from certain groups that typically advocate for women's rights.",
    " Title: WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange Disputes Claims of Russian Involvement in Democratic Hacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has stated that the Obama administration's focus on Russia's alleged role in the Democratic hacks leading up to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election is an attempt to \"delegitimize the Trump administration as it goes into the White House.\"\n\nAssange, who has been residing at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, claimed that the Obama administration is trying to portray President-elect Donald Trump as an illegitimate president by suggesting that Russia interfered in the election.\n\n\"Our publications had wide uptake by the American people. They\u2019re all true,\" Assange said during the interview. \"But that\u2019s not the allegation that\u2019s being presented by the Obama White House.\"\n\nAssange reiterated WikiLeaks' denial that Russia was the source of the Democratic documents released over the summer. \"Our source is not a state party, so the answer for our interactions is no,\" he said.\n\nIn December, Assange told Hannity that the documents received by WikiLeaks \"looked very much like they\u2019re from the Russians\" but emphasized that the source was not them.\n\nWhen asked if WikiLeaks influenced the 2016 election, Assange pointed to private comments from members of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign in documents published by the group.\n\n\"Did [WikiLeaks] change the outcome of the election? Who knows, it\u2019s impossible to tell,\" Assange said. \"But if it did, the accusation is that the true statements of Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager, John Podesta, and the DNC head Debbie Wasserman Schultz, their true statements is what changed the election.\"",
    " Title: Putin Suggests Consideration of Statehood for Eastern Ukraine, Blames West for Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in Russia's stance on the conflict in eastern Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has called for immediate talks on the political organization of society and statehood in the war-torn region. This marks the first time that the idea of statehood has been proposed for the region, which is predominantly Russian-speaking.\n\nSpeaking on a TV show broadcast in the far east of the country, Putin said, \"We need to immediately begin substantive talks... on questions of the political organization of society and statehood in southeastern Ukraine with the goal of protecting the lawful interests of the people who live there.\"\n\nRussia has previously advocated for greater rights under a decentralized federal system for the eastern regions of Ukraine. However, in the program taped on Friday, Putin did not directly address additional Western sanctions on Russia.\n\nPutin, in the TV show, blamed the crisis in Ukraine on the West, accusing it of supporting a \"coup\" against pro-Kremlin president Viktor Yanukovych in February. He said, \"They should have known that Russia can not stand aside when people are being shot almost at point-blank range.\"\n\nPutin has denied that Moscow has sent regular troops to fight in Ukraine, but pro-Russian rebels have claimed that many Russian soldiers have volunteered while \"on vacation.\" The West accused Moscow this week of having its troops spearhead a counter-offensive that has put Ukrainian government forces on the back foot in the nearly five-month conflict.\n\nNATO said on Thursday that Moscow had well over 1,000 troops on the ground in Ukraine and 20,000 massed by the border. Analysts, including Russian experts, see Putin as aiming to create a statelet in eastern Ukraine, much as Moscow has helped carve out de facto separatist states in Moldova and Georgia.\n\nPutin, on Friday, called the fighters in eastern Ukraine defenders of \"Novorossiya,\" or New Russia, a loaded Tsarist-era name for what is now southern and eastern Ukraine. He first used the term in April, after annexing Crimea from Ukraine, sparking outrage in Kiev and the West.\n\nDespite saying that Russia supports a negotiated political solution to the crisis, Putin has used fiery, uncompromising rhetoric in recent days. In a talk with youth activists on Friday, he compared the shelling of the rebel-held cities of Lugansk and Donetsk to the Nazi siege of Leningrad.\n\nAid groups have condemned indiscriminate shelling by both sides in the conflict which has claimed almost 2,600 lives. Putin put the blame for fighting in eastern Ukraine squarely on Kiev, stating, \"What is now happening, it seems to me, to be an absolutely natural reaction by people who live there and who are defending themselves -- they were not the first to take up arms.\"\n\nWhile people in eastern Ukraine had been concerned about attempts to downgrade the status of the Russian language, there had been no serious incidents of violence in the region until pro-Russian rebels took control of several cities in April.",
    " Title: AP Reveals Hillary Clinton's Image Control Strategy and Email Scandal Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent report by The Associated Press, emails obtained by the news agency offer insights into the meticulous image-control apparatus of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The emails reveal a behind-the-scenes effort to review introductory remarks for speakers presenting Clinton as a speaker, as well as suggesting questions that align with her campaign platform.\n\nThe campaign's focus on controlling the minutest details of Clinton's appearances, from her green room's glassware to the questions posed by local officials, has raised concerns about the potential deployment of a similar image-control apparatus in a Clinton White House. The exchanges also contradict Clinton's campaign's efforts to portray her as less wooden and scripted than in her previous run for the presidency.\n\nThe emails reveal that Clinton's campaign suggested questions for college presidents and students, such as inquiries about college affordability, an issue that Clinton has made a campaign priority. This careful planning has sometimes caused discomfort for local officials, as seen in an email from Becky Mann, the head of public relations for South Carolina's Greenville Technical College, who declined an offer from Clinton's campaign to write her introduction.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI's investigation into Clinton's email scandal has taken a new turn, with government sources telling Fox News that the recently released State Department inspector general report increases the likelihood and pressure for the Justice Department to pursue criminal charges against Clinton. The source stated that the report \"clears up confusion [about] Department of State rules and makes the IG a witness, and the people they interviewed, to her computer antics being done without permission.\"\n\nAs the presidential race heats up, concerns have also been raised about the potential national security risks posed by Donald Trump's unpredictable campaign style. Eight senior security officials told Reuters they had concerns over briefing Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, once he is formally anointed. Despite their worries, the officials said the \"Top Secret\" briefing to each candidate would not deviate from the usual format to avoid any appearance of bias.\n\nIn the midst of these developments, the Clinton campaign's handling of sensitive information and her email scandal continues to be a point of contention. RNC spokesman Michael Short stated, \"The only candidate who has proven incapable of handling sensitive information is Hillary Clinton. If there is anyone they should be worried about it is Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nAs the race for the White House continues, the email scandal and national security concerns will likely remain a significant factor in the campaign.",
    " Title: Romney Delivers Aggressive Speech, Accuses Obama of Divisive Campaign Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a fiery speech on Tuesday night, Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, delivered a scathing critique of President Obama's campaign, accusing it of running a \"campaign of division and anger and hate.\" The speech, which was personally written by Romney over two days, was the most aggressive of his bid for the presidency and set the tone for the rest of the week.\n\nDuring a rally in Chillicothe, Ohio, Romney took aim at his White House rival, citing Vice President Biden's recent remarks in Virginia that Romney and the Republicans intend to roll back Wall Street regulations and \"put y'all back in chains.\" Romney's campaign labeled the statement a \"new low,\" while Romney himself accused the president of being \"intellectually exhausted\" and out of ideas.\n\n\"His campaign and his surrogates have made wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the presidency,\" Romney told a crowd of thousands at the final stop on his five-state bus tour. \"Another outrageous charge came a few hours ago in Virginia. And the White House sinks a little bit lower. This is what an angry and desperate presidency looks like.\"\n\nRomney also mocked Obama's statements during the 2008 campaign that without fresh ideas \"you use stale tactics to scare voters.\" Romney accused Obama of now making that strategy \"the heart of his campaign.\"\n\nIn response, Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt described Romney as \"unhinged\" during the campaign speech. \"Particularly strange coming at a time when he's pouring tens of millions of dollars into negative ads that are demonstrably false,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, the Obama campaign defended Biden's comments, likening them to language used repeatedly by Republican officials. Stephanie Cutter, deputy campaign manager, said in a written statement, \"For months, Speaker Boehner, Congressman Ryan, and other Republicans have called for the 'unshackling' of the private sector from regulations that protect Americans from risky financial deals and other reckless behavior that crashed our economy.\"\n\nBiden made the remarks during a stop in Danville, Va. He took a swipe at Romney's plan to ease financial regulations, by recycling a Romney bank analogy and creating an analogy of his own. \"He said in the first 100 days, he's going to let the big banks once again write their own rules,\" Biden said. \"Unchain Wall Street! They're gon na put y'all back in chains.\"\n\nThe remark's context is unclear. Some conservative blogs claimed Biden had just made a reference to slavery. Danville, aside from being the last capital of the Confederacy, is racially split -- the city is nearly half black and half white. The crowd at Tuesday's event reflected that makeup. The Romney campaign fired back without accusing Biden of any racial reference.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday evening, however, Romney accused Obama of seeking to divide America -- whether by race, occupation, or party affiliation -- as a campaign strategy. \"But he won't win that way,\" Romney said. \"America is one nation under God. American history has been a story of the many becoming one -- uniting to preserve liberty, uniting to build the greatest economy in the world, uniting to save the world from unspeakable darkness.\"\n\nRomney championed himself as the savior of the middle class, ticking off areas where Obama and his policies have failed the American people. \"After four years, it's clear that President Obama's policies are not fixing these problems, they're making them worse,\" Romney said.",

This initiative, known as the \"Make Our Planet Great Again\" competition, was conceived by Macron in June following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the agreement.\n\nOn Monday evening, Macron will announce the winners of the competition, which was announced in response to Trump's decision. In a speech from the Elys\u00e9e Palace, Macron had urged scientists displeased with the move to \"come to France and work with us together\" on climate policy-related research.\n\nOut of a shortlist of 90 projects, around 50 will be chosen for the grants, which will be funded by the state. However, some French researchers have expressed dissatisfaction with the president's decision to fund foreign scientists at a time when funding for domestic projects is reportedly lacking.\n\nWhile the majority of candidates who entered are from the U.S., the competition for research grants was expanded to include climate scientists from other countries outside of France.\n\nMacron's attacks on Trump over the Paris agreement were widely praised by the French and international media, but the French leader's \"tough stance\" may have \"backfired,\" according to a report by The Guardian. The report suggested that the U.S. leader may have been prompted to remind people he \"was elected to serve the citizens of Pittsburgh \u2014 not Paris.\"\n\nSpeaking in the Rose Garden after his announcement that the U.S. would be leaving the Paris Climate Agreement, President Trump said that the accord signed by the Obama administration in 2015 without the consent of Congress \"disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.\"\n\n\"In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord,\" Trump said at the time, explaining that the agreement would have left American taxpayers having to \"absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.\"",
    " Title: A Political Pioneer: The Journey of Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing Democratic race for the presidency, Senator Bernie Sanders, a 78-year-old independent from Vermont, is making waves as a front-runner. His political career, marked by defying odds and challenging the establishment, has been a rollercoaster ride, as evidenced by his victories in the first states to vote.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, to Jewish parents, Sanders' humble upbringing in a small apartment instilled a class-consciousness in him at an early age. He attended the University of Chicago and participated in anti-war and civil rights activism, including the 1963 March on Washington.\n\nSanders' political journey began in 1971, when he ran for a U.S. Senate seat in Vermont as a Liberty Union candidate, a party with anti-war and socialist roots. He lost that race, as well as a few campaigns to become governor. However, his first major political success came in 1980 when he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont, beating a six-term incumbent.\n\nDuring his time as mayor, Sanders met and married his current wife, Jane O'Meara, the former president of Burlington College. Together, they have four children from previous relationships.\n\nSanders was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, making him the first independent to do so in 40 years. He served there until he ran for and won a seat in the Senate in 2007. During his time in Washington, Sanders has been a vocal critic of both Republican and Democratic politicians, often being dismissed as a gadfly.\n\nIn 2010, Sanders famously spoke for eight-and-a-half hours to attempt to block the extension of Bush-era tax policies, which he believed benefited the rich and worsened the nation's income gap. He became the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs in 2013 and helped negotiate bipartisan solutions for former soldiers facing delayed and inadequate care.\n\nSanders is known for his advocacy for social policies akin to those of Nordic countries, such as universal healthcare and paid leave for new parents. He also wants to make college free and erase all student debt.\n\nCriticism has been leveled at Sanders for his voting record on gun control, including his opposition to various forms of the Brady Bill, which required background checks and waiting periods for gun purchasers. Sanders argues that his record reflects the priorities of his Vermont constituents.\n\nIn 2016, Sanders entered the Democratic race as a long-shot candidate, squaring off against establishment favorite Hillary Clinton. Despite the odds, Sanders set fundraising records and, for a time, cast doubt on the once-seemingly inevitable nomination of Mrs. Clinton.\n\nNow, with an anti-establishment tone intact, Sanders is running on a characteristically progressive platform, featuring Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, and tuition-free public college. He is quick to note that many items on his agenda - once deemed radical - are now embraced by Democrats.\n\nHowever, some Democratic leaders remain skeptical that Sanders could win their party's nomination. This doubt seems to galvanize Sanders, who, in October, appeared to be in peril after suffering a minor heart attack and suspending his campaign. The episode reignited criticism that Sanders is too old to compete for the presidency.\n\nWithin weeks, Sanders was back, bolstered by an endorsement from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the party's liberal darling and youngest ever U.S. congresswoman. Sanders is an unapologetic curmudgeon, who, in response to a recent claim by Clinton that nobody likes him, quipped, \"On a good day, my wife likes me.\"\n\nSanders now draws crowds in the tens of thousands, making the case that the 2020 election will be won because of his principles and policy, not in spite of it. If the outsider candidate is able to clinch victory in Iowa, he may be poised to beat the odds once again.",
    " Title: Texas Abortion Law's 20-Week Limit May Face Constitutional Challenges Due to Calculation Method\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent Texas law banning most abortions after 20 weeks, making it the 12th state to enact such a restriction, may face challenges due to the method used to calculate the 20-week limit. The law, like many other state abortion bans, defines the starting point for the 20 weeks based on fertilization, not the more commonly used method of measuring pregnancy from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP).\n\nAccording to Dr. Daniel Grossman, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, and a vice president of IBIS Reproductive Health, the age of the embryo or fetus is essentially two weeks less than the number of weeks measured from the LMP. This discrepancy could cause confusion for women and their doctors and potentially affect the constitutionality of these laws.\n\n\"When we refer to the weeks of pregnancy, weeks of gestation, we measure pregnancy from the date of the last normal menstrual period,\" Grossman explains. \"For a woman who has a normal menstrual period, ovulation or fertilization would generally occur two weeks later, after the start of that normal menstrual period.\"\n\nThe use of LMP as a measurement standard developed in the days before ultrasound was widely available, Grossman notes. \"The last menstrual period was something that was knowable and was measurable, whereas it wasn't always known when fertilization took place.\"\n\nHowever, most state laws, including the Texas law, peg the beginning of pregnancy to fertilization, according to Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state issues for the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights think tank. \"When we talk about a law that bans abortion at 20 weeks post-fertilization, we're really talking about a law that bans abortion at 22 weeks of pregnancy,\" she says.\n\nThe discrepancy in terminology has led to confusion, with laws being referred to as 20-week laws when they actually ban abortion at 22 weeks. Nash attributes this to the term used in the bill becoming the headline.\n\nDespite the semantic differences, the impact of these laws is clear. The ban they would impose is earlier than what's currently considered viability, or when a fetus can survive outside the womb. \"I think there's definitely consensus that viability doesn't happen before 24 menstrual weeks,\" Grossman says. \"So when we're talking about banning abortion at 20 or 22 weeks even, that's clearly at least two weeks before the earliest point in pregnancy where viability would be a concern.\"\n\nThe constitutionality of these laws is a concern, as current Supreme Court precedent states that states cannot ban abortion before viability. However, those pushing these laws hope that by the time one of these laws makes its way to the Supreme Court, they might change their minds.\n\nSimilar doubts were raised about the constitutionality of an earlier ban, according to Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee. \"The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act was struck down by every lower federal court that considered it,\" Johnson said last week at a press conference on the federal version of the 20-week ban. \"Three U.S. District Courts; three U.S. Courts of Appeals all ruled it was in clear violation of U.S. Supreme Court precedent. But when it reached the U.S. Supreme Court, they said otherwise.\"\n\nThe ultimate number that will matter most is five\u2014the number of Supreme Court justices needed for a majority.",
    " Title: Obama Surprises National Security Team, Seeks Congressional Approval for Syria Strike\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Barack Obama has decided to seek congressional approval for a military strike against Syria, a move that reportedly took his national security team by surprise.\n\nAccording to three senior administration officials, Obama informed his advisers during a National Security Council meeting last weekend that he was considering action against Syria, but had not made a final decision. However, when Obama announced his decision to launch a limited strike against the Bashar Assad regime on Friday night, he also revealed his intention to seek congressional authorization.\n\nObama's decision to seek congressional approval was a departure from the advice given by his aides, who had advised against it. The president's reasoning for this decision was shared with his advisers on Friday night and Saturday morning in the Situation Room.\n\nThe president's decision to seek congressional approval comes after the British Parliament rejected Prime Minister David Cameron's call for military action last week, making it clear that a groundswell of international support was not forthcoming. With Russia, Syria's most powerful patron, blocking any United Nations Security Council resolution against Syria, Obama's desire for broad support for any potential action against Syria has not been realized.\n\nNotably, Obama spoke with President Francois Hollande of France, the one major U.S. ally that has endorsed a military strike, before publicly announcing his decision to seek backing from Congress.\n\nObama's decision to seek congressional approval is in line with his long-held view that the credibility of military action comes with numbers. The president is expected to address Congress and the nation on the matter in the coming weeks.\n\nCongress is set to return from its summer recess on September 9 and is expected to debate and vote on an authorization that week. Obama has not ruled out taking action immediately if Assad deploys chemical weapons before Congress is set to vote.\n\nThe officials also stressed that the president's decision to seek congressional approval was his own, and no congressional leaders directly asked him to do so. They declined to speculate on what Obama would do if Congress does not approve use of force, while maintaining that Obama retains the authority to go it alone.\n\nObama made clear in his remarks on Saturday that a \"no\" vote would send the wrong message to Assad and America's enemies. \"Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?\" Obama said. \"What's the purpose of the international system that we've built if a prohibition on the use of chemical weapons that has been agreed to by the governments of 98% of the world's people and approved overwhelmingly by the Congress of the United States is not enforced?\"",
    " Title: Partisan Divide on Vote-by-Mail Expansion Ahead of November Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - The push to expand vote-by-mail options during the coronavirus pandemic has become a contentious issue in the lead-up to the November elections. President Donald Trump and his Republican allies have expressed concerns about the potential for fraud in mail balloting, while Democrats and voting rights groups argue that it is a necessary measure to protect voters from the virus and ensure accessibility for all.\n\nLast week's turbulent Wisconsin elections, which took place despite Republican efforts to block Democratic attempts to delay in-person voting and expand absentee balloting, highlighted the partisan divide and the urgency to find a solution before the Nov. 3 U.S. election.\n\nRepublicans argue that voting by mail is more susceptible to fraud since voters do not have to appear in person at a polling place. President Trump recently stated, without evidence, that mail ballots are \"cheaters\" and \"fraudulent in many cases.\" However, Trump himself cast an absentee ballot by mail in Florida's Republican primary last month.\n\nTrump's opposition to vote-by-mail has been interpreted by Democrats as a strategy to suppress voter turnout, as they believe easier voting would lead to higher turnout and potentially disadvantage Republican candidates. Trump has stated that a shift to making voting easier would mean \"you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.\"\n\nTrevor Potter, a Republican former chairman of the Federal Election Commission who founded the Washington-based Campaign Legal Center, found Trump's reaction puzzling, as Republicans often perform well in mail-in balloting. Potter noted that older Americans, who are thought to be most vulnerable to the virus and are more likely to support President Trump, are more likely to vote by mail. Conservative states such as Utah, which votes entirely by mail, have little evidence of fraud.\n\nA series of academic, government, and news investigations over the years have found little evidence of election fraud of any kind. Utah and four other states that vote entirely by mail have reported little fraud. While there have been scattered incidents of \"ballot harvesting,\" where people collect and manipulate absentee ballots, these instances are rare.\n\nMore than a dozen states have already postponed primaries or expanded vote-by-mail to avoid crowded polling places. Vote-by-mail was used by about one-quarter of all voters in the 2018 midterm elections, according to a report by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Along with the five states that vote entirely by mail, 28 states will allow voters to request a mail ballot without any excuse in November, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, co-sponsor of a bill to expand vote-by-mail and early voting to all states, stated that the expansion is not a novelty, but rather an upscaling of what is already taking place. There are still 17 states, such as Texas, New York, and Louisiana, that would need to change their policies to guarantee that everyone who wants to vote by mail in November can, the Brennan Center said.\n\nThe cost of ensuring that vote-by-mail is available for all voters could be up to $1.4 billion, with postage alone costing up to $600 million. Even advocates of vote-by-mail acknowledge that states should keep the option of in-person voting for voters with disabilities, those who need language access assistance, or those who do not have regular mail access.\n\nDemocratic and Republican-aligned groups across the country are already engaged in legal battles over whether and how to expand access to mail-in voting. In New Mexico, county clerks have petitioned the state Supreme Court to conduct their June 2 primary almost entirely by mail and allow all voters to be mailed an absentee ballot. State Republicans have sued to oppose both changes. In Texas, the Democratic Party sued the state's Republican leadership in federal court to allow no-excuse absentee voting. In Georgia, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Republican secretary of state for requiring voters to pay their own postage when submitting mail-in absentee ballots and applications, arguing that this is akin to a poll tax.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Disapprove of COVID-19 Protests, Poll Finds\n\nA new poll by The University of Chicago Divinity School and The \u2588\u2588\u2588-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research reveals that a majority of Americans disapprove of protests against restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. The poll also indicates a decrease in support for such measures in recent weeks.\n\nThe survey, conducted April 30-May 4, found that 55% of Americans disapprove of the protests that have taken place across the country, while 31% approve. The poll also found that 8% of Americans believe public protests, marches, and rallies should be unrestricted during the outbreak, while 41% think they should be allowed only with restrictions and 50% think they should not be allowed at all.\n\nThe poll comes as some states have begun to ease restrictions on businesses and individuals. The survey found that 71% of Americans favor requiring people to stay in their homes except for essential errands, down slightly from 80% two weeks earlier. Similarly, 67% of Americans now say they favor requiring bars and restaurants to close, down from 76% in the earlier poll.\n\nThe poll also suggested a dip in support for requiring Americans to limit gatherings to 10 people or fewer (from 82% to 75%) and requiring postponement of nonessential medical care (from 68% to 57%).\n\nThe poll found that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to disapprove of such protests, with 67% of Democrats disapproving compared to 51% of Republicans. Thirty-two percent of Republicans and 25% of Democrats say they approve.\n\nShelley Luther, a Texas hair salon owner who was sentenced to seven days in jail last week after refusing to apologize to a judge for opening her salon in defiance of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's emergency orders, was released less than 48 hours later after Abbott removed jail as a punishment for defying virus safeguards.\n\nIn Michigan, thousands of people rallied outside the state capitol last month to protest Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's restrictions. Hundreds returned two weeks later, some of them armed, to demonstrate inside the statehouse.\n\nAdam Blann, a Republican-leaning voter who works in the natural gas industry, said he doesn't personally favor the protests but does not believe they should be restricted.\n\n\"Its a tough situation,\" said Blann. \"But I also think that one of the reasons we live in a great country is that we have freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom to protest.\"\n\nThe poll also found that most Americans in favor of some kind of restriction on in-person worship, with 42% saying that should be allowed with restrictions and 48% that it should not be allowed at all.\n\nMarilou Grainger, a retired nurse anesthetist and registered Republican in Washington, Missouri, said she's torn between the need to take precautions against the virus while also allowing people to make their own decisions.\n\n\"I think we should still be under a bit of quarantine, especially people who are 60 or older,\" said Grainger. \"Did we make a mistake? Did we totally annihilate our economy, or did we actually save some people issuing this quarantine?\"\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,002 adults was conducted using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Faces Challenges in Appealing to Young Female Voters Amidst Controversial Remarks and FBI Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's comment, \"There's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other,\" has stirred controversy and raised questions about Hillary Clinton's ability to appeal to women voters. The statement, intended to support Clinton, has instead exposed a potential problem for the Democratic candidate.\n\nAn email from Clinton's campaign team, asking \"Are you by my side?\" is a question she should be posing to young women, as they seem to be the demographic she is struggling to win over. Despite Clinton's efforts to break the glass ceiling in the 2008 presidential race, it remains intact, and her chances of shattering it in 2016 appear uncertain.\n\nThe comment has sparked debate, with some outside the US labeling the situation as misogyny. However, the issue seems to run deeper than gender bias in certain circles. In a vox pop conducted at a casino in Las Vegas, during the first Democratic debate, people expressed a unified dislike and distrust of Clinton.\n\nFurthermore, the numbers from the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary reveal a significant disparity in support from young women. In Iowa, 84% of women under 30 voted for Bernie Sanders, while only 14% supported Clinton. The projection for New Hampshire shows an even more striking disparity, with 92% of young women under 30 planning to back Sanders, and only 11% supporting Clinton among women aged 30-39.\n\nThe Clinton campaign faces challenges in understanding why they are failing to win over this demographic group, who early in the campaign would have been considered low-hanging fruit for the candidate. Some speculate that this generation may feel that the gender of their next leader is irrelevant, or that they are yearning for change, with Sanders offering a socialist prescription for America.\n\nThe Clinton campaign is also grappling with the ongoing FBI investigation into Clinton's email arrangements while serving as Secretary of State. This has further fueled concerns about Clinton exceptionalism, with some perceiving the Clintons as having a unique modus operandi that is not shared by other US citizens.\n\nAs the primary race progresses, Clinton's campaign strategy will be crucial in addressing these challenges and winning over young female voters. However, recent comments from Albright, such as her statement about women not helping each other, may not help Clinton's cause, as they risk alienating potential supporters and reinforcing the perception of Clinton as an elitist candidate.",
    " Title: Federal Budget Deficit Drops Below $500 Billion for First Time Since 2008, CBO Reports\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released new estimates on Wednesday, revealing a significant decrease in the federal budget deficit for the fiscal year 2014, which ended on September 30. The deficit for the year totaled $486 billion, marking a return to the $459 billion deficit recorded in 2008, the last full year of the Bush administration.\n\nAccording to the CBO, the deficit for 2014, as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP), was 2.8 percent, slightly below the average experienced over the past 40 years. This indicates that President Obama has surpassed his self-imposed goal of cutting the deficit in half from its peak of $1.4 trillion, or 9.8 percent of GDP, in 2009.\n\nThe decrease in the deficit is attributed to a combination of reduced spending and increased tax revenue. Government revenue surpassed the $3 trillion mark for the first time in history in 2014, while spending, which reached $3.6 trillion in 2011, has decreased since then, rising only 1 percent, or $44 billion, in 2014.\n\nNew spending on Medicaid and Obamacare's subsidies for health insurance purchased on the exchanges increased by $49 billion, accounting for more than the overall increase. Social Security spending rose 5 percent, or $37 billion, while the government's student loan subsidies boosted education spending.\n\nOn the spending side, the Defense Department experienced a 5 percent cut, totaling $30 billion, and unemployment benefit spending decreased as the jobless rate declined.\n\nSpending began to decrease after Republicans took control of the House in 2011 and began to challenge President Obama's budget plans. A series of spending cuts, including the budget sequesters, helped keep spending in check.\n\nOn the revenue side, President Obama implemented a tax hike for the wealthiest at the beginning of 2013, and the recovering economy has contributed to a 17.5 percent increase in corporate income taxes over the past year.\n\nThe White House budget office did not respond to a request for comment, but outside budget analysts cautioned that the decrease in the deficit should be viewed with caution. \"While the deficit has indeed dropped significantly, this drop followed a massive increase, was largely expected, and does not suggest the country is on a sustainable fiscal path,\" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Deficit said in its analysis.\n\nThe CBO's projections from the summer suggest that $1 trillion deficits will return within a decade, and debt will also continue to grow. The long-term debt is primarily driven by entitlement spending, particularly major programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Net interest on the debt will also rise rapidly in future years as interest rates increase. However, for now, low interest rates continue to help keep the deficit down. The government paid $271 billion in interest costs in 2014, according to the CBO. Final 2014 numbers will be released by the Treasury Department later this month.",
    " Title: Hannity and Moore Face Allegations, Media Criticism in Alabama Senate Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the Alabama Senate race, Republican candidate Judge Roy Moore has found himself embroiled in a controversy following allegations of sexual misconduct with underage girls decades ago. Vice-President Mike Pence and several Republican senators have called for Moore to step down if the allegations are true, but have not specified how the women involved could prove the events.\n\nMoore, in a series of tweets, has vehemently denied the claims, stating that he is the victim of a campaign to \"silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me.\" He has also accused the media of launching a \"vicious and nasty round of attacks\" against him.\n\nOn his Fox News show, Sean Hannity, a vocal supporter of Moore, discussed the allegations extensively. Hannity, in a segment that generated controversy, appeared to call the candidate's alleged behavior with a 14-year-old \"consensual.\" Hannity later clarified that he was referring to Moore's romantic overtures to the older teenage girls, not the 14-year-old.\n\nOther conservative media outlets, such as Breitbart and National Review, have taken different approaches. Breitbart has been critical of the Washington Post report, while National Review has urged fellow conservatives not to defend Moore. Jonah Goldberg wrote, \"If you can prove it, Roy Moore will end up owning the Post after his lawsuit.\"\n\nFox News legal analyst Mercedes Colwin, during a segment on Hannity's show, claimed that women frequently make false sexual-harassment allegations in an attempt to make money. This statement drew criticism, as it did not mention the many women who had accused former Fox News executives Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment.\n\nThe controversy has sparked a debate within the Republican Party and the conservative media, with some defending Moore and others calling for him to step down. The race is scheduled for December 12, 2017.",
    " Title: White House Denies 'Amnesty' Claims on Trump's Immigration Plan, Proposes Temporary Legal Status for Certain Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the White House has proposed a new immigration plan that aims to address the ongoing government shutdown and the contentious issue of border security. The plan, presented by President Trump in an address from the Oval Office on Saturday, has been met with mixed reactions, with some conservatives labeling it an \"amnesty\" for illegal immigrants, while the White House maintains that it offers only a temporary solution and does not provide a pathway to citizenship.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser and the president's son-in-law, described the plan as a compromise between hard-right and hard-left factions, each of which has strong opposing views on the issue. The plan is intended to end the government shutdown, which is approaching its fourth week, and prevent federal employees from missing a second paycheck.\n\nThe proposal includes $5.7 billion for the construction of a border wall, as well as changes to expedite the deportation of illegal immigrant families and address abuses in the asylum system. In return, it offers humanitarian aid, reinstates a program that allows Central American children to apply for U.S. asylum from their home countries, and provides a three-year legal status for approximately 1 million people, including those currently under the Obama-era DACA program and those under humanitarian protections.\n\nThe plan also includes measures that both sides generally agree on, such as increased technology for drug detection at legal border crossings and an increase in the number of immigration judges to reduce the backlog of cases. The Senate is expected to vote on the plan next week, and the fate of the shutdown and workers' paychecks hinges on the outcome of this vote.\n\nWhile Democrats have criticized the bill from the left, some of President Trump's supporters on the right have expressed disapproval of the proposal's provision of temporary legal status for some illegal immigrants. The plan has been met with criticism from some conservative figures, with Ann Coulter, a prominent conservative activist, tweeting, \"Trump proposes amnesty. We voted for Trump and got Jeb!\"\n\nVice President Pence and Jared Kushner, however, have suggested that if agreement can be reached with Democrats on this issue, it could pave the way for broader negotiations on comprehensive immigration reform. Pence emphasized that the three-year legal status offered in the plan is not a pathway to citizenship, and that the plan is intended as a temporary solution to address the current impasse.\n\nThe White House's proposal represents a significant shift in the immigration debate, as it offers a compromise that addresses both border security and the status of certain illegal immigrants. The plan's fate remains uncertain, as it faces opposition from both the left and the right, and the government shutdown continues to impact federal employees and services.",
    " Title: North Charleston Police Chief Speaks Out on Walter Scott Shooting: \"I Have Not Watched the Video Since\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Walter Scott shooting incident, North Charleston Police Chief Ed Driggers has spoken out, expressing his dismay and condemnation of the actions of former officer Michael Thomas Slager. Unlike in similar cases across the nation, Driggers did not defend Slager, who shot an unarmed African-American man, Walter Scott, during a traffic stop.\n\nDriggers stated, \"I have watched the video and I was sickened by what I saw. I have not watched it since.\" This public appearance by Driggers, while reminiscent of recent events in Ferguson, Missouri; Cleveland, Ohio; Staten Island, New York; and Los Angeles, California, differed in substance. Driggers did not defend Slager, who claimed that he shot Scott after a physical altercation in which he feared for his life.\n\nThe only version of the story the world would have known, had it not been for Feidin Santana's brave act of recording the incident on his smartphone, would have been Slager's account, which, in essence, was a monstrous lie. There is no evidence that Scott tried to use Slager's taser against him, as the officer claimed; the taser was found near Scott's body because that's where Slager put it. Contrary to Slager's claims, he never feared for his personal safety during the incident.\n\nNeither Driggers nor Mayor Keith Summey of North Charleston sought to condemn Slager; instead, they distanced his behavior from the overall North Charleston Police Department (NCPD). Driggers stated, \"The one does not totally throw a blanket across the many.\" He and the mayor noted that the NCPD is composed of more than 340 officers, and the video, while horrific, told us nothing of the overall law enforcement system; it was merely a single man making a terrible mistake.\n\nHowever, the incident was not isolated, as Slager was not the only officer present during the shooting. After Scott fell to the ground, prostrate and bleeding, officer Clarence Habersham, who is African-American, arrived at the scene. His body language indicated this was not the first time he had come upon such a scene. He seemed unperturbed as he knelt down to check Scott's pulse, making no real attempt to save the back-shot man's life.\n\nThe details of the interactions between Slager, Habersham, and the third officer, who is Caucasian, are still unclear. What is clear, though, is that the NCPD was content to treat Slager's story as fact, and this was not the first time a member of the force had engaged in acts that could be described as thuggery. In the past five years, police officers in South Carolina have used their guns against 209 human beings, and they were exonerated of wrongdoing every single time.\n\nWalter Scott, a father, brother, cousin, and veteran, died after being shot multiple times with his back turned. If he lived long enough to be conscious as Slager tightened the cuffs around each of his wrists, his final moments on Earth were spent alone and enchained.",
    " Title: Kentucky Gubernatorial Race Heats Up as Health Co-op Collapse Takes Center Stage\n\nArticle:\n\nThe collapse of the Kentucky Health Cooperative, a nonprofit health plan established with federal loan dollars under the Affordable Care Act, has become a contentious issue in the tight gubernatorial race in Kentucky. The co-op's failure, which occurred earlier this month, has sparked a political debate over the health law's effectiveness and its impact on the state's residents.\n\nMore than a third of the 23 nonprofit health plans created under Obamacare with $2.4 billion in federal loan dollars have collapsed, and experts predict more failures are on the horizon. The co-op dominated exchange enrollment during the first two years of operations, capturing approximately 60% of customers in a traditionally Republican state. As a result, Kentucky residents who relied on the co-op for health coverage will now need to find new plans during the upcoming open-enrollment period, which begins on November 1.\n\nRepublican candidate Matt Bevin has seized on the co-op's collapse as evidence of the health care law's shortcomings and has criticized his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Jack Conway, for his support of the law. Conway, on the other hand, attributes the co-op's failure to \"market forces\" and argues that consumers still have more choices under the health law, with seven insurers to choose from during the upcoming open-enrollment period, compared to just three plans two years ago.\n\nThe nonprofit co-op program was designed as a compromise to appease liberals who were dissatisfied with the health care law's lack of a government-run insurance option. However, the program was reportedly undermined by funding cuts and restrictive rules that prohibited the use of federal funds for marketing and limited the types of customers the co-ops could target.\n\nThe co-op's collapse is not the only health care issue with political significance in the Kentucky gubernatorial race. The vast majority of Kentuckians who have gained coverage under Obamacare are enrolled in public programs, with over 500,000 individuals added to the Medicaid and CHIP rolls since 2013. During the Republican primary, Bevin expressed a desire to roll back Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, a stance that has led to criticism from Democrats for potentially abandoning half a million low- and middle-income residents.\n\nThe health care issue has the potential to sway voters in the tight gubernatorial race, with some political observers suggesting that the co-op's collapse could become a significant factor in the election. However, others are skeptical that health care issues will ultimately prove decisive, as voters are notoriously uninformed about the details of policy arguments.\n\nThe race between Bevin and Conway is expected to be close, with Conway currently holding a minuscule lead in the polls. The Republican Governor's Association has announced plans to spend $1.6 million on ad buys supporting Bevin in the final two weeks of the campaign. The outcome of the election could hinge on minor changes in the political landscape, particularly in an off-year election where voter turnout is expected to be low.",
    " Title: Democrat Representative Adam Schiff Implies Failed Impeachment of President Trump Contributed to COVID-19 Casualties\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC Monday night, Democratic Representative Adam Schiff suggested that the victims of the COVID-19 pandemic can be considered victims of the failed impeachment of President Trump. Schiff argued that the impeachment trial, in some instances, was \"equivalent to the number of people we lost on 9/11.\"\n\nDuring the interview, anchor Lawrence O' Donnell questioned Schiff about the timing of the impeachment trial and the onset of the pandemic. In response, Schiff stated, \"We certainly told the senators that he was not going to change, and there was no way to constrain him. That he is who he is, and he would continue to operate the way he had, and indeed, that's exactly what we've seen since.\"\n\nSchiff continued, \"We said a lot, but little did we know just how great the casualties would be. Some days we lose the equivalent of the number of people we lost on 9/11. You know, I think that there is no way we could have foreseen just how tragic his malfeasance would be in his remaining months in the administration.\"\n\nFox News' Sean Hannity previously reminded viewers in March that perhaps if Democrats had been less focused on the impeachment trial and more attentive to actual threats, more could have been done to protect and warn Americans about the coronavirus. Hannity argued that the impeachment trial diverted attention from the early stages of the pandemic, during which China lied about the virus and suppressed physician whistleblowers.\n\nAccording to Hannity, the first person with coronavirus arrived in the U.S. from China on January 21, while Democrats were in the midst of the impeachment trial. Hannity also pointed out that on January 31, the president declared a national health emergency, ordered mandatory two-week quarantines, and issued a travel ban on all travel to and from China. At the same time, Hannity argued, Democrats were still focused on impeaching the president.",
    " Title: Tulsi Gabbard Calls on Biden and Sanders to Urge DNC for Debate Participation\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) has appealed to former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to intervene in the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) debate qualification criteria, which has barred her from participating in the upcoming primary debates.\n\nIn a tweet late Friday, Gabbard called on Biden and Sanders, the two remaining heavyweights in the 2020 primary race, to stand with her against the DNC's \"transparent effort to exclude\" her from the debates.\n\n\"@JoeBiden @BernieSanders I \u2019 m sure you would agree that our Democratic nominee should be a person who will stand up for what is right. So I ask that you have the courage to do that now in the face of the DNC's effort to keep me from participating in the debates. #LetTulsiDebate,\" Gabbard tweeted.\n\nThe DNC announced that candidates must have garnered at least 20 percent of the delegates awarded thus far to make the debate stage in Phoenix on March 15. Gabbard, who has refused to drop her long-shot White House bid despite dismal results in the first several nominating states, has garnered just two of the 1,385 delegates awarded thus far, falling way below the threshold.\n\nSix states will hold primaries and caucuses on Tuesday, though it is virtually impossible that Gabbard will net enough delegates from the contests to hit the 20 percent mark.\n\nGabbard has repeatedly criticized the DNC, accusing it of seeking to undermine her campaign. She specifically cited a rule change last month regarding the polling qualifications for debates that allowed former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to appear onstage twice before he dropped out of the race.\n\n\"To keep me off the stage, the DNC again arbitrarily changed the debate qualifications. Previously they changed the qualifications in the OPPOSITE direction so Bloomberg could debate. I ask that you stand w/ me against the DNC's transparent effort to exclude me from the debates,\" Gabbard tweeted.\n\nThe Hawaii lawmaker, an Iraq War veteran, has centered her long-shot White House bid around reducing America's military entanglements abroad, but she has faced criticism over a 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad and her past positions opposed to LGBTQ rights.",
    " Title: Wall Street Braces for Tariffs as Gary Cohn Exits White House, NAFTA Talks Loom\n\nArticle:\n\nWall Street is bracing for potential tariffs as Gary Cohn, President Trump's top economic adviser, leaves the White House. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by as much as 349 points on Wednesday, but recovered most of its losses and closed down 82 points.\n\nQuincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, described the market as \"jittery.\" Investors were holding out hope that Trump would soften his vow to impose a 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% on aluminum, but the White House is moving forward with the plan. Cohn, who fought the tariffs, has left the administration.\n\n\"We expect that the president will sign something by the end of the week,\" Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday. She added that there could be \"carve-outs\" for Canada and Mexico.\n\nWall Street fears that broad tariffs could trigger a trade war that could harm the economy. Trump's tariff announcement last week caused a shake-up on Wall Street and led to backlash from top US trading partners, including Canada and the European Union.\n\nBrad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said that tariffs would \"hurt business and investor confidence, which are two of the pillars holding up the markets.\"\n\nNAFTA talks also loom in the background. Trump has threatened to tear up the 1994 trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The three countries have made little progress on a re-negotiated deal since beginning talks in August.\n\n\"The market is holding its breath and getting ready for a clearer picture,\" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial.\n\nUS companies with less investment overseas are emerging as winners from the trade uncertainty. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small companies, closed up for the fifth straight day.\n\nHowever, investors grappled with Cohn's impending exit. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs president, helped design Trump's tax cuts and was one of the administration's leading proponents of free trade. He served as a calming influence on the market.\n\n\"His departure has caught investors off guard,\" said Alec Young, FTSE Russell's managing director of global markets research.\n\nMcMillan said Cohn was seen as \"the voice of economic stability and a spokesperson for financial markets.\"\n\n\"His resignation leaves the president with a set of economic advisers largely seen as outside of the mainstream, or at least perceived as less aligned with Wall Street interests,\" he said.\n\nInvestors view Trump's choice for Cohn's replacement as a window into the president's future trade moves. They \"want to see Cohn 2.0,\" Detrick said.",
    " Title: The Reality of ISIS Threat: A Closer Look at Terrorist Activities Beyond Mainstream Narrative\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent discussions, the mainstream media has been debating the threat posed by the Islamic State (ISIS) to the United States. Some commentators argue that this perspective is a \"rush to war,\" while others question the immediacy of the threat. However, a closer examination of events on the ground paints a different picture.\n\nOn June 21, 19-year-old Brendan Tevlin was brutally murdered in the United States by a self-proclaimed jihadi, who claimed it was an act of retribution for U.S. military action against Muslims in the Middle East. This incident, which occurred in New Jersey, is one of several instances where ISIS-inspired terrorism has manifested on American soil.\n\nIn a series of suburban raids in Sydney and Brisbane, Australia, counterterrorism forces detained 15 individuals last week. Intelligence suggested that ISIS was planning public beheadings in these cities to demonstrate its reach. The plan involved kidnapping random members of the public, beheading them, and releasing the recordings through ISIS's propaganda arm in the Middle East.\n\nThe Islamic State does not need to physically be present in cities like Miami, New York, Toronto, or Sydney to pose a threat. The group's continued success in the Middle East and its propaganda serves as a catalyst for sociopaths worldwide. The Islamic State's plans for terrorism in the United States are already in motion, as evidenced by the warnings from New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton about ISIS targeting Times Square and calls for radicalized individuals to target U.S. military personnel.\n\nThe reality of the ISIS threat is a stark contrast to the White House's preferred narrative. Pretending that the threat does not exist will not make it disappear. Ignoring the facts on the ground will only lead to more lives lost to terrorism on American soil. As long as the Islamic State exists, it will continue to inspire disturbed individuals to carry out acts of terror.\n\nTammy Bruce, a radio talk-show host, author, and Fox News contributor, underscores the importance of acknowledging the ISIS threat. The Australians, who have been proactive in addressing the issue, have saved countless lives on their soil by understanding the reality of the ISIS threat. It is crucial for the United States to follow suit and prioritize national security over political correctness and leftist politics.",
    " Title: Pope Francis Navigates Political Divides with Subtlety and Humility During U.S. and Cuba Visits\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a week marked by political divisiveness, Pope Francis, the \"pope of the periphery,\" has demonstrated a quiet moral authority that has resonated around the world. His actions, rooted in personal gestures and a humble lifestyle, have transcended the historic teachings of the Catholic Church.\n\nDuring his visit to the United States and Cuba, Francis wielded his papal power with remarkable subtlety and shrewdness, navigating the two most contentious political issues in the U.S.: immigration and climate change.\n\nUpon his arrival in the U.S., Francis immediately addressed these issues, praising President Obama's proposals to combat air pollution and expressing his gratitude for being a guest in a country built by immigrant families. He later made an unplanned visit to the Little Sisters of the Poor, showing support for the nuns suing the president over the Obamacare birth control provision.\n\nIn Cuba, the pope's quiet moral authority was evident in his visits to symbolic locations and his homilies. He spoke of a \"revolution of tenderness,\" a subtle reinterpretation of one of Cuba's national themes. His visit to the Felix Varela Institute, named for a 19th-century advocate for Cuban independence, bolstered the slow-moving economic reforms in the communist country.\n\nThroughout his visits, Francis invoked symbols of both Cuban and American heritage, urging reconciliation, compassion, and pastoral service. He addressed a joint session of Congress, the first pope to do so, using four American figures\u2014Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day, and Thomas Merton\u2014to emphasize the need for lawmakers to defend and preserve the dignity of their fellow citizens.\n\nDespite his political maneuvering, Francis remained circumspect, cloaking his political forays in gentle moral exhortations. He steered clear of divisive issues such as abortion, instead focusing on the need to end the death penalty.\n\nAs Francis concludes his visit to the U.S. and moves on to the United Nations, he will continue to emphasize his main themes of immigration and climate change. He will visit Our Lady Queen of Angels School in East Harlem, a school serving poor immigrant children, and Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility in Philadelphia.\n\nProfessor John Sniegocki of Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, notes that Francis has been more attentive to the symbolism of the papacy, which resonates with people and gives more impact to his broader words and broader critiques of global systems.",
    " Title: Trump Holds Off-the-Record Meeting with Network Executives, Kicks off Presidential Transition with Mixed Signals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that signifies the beginning of the presidential transition, President-elect Donald Trump has held an off-the-record meeting with network executives and anchors at Trump Tower. The meeting, described as \"tough\" by Variety, reportedly saw Trump reserving particularly harsh words for CNN and NBC News.\n\nAccording to sources, the meeting was \"very candid and very honest,\" with Trump expressing his displeasure with certain aspects of the coverage during the campaign. He reminded his guests of their misjudgments, such as underestimating his ability to win states like Michigan, where he campaigned in the final days.\n\nThe New York Post reported a more dramatic version of the meeting, stating that Trump told CNN President Jeff Zucker, who worked with him at NBC during \"The Apprentice,\" \"I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar, and you should be ashamed.\"\n\nKellyanne Conway, Trump's counselor, described the meeting as \"very cordial, very productive, very congenial.\" She added, \"It was also very candid and very honest. From my own perspective, it's great to hit the reset button.\"\n\nThe meeting, it seems, was an opportunity for both sides to discuss media access, news conferences, and press pools. Trump is set to meet today with executives from The New York Times and other outlets.\n\nAs the 45th president, Trump's relationship with the mainstream media is expected to be adversarial, given his past criticisms of their organizations as dishonest and corrupt. However, it would be beneficial for both parties to find a way to work together, given Trump's popularity with the cable networks during the primaries.\n\nMeanwhile, a culture war seems to be brewing against Trump. Less than two weeks after his election, his vice president received a stern lecture from the cast of \"Hamilton,\" and Model Gigi Hadid mocked Melania Trump's accent and demeanor at the American Music Awards.\n\nThese entertainers and cultural figures, offended by Trump's election, are refusing to \"normalize\" the 45th president, as media and political elites are also doing. This is seen as a finger in the eye of the 60 million Americans who voted for Trump.\n\nWhile Trump's policies and appointments can be criticized, it is important to maintain a level of acceptance, even after a bitter campaign. A honeymoon period, once a tradition, now seems to be a thing of the past.\n\nIn the political arena, former Attorney General Eric Holder, who was more liberal than part of the country, asked media people paying their respects at a funeral for Gwen Ifill, \"Will you cower? Will you normalize that which is anything but?\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how the relationship between Trump and the media will evolve during his presidency. However, it is hoped that both sides can find common ground and work together for the betterment of the country.",
    " Title: Facebook Discovers Potential Russian Interference Ahead of U.S. Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook has identified and removed a series of pages and accounts on its platform that exhibited coordinated inauthentic behavior, which may be linked to the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian-based organization with ties to the Kremlin. The social media giant took down 32 pages and accounts on Tuesday, which had a combined total of 290,000 followers and had been promoting American political viewpoints and organizing events, including a protest against the Unite the Right rally scheduled in Washington next week.\n\nIn a call with reporters, Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, stated, \"It's clear whoever set up these accounts went to much greater lengths to obscure their identities than the Internet Research Agency did in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.\"\n\nIn October 2017, Facebook admitted that Russia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans during the 2016 presidential election. These accounts sometimes used Russian IP addresses and paid for advertising in roubles. The accounts removed this week used virtual private networks (VPNs) to conceal their locations and internet phone services to hide their identities. They spent approximately $11,000 (in US and Canadian dollars) on about 150 ads on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nNathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, stated, \"At this point, we don't have enough technical evidence to state definitively who is behind this, but they have shown similar activity and have connected with known IRA accounts.\"\n\nAlex Stamos, the company's chief security officer, noted that a known IRA account was a co-admin on one of the pages for seven minutes before the account was removed from Facebook. However, Stamos stated it was not clear whether this was the IRA with improved capabilities or a separate group.\n\nIntelligence agencies are in a better position to make an attribution by combining the technical details from Facebook with their own knowledge of the political motivations and goals of countries and other threat actors, according to Stamos.\n\nMembers of Congress, who were briefed by the company this week, were quick to attribute the activity to Russia. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, stated, \"Today's disclosure is further evidence that the Kremlin continues to exploit platforms like Facebook to sow division and spread disinformation, and I am glad that Facebook is taking some steps to pinpoint and address this activity.\"\n\nSome of the deleted pages included \"Aztlan Warriors,\" \"Resisters,\" and \"Black Elevation.\" The \"Resisters\" page created a Facebook event for a protest on 10-12 August titled \"No Unite The Right 2.\" Admins for the page connected with the admins of five legitimate pages to promote the event and post logistical information for protesters. About 600 users said they would attend the event, and 2,600 expressed an interest in attending.\n\nFacebook disabled the event earlier today and reached out to the legitimate admins of five other pages. The company also pledged to inform the people considering attending the protest about what happened.\n\nThere was also coordinated activity around the #AbolishICE campaign, a left-wing movement aimed at shutting down the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The activity appears to echo the Kremlin's creation and promotion of black activism pages such as \"Blacktivist\" in the run-up to the presidential election.\n\nFacebook revealed that the bad actors had created 30 Facebook events since May 2017, most of which had been scheduled over the past year. The company stated it did not know if people had shown up to those events.\n\nFacebook said it would continue to investigate the activity and share any further findings with law enforcement and Congress. Mark Zuckerberg, the company's CEO, stated, \"Security isn't a problem you ever completely solve. We face sophisticated and well-funded adversaries, including nation-states, that are always evolving and trying new attacks.\"\n\nCybersecurity researcher Lukasz Olejnik commented, \"Artificially inducing civil unrests or protests via internet platforms is a worrying development, and incorporation of Instagram is quite novel.\" He added, \"This development touching Washington indicates that concerns about European parliament 2019 elections might now be viewed in rather intriguing light.\"",
    " Title: \"Rising Concerns Over Affordable Care Act's Impact on Employment Hours\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, is facing criticism from labor unions and other critics who claim that the law is causing employers to reduce full-time employees' hours to avoid additional costs associated with the legislation. The concern is that this trend could affect millions of families across the United States.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires mid-sized and large employers to sponsor health insurance for all full-time employees, defined as those who work 30 hours a week or more. However, big labor unions, who initially supported the new law, are now expressing concerns due to the premium hikes, leading businesses to cap hours for employees to avoid offering health insurance.\n\nJason Furman, chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, has stated that there is no evidence of an adverse impact on job growth or the number of hours employees are working due to the Affordable Care Act. However, United Food and Commercial Workers Union President Joseph Hansen argues that the impact is already being felt, with workers having their hours reduced and incomes affected.\n\nAnalysts suggest that three key groups that will be hit hardest are unions, school workers, and local government workers. In states like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Indiana, school workers such as teacher aides, bus drivers, and cafeteria workers are expected to lose hours. In California, Texas, and Michigan, government workers including parks and recreation officials, librarians, and secretaries could also have their hours and benefits reduced.\n\nFast-food CEOs at Subway and Papa John's have already reported feeling the impact of the health care overhaul. Papa John's CEO, John Schnatter, estimates that the change will cost his company $5 million to $8 million annually. He expects franchise owners to cut employees' hours due to the costs of health insurance plans.\n\nWhile not everyone agrees with the critics' claims, an informal survey by NBC News found that roughly 20 businesses are cutting workers to 29 hours a week due to the health care law. However, a recent Bloomberg analysis questions the methodology used by critics, stating that the Bureau of Labor Statistics household survey data is too volatile to draw reliable conclusions from small samples.\n\nIn conclusion, the Affordable Care Act is facing criticism for potentially causing employers to reduce full-time employees' hours to avoid additional costs. While the White House maintains that there is no evidence of an adverse impact, critics argue that the trend could affect millions of families across the United States. The debate continues as both sides present their arguments and data.",
    " Title: President-elect Trump Praises Electoral College System, Reflects on Campaign at Final \"Thank You\" Rally\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his final \"Thank You\" rally of the 2016 campaign trail, President-elect Donald Trump expressed gratitude for the Electoral College system and praised the Founding Fathers for their foresight in creating a system that required candidates to campaign across the country.\n\nSpeaking at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama, Trump said, \"I never appreciated it until now. How genius it was, what they had in mind.\" He highlighted the Electoral College system as a means that required him to canvass the nation to talk directly to voters.\n\nTrump visited 17 states in the last month of the campaign, he said, and emphasized that the Electoral College system allowed him to reach areas that might have been overlooked in a popular vote system.\n\n\"If you go with the popular vote, I'd go New York State, California, back and forth,\" Trump said. \"It would be much easier. The problem is that every other place\u2014you stop in Florida, you stop in Texas\u2014you wouldn't see anyplace else.\"\n\nTrump won 306 electoral votes on November 8, with electors set to meet on Monday to officially cast their votes for the president-elect and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Democrat Hillary Clinton won 232 electoral votes, but she won the popular vote with 65.8 million votes to Trump's 62.9 million.\n\nTrump pledged to continue holding rallies after moving into the White House, stating, \"This is the last time I'll be speaking at a rally for maybe a while.\" He added, \"We've done everything else the opposite. This is the way you get an honest word out.\"\n\nTrump's choice for attorney general, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, spoke at the rally, praising the historic role Mobile played in the campaign. Sessions, who was the first senator to endorse Trump, said, \"It is just no doubt about it. The American people have spoken in so many ways in this election.\"\n\nKellyanne Conway, now a senior adviser to the transition team, also spoke at the rally, highlighting Trump's electoral victory statistics, including his win in more than 2,600 counties and 31 of the nation's 50 states. Conway noted that Trump would have won the popular vote if that had been the method needed to get to the presidency.\n\nTrump closed the event with an admonition, saying, \"Never, ever give up. I should have given up in this campaign five times. I could take you over 10 different things that happened where people would have given up. But I never gave up.\" He encouraged his supporters, saying, \"Never stop believing, and never, ever stop dreaming.\"",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Target Corporations for Taxes and Labor Practices, with Amazon, Facebook, McDonald's, and Walmart in the Spotlight\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2020 presidential race, candidates are garnering significant online engagement by targeting corporations for paying little or no taxes, according to data from High Lantern Group, a firm specializing in corporate reputation analysis. The companies are facing increased pressure to align with the Democratic candidates' visions for the future, which include offering employees a living wage, paying more in taxes, and allowing workers to unionize.\n\nTrump's criticisms often focus on tech, communications, and social media companies, with allegations that their messages are being repressed or censored, or that they are peddling \"fake news.\" The big picture reveals that candidates have criticized corporations before, but the companies facing attacks today differ from those targeted in 2016, when Wall Street was the primary focus.\n\nIn the current landscape, Amazon, Facebook, McDonald's, and Walmart have been the most-called-out companies. Presidential candidates have been vocal about their criticisms since last summer, with several 2020 Democrats marching with McDonald's workers during their strike against sexual harassment in the workplace and low wages.\n\nMatt Levy, director of issue analysis at HLG, noted, \"We've noticed that companies really pay attention when they or their competitors are called out by huge players.\" Unlike many other companies, Amazon has responded to candidates' criticisms, threatening to break up Big Tech if they become president.\n\nWalmart, in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588, urged candidates to engage with the company to learn more about its practices and initiatives before \"recycling critiques that haven't been relevant for years.\" The company added, \"From our investments in wages and training to our work on environmental sustainability, some candidates have a lot to learn about who we are today.\"\n\nInterestingly, between the lines, the finding that Sanders and Warren have led the pack in publicly criticizing companies on Twitter is not the most surprising. What is surprising is that Trump is the next most-likely 2020 candidate to publicly criticize companies on Twitter. Trump's lines of attack are not usually about a living wage or workplace safety. Twitter itself is among the top companies called out by candidates, ranking No. 8.",
    " Title: Trump's Hardline Immigration Stance Contrasts with Shifting Union Attitudes Toward Immigrant Workers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to his hardline immigration stance, President Donald Trump's recent speech in Phoenix revealed a more nuanced approach, acknowledging the presence of \"good people\" among the undocumented population. However, he warned of an impending wave of deportations, emphasizing the perceived threat of undocumented immigrants to American workers.\n\nDuring the speech, Trump pledged to begin deportations on the first day of his second term, in collaboration with local, state, and federal law enforcement. He linked his promise to carry out deportations with anti-globalist economic ideas, but also drew a direct line between the fortunes of native-born laborers and the presence of undocumented immigrants, a connection he has rarely made in his immigration-related remarks.\n\n\"While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, this does not change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers,\" Trump said. He emphasized his commitment to reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers.\n\nHowever, the globalization that Trump denounces has also contributed to a decades-long reshaping of unions \u2013 a traditional voice for workers and often vocal opponents of globalization \u2013 toward greater inclusion of immigrants, even those without legal status. This shift in union attitudes may undercut Trump's narrative of foreigners arriving to America to crowd out the native-born.\n\nLowell Turner, a professor at Cornell University\u2019s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, stated in an interview with The \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"If you have a union job, you know that immigrants are not stealing your jobs.\" He further explained that the reality around union workers shows that this is not happening.\n\nThis electoral season, Trump has seen greater support among union members than any Republican candidate in recent memory. His core support in the primaries was from white men who worked with their hands, and they tended to look favorably upon both unions and economic policies typically considered progressive.\n\nDespite Trump's inroads into the white working class, he has garnered endorsements from only two unions \u2013 those representing border patrol and New England police. His low approval among Hispanics and other minorities has likely helped ensure that the vast majority of union endorsements have chosen to remain firmly in the Democrats' camp.\n\nOne of those Hillary Clinton supporters is Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, who was the guest at a Monitor Breakfast earlier this week. Trumka expressed confidence in organized labor\u2019s ability to turn out votes for Clinton, despite Trump\u2019s inroads into the white working class. \u201cWe\u2019re probably about where we were with Barack Obama at this point with the election,\u201d Trumka said, adding that the more organized labor gets information out to workers, \u201cthe better off we get.\u201d\n\nFor much of their early history in the United States, unions viewed certain groups of immigrants with suspicion, if not outright animus. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, passed largely at the behest of the organized labor, is a prime example. The fear of job replacement faded after the passage of a 1924 national-origins quota, as immigration levels fell for several decades.\n\nWhen national reform came up for passage again in 1986, unions' focus was on winning sanctions against employers that hired the undocumented, whom they saw as potential strikebreakers. But by then, changes in unions' attitudes were already beginning. Deregulation measures had sent membership numbers reeling, and in urban areas like Los Angeles, deteriorated wages, benefits, and working conditions caused many native-born workers to abandon certain lines of low-skilled manual jobs.\n\nWhen they left, immigrants stepped in to take their place, mostly from Central America and Mexico. Union leaders in favor of organizing immigrants thought they were likely to be too nervous for collective action, but campaigns like the Service Employees International Union's Janitors for Justice, first conceived in 1985, won important victories from employers and showed unions that immigrants, including the undocumented, were capable of loud advocacy.\n\nAs those efforts were replicated across labor, especially in meatpacking, hospitality, restaurants, and other service industries, immigrants and native-born Hispanics began to exercise growing clout within the ranks. In 2000, the AFL-CIO, the largest union confederation in the country, called for an end to employer sanctions and for legal status for 6 million undocumented immigrants. The move came largely as a result of pressure from an immigrant-led coalition known as the Change to Win Federation, and it caused a sea change in thought.\n\n\"I think there was a shift in consciousness,\" says Mae Ngai, a historian at Columbia University who specializes in immigration and labor. \"Even if some of these older unions like the Machinists were not organizing immigrants, they could see other people doing it. They could see that immigrants were not their enemy, not their competition, not their enemy they had to fear.\"",
    " Title: Analysis: Obama Shores Up Chances in Final Debate, but Romney's Performance Keeps Race Unpredictable\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final stretch of the 2012 presidential race, the focus is on the upcoming election, and the question on everyone's mind is, \"Who will win?\" After the conclusion of the final debate, political analyst David Gergen shares his insights on the current state of the race.\n\nGergen, a political adviser to four U.S. presidents, believes that President Obama has strengthened his campaign following his clear victories in the final two debates. However, he also acknowledges that Mitt Romney has performed well in the debates and could potentially pull off an upset. Gergen estimates the chances of Obama winning at 53%, while Romney's chances are 47%.\n\nObama's performance in the debates has been crucial in restoring the faith and energy of his supporters, particularly those who felt he had let them down in the first debate. The President also effectively addressed key demographics, such as minorities, women, and youth, during the debates.\n\nRomney, on the other hand, has managed to present himself as a more human candidate, albeit with some inconsistencies in his foreign policy stance. His calculated strategy of being more deliberative and avoiding direct attacks during the debates has been effective in avoiding a \"warmonger\" label while also passing the commander-in-chief test.\n\nThe race remains tight, and the outcome will depend on the ground game of both candidates. Obama's campaign appears to have a stronger ground game, with a more robust field organization, particularly in key battleground states like Ohio. However, the Romney team disputes this assessment and will continue to fight for every vote.\n\nThe debates have shifted the narrative of the campaign, with voters now viewing both candidates as qualified for the presidency. Romney has gained ground on the central issues of the campaign: jobs, deficits, and growth. These factors could potentially help Romney come from behind in key battleground states.\n\nThe race remains unpredictable, and the next two weeks will be a \"wild ride\" to the finish. The online prediction market Intrade shows that the odds in favor of Obama have dropped from 74% before the debates to 59% after the final debate. The race is still too close to call, and the final outcome will be determined by the voters.",
    " Title: Gun Range Operator Near Dallas Shooting Suspect's Home Speaks Out on Gun Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nMesquite, Texas \u2014 In the aftermath of the deadly shooting of five police officers in Dallas, a local gun range operator has expressed her disbelief and concern over the incident, while also questioning the focus on gun control. Vickie Kale, who runs Gibson's Outpost & Shooting Range, is located just a mile from the residence of Micah Xavier Johnson, the suspect in the attack.\n\nKale, a certified firearms instructor, shakes her head in disbelief as she watches her customers fire rounds at targets. She questions how someone could point a gun at another human and pull the trigger, expressing her confusion over what could drive someone to such violence.\n\nJohnson, who is believed to have practiced at the range if he did so, is not recognized by the regular customers at Gibson's. If he did practice, they say he likely did so elsewhere. Dallas police have yet to release details about the type of rifle Johnson used, the number of rounds he fired, or where he may have practiced before the attack.\n\nWFAA-TV reported on Saturday that authorities believe Johnson had planned a larger attack, based on the ammunition he was carrying and his access to explosives.\n\nThe gun owners at the range, who prefer to remain anonymous, view their firearms as tools or objects of beauty. They are wary of speaking to reporters, fearing it could bring trouble to their homes or make them a target of a government they are skeptical or afraid of.\n\nIn Texas, open carrying of rifles is legal, and many firearms owners argue that the media focuses too much on the presence of guns and not enough on the individuals who misuse them. They question the lack of individual accountability and the absence of family values that teach respect for authority and obedience to police officers.\n\nAt the range, the unnamed gun owners express their frustration that their guns are often blamed for acts of violence, despite never being used against another person. Kale echoes their sentiments, stating, \"It's not the gun. It's not the car. It's the people driving, the person firing.\"\n\nJohnson reportedly learned to shoot during his six years in the U.S. Army Reserve and served one tour of duty in Afghanistan. He was a private first class with a specialty in carpentry and masonry but did not appear to have specialized training as a sniper.\n\nDallas police have yet to release a complete timeline of Johnson's movements during the shootings. He was killed by police using a pound of C-4 explosive delivered by a remote-controlled robot. During the standoff with police, Johnson told negotiators that he was upset over recent police-involved shootings of blacks and wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers.\n\nAuthorities who searched Johnson's home in Mesquite found a personal journal of combat tactics, as well as bomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, and ammunition. Mesquite is about a 20-minute drive east of downtown Dallas, and the drive takes visitors past multiple firearms stores tucked near nail salons and doughnut shops. Few of the gun dealers wanted to discuss the incident, but at least one store made it clear that President Obama would not be welcome inside its aisles selling noise-suppressors and cases of ammunition.\n\nGun-control advocates have used Johnson's attack to rally support for stricter laws, including against open carrying of firearms, which is legal in Texas.\n\nBack at the range near Johnson's house, Kale said she and her friends often remark that their guns never clean the kitchen or take out the trash, but somehow get blamed for killing other people, even though they've never fired a shot in anger.\n\n\"It's not the gun. It's not the car. It's the people driving, the person firing,\" she said. \"Why don't we talk about that?\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Clarify Interpretation of 1964 Civil Rights Act in Discrimination Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's new term has commenced with significant oral arguments on Tuesday, focusing on two cases that highlight contrasting perspectives on statutory interpretation. The cases aim to establish whether workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\nAt the heart of the matter is the question of whether \"sex\" in the Act also encompasses discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Supreme Court will revisit arguments first presented in 2017 in another case, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled that Congress, in effect, has implicitly outlawed such discrimination without explicitly stating so.\n\nKimberly Hively, a part-time adjunct professor at an Indiana community college, claims she was denied a full-time position and her part-time contract was not renewed due to her being a lesbian. The Seventh Circuit majority argued that the question is whether \"actions taken on the basis of sexual orientation\" are a \"subset of actions taken on the basis of sex.\"\n\nThe majority based their decision on the broader context of the statute, acknowledging but disregarding Congress' repeated refusals to add \"sexual orientation\" to the Act. The majority argued that they had \"no idea what inference to draw from congressional inaction.\" They also pointed out that the meaning of the phrase \"sex discrimination\" has evolved over time, and Congress in 1964 may not have fully understood the scope of the words they chose.\n\nA concurring judge argued that times have changed, and the meaning of the statute has evolved, with the word \"sex\" now encompassing both gender and sexual orientation. The judge contended that homosexuality was not a significant factor in the minds of the legislators in 1964, and since then, attitudes towards sex have broadened.\n\nThe minority, however, argued that the Supreme Court should interpret the statutory language as it was understood at the time of enactment. They contend that the terms \"sex\" and \"sexual orientation\" are not used interchangeably and that the Seventh Circuit's interpretation cannot be reconciled with the constitutional design, which requires bicameralism and presentment.\n\nThe minority also pointed out that the Violence Against Women Act and the Hate Crimes Act, which forbid discrimination on the basis of both \"sex\" and \"sexual orientation,\" and impose heightened punishment for harms inflicted because of these factors, support their argument.\n\nThe Seventh Circuit's minority concluded that, while Hively was unjustly treated, her case does not fall under the 1964 Civil Rights Act's prohibition of sex discrimination. The Supreme Court's decision will serve as a reminder to Congress and the courts about the importance of adhering to the constitutional design and the role of Congress in statutory updating.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Agencies' Assessment of Russia's Involvement in Afghanistan and Presidential Briefings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a discussion on Fox & Friends on June 30, 2020, the hosts discussed the potential involvement of foreign powers, particularly Russia, in Afghanistan. Republican Representative Michael Waltz, a guest on the show, stated that for years, Russia has been supporting the Taliban through arms, while Iran has been providing cash, equipment, and training. Pakistan has also been implicated in supporting the Taliban.\n\nThe hosts emphasized that if information about foreign involvement in Afghanistan is not verified by the U.S.'s 16 intelligence agencies, it does not reach the President's desk. The President is expected to make decisions based on the intelligence that is presented to him. If he is not briefed on certain information, he may not be aware of it. However, if he is briefed on it, he can act accordingly.\n\nThe hosts also discussed a report from The New York Times that suggested the President was briefed about Russia's involvement in Afghanistan on February 27th. It was noted that not all presidents read all of their briefings, and a briefing aide may summarize the content of the briefing for the President. Therefore, the President may not have personally read or been aware of the information if it was only briefly mentioned in his daily briefing.\n\nThe discussion concluded with the hosts expressing concern about the potential dangers of the President taking action based on unverified information, as it could lead to complications. The hosts emphasized the importance of verifying information before making decisions that could have significant consequences.",
    " Title: Christie Fundraising Tour in Florida Amidst Ongoing Political Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of a political scandal that has engulfed New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, he has embarked on a fundraising tour in Florida, assisting Republican Governor Rick Scott in his statewide campaigning. The allegations of a traffic jam in Fort Lee, New Jersey, being orchestrated as political retaliation against the town's mayor by Christie's team, have been circulating for over a week.\n\nChristie's weekend itinerary includes stops in Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach. However, the impact of the scandal on Christie's popularity remains unclear, as all the meetings are closed-door events. Accompanying Christie, Governor Scott has shown unwavering support, stating to CNN affiliate WSVN that Christie \"did the right thing. He apologized. He went to the community and apologized. And I look forward to seeing him.\"\n\nAs chairman of the Republican Governors Association, Christie will also be raising funds for the organization and networking with potential donors who could be significant contributors if Christie decides to run for president in 2016. The main political event is scheduled for Saturday night at the home of billionaire Ken Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot.\n\nLangone shared that he has been inundated with requests to meet the governor, regardless of the ongoing scandal. However, the Democrats have not been silent on the matter. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is tracking Christie's movements in Florida and has criticized the governor for the private nature of his campaign events.\n\n\"I think that means that Chris Christie does not want to answer any questions or Rick Scott does not want to be seen with Chris Christie in public \u2013 probably a little of both,\" Wasserman Schultz told CNN.\n\nLenny Curry, Florida's Republican Party chairman, countered the Democrats' criticism, stating, \"Chris Christie apologized. Chris Christie took action. He's the head of the Republican Governors Association, and he's down here doing his job, and that's raising money to make sure that Rick Scott gets re-elected.\"\n\nThe political landscape in Florida remains dynamic as the Christie scandal unfolds, with both parties offering their perspectives on the situation.",
    " Title: Trump Declares Houses of Worship \"Essential,\" Urges Governors to Allow Reopening\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at easing restrictions on religious gatherings during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump on Friday announced that new Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance will classify houses of worship as \"essential.\" The President called on governors to allow churches, synagogues, and mosques to reopen \"right now\" following their closure during lockdowns.\n\nDuring a briefing at the White House, Trump stated, \"The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now -- for this weekend.\" He added, \"If they do not do it, I will override the governors.\"\n\nThe CDC released interim guidelines on Friday for communities of faith, acknowledging the importance of worship in many Americans' lives while also warning of the potential risks associated with gatherings. The guidelines encourage the use of cloth face coverings during services, limiting the size of gatherings, and social distancing during services. They also suggest suspending or decreasing choirs and singing in church due to the potential for increased transmission of COVID-19.\n\nLast week, the CDC released new guidelines for schools, businesses, and other organizations as states reopen from coronavirus shutdowns. However, the document did not include guidance for churches and faith-based groups due to concerns raised by the White House regarding the recommended restrictions.\n\nCities across the country have been following their governors' lead on when and how to reopen. In New York City, houses of worship never closed but have been under reasonable capacity requirements that prohibit large gatherings.\n\nThe White House's announcement comes after Trump had a conference call with over 1,600 pastors and faith leaders from around the country, including Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. Trump reassured them that he wants to get churches reopened.\n\nChurches across the country had to close down due to stay-home orders necessary to stop the spread of the contagious virus. Faith leaders set up online services, and families tuned in Sunday mornings from their computers at home.\n\nSome faith leaders have argued that social distancing rules have violated First Amendment religious freedoms. Others have defied state and local rules and tried to reopen. However, other faith leaders have warned that congregating is too dangerous at this time.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has led to a significant number of deaths and job losses, and many families are grappling with these challenges while unable to seek respite in their places of worship. The White House's decision to classify houses of worship as essential is a response to these concerns.\n\nThe CDC's interim guidelines for communities of faith can be found on their website. It is recommended that faith leaders review these guidelines and implement measures to ensure the safety of their congregations during services.",
    " Title: HealthCare.gov Apology, Website Malfunctions, and Insurance Plan Cancellations: Sebelius Testifies Before Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday, taking responsibility for the malfunctioning HealthCare.gov website and addressing concerns over the cancellation of health insurance plans.\n\nSebelius apologized for the broken Obamacare website, stating that it would take another month to fix. Despite the ongoing issues, she defended the Affordable Care Act as a good deal for most Americans, emphasizing its role in helping not only the uninsured but also the underinsured.\n\nPresident Obama also addressed the controversy, using a campaign-style speech in Boston to clarify his 2010 promise that his health care program wouldn't force Americans out of their existing insurance. Obama stated that while some may be kicked off their plans, they will end up getting better deals from their insurance companies.\n\nThe HealthCare.gov website, intended to be the main way for many Americans to buy insurance from state-based health care exchanges, has been plagued by glitches since its launch on October 1. The site even crashed during Sebelius' testimony on Wednesday morning.\n\nSebelius took accountability for the debacle, stating, \"Hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible.\" This marked the first time she has answered to Congress for the website's problems.\n\nCalls for Sebelius to resign took a back seat to complaints about who knew what and when about the flawed website and stories of constituents who have lost their health care plans and could face higher premiums. Lawmakers also employed backhanded humor and personal challenges to make their points.\n\nRep. Cory Gardner (Colorado Republican) questioned Sebelius about her enrollment in a health care plan from the Obamacare exchanges. Sebelius refused, citing her employer-based coverage from the federal government.\n\nSebelius appeared to confuse the law when she told lawmakers, \"If I have available employer-based coverage, I am not eligible for the market.\" HealthCare.gov states that if individuals are eligible for job-based insurance, they can consider switching to a marketplace plan but may put their subsidies at risk.\n\nSebelius' testimony followed that of Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who testified to another House committee the day before. Both women laid some of the blame for the website's problems on the lead company they hired to help build the site.\n\nHowever, vendors have stated that the Obama administration did not test the system \"end to end\" until days before its launch, and a CMS memo revealed that the website had not completed security testing as of September 27.\n\nMaking matters worse for the administration, website problems have been overshadowed this week by concerns that many Americans in the individual market will not be able to keep their health care plans, as President Obama had promised.\n\nSebelius told lawmakers that if a plan was in place in 2010, when Congress passed the legislation, then it could have been grandfathered in as long as the companies didn't make major changes. She reminded lawmakers that the individual market covers a small percentage of Americans\u2014many are covered by their employers or by programs such as Medicare\u2014and that some consumers will gain better health plans at similar or lower costs, especially with the help of government subsidies.\n\nCommittee Chairman Fred Upton (Michigan Republican) stated that Americans are \"scared\" and \"frustrated\" with the situation because many of these people cannot use the Obamacare websites to explore their options\u2014just weeks after Sebelius and her lieutenants assured lawmakers that the federal exchange system was ready to launch.\n\nRep. Marsha Blackburn (Tennessee Republican) told Sebelius that the law is taking away a personal choice to hold a bare-bones plan. \"I will remind you,\" she said, \"some people like to drive a Ford, not a Ferrari, and some people like to drink out of a red Solo cup, not a crystal stem.\"",
    " Title: Biden's Role in Financial Reform and Consumer Protection During Obama Administration Highlighted\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent discussion, Jared Bernstein, who served as President Joe Biden's chief economist and economic adviser during his first term as vice president, highlighted Biden's significant role in financial reform and consumer protection during the Obama administration.\n\nDuring his tenure as vice president, Biden led the Middle Class Task Force, which organized a meeting five years ago to address consumer protection issues. The Obama administration's influence led to the passage of legislation that required clearer monthly statements, protected against retroactive interest rate increases, and limited the fees banks charge merchants on debit card purchases.\n\nBiden's efforts were praised by Stephen Spector, a spokesman for the vice president, who stated, \"The vice president's efforts made the administration unparalleled in its support for financial reform and consumer protection.\" Spector pointed to Biden's support for the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act, intended to protect consumers from unfair billing practices, and the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 financial overhaul legislation that provided new consumer safeguards and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe extent to which Biden can claim credit for these bills could be significant in a primary campaign, according to Bernstein. \"He was very much on the team,\" Bernstein said, \"and back then it was extremely important that not only did we pass these measures, but that they were elevated for all to see.\"\n\nChristopher J. Dodd, a former Democratic senator from Connecticut, noted that Biden, as vice president, was not necessarily a central player in the passage process. However, Dodd, a sponsor of the Dodd-Frank Act with Barney Frank, a former Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, described Biden as a \"classic progressive Democrat\" on economic issues.\n\n\"As vice president, I certainly can not think of a single instance that he was hostile,\" said Dodd. \"Biden, as vice president, was not a significant player behind the scenes\u2014for or against credit-card companies,\" added Frank.\n\nHowever, Frank also suggested that the Obama administration's record on financial issues could serve as a \"pretty good defense for Joe\" against criticism of his earlier ties to the credit-card industry, before he was freed from representing the interests of his home state.",
    " Title: Former Prosecutor Predicts Indictment of President Trump on Campaign Finance Charges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent analysis, former Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy suggests that prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are likely to indict President Donald Trump on charges related to violations of federal campaign finance laws. McCarthy, a conservative legal analyst, bases his prediction on the sentencing memo for Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, released on Friday.\n\nThe 40-page sentencing memorandum filed by federal prosecutors for Cohen highlights the president's potential involvement in the campaign finance violations. McCarthy argues that the prosecutors would not have emphasized Cohen's relatively minor campaign finance violations if they did not intend to charge Trump for payments made to two women before he became president.\n\nMcCarthy acknowledges that Trump has a strong defense, but suggests that prosecutors may be focusing on him regardless. In August, Cohen pleaded guilty and made an extraordinary statement in open court, stating that the payments to the women were made \"in coordination with and at the direction of\" the candidate for federal office \u2013 Donald Trump. Prosecutors would not have made this statement if the president was not a subject of their investigation.\n\nRudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and one of Trump's current lawyers, dismissed the legal danger to the president on Friday. He pointed to Cohen's conviction for lying to the FBI, which could make his testimony on other matters unreliable. \"You have to believe Cohen. Who believes Cohen?\" Giuliani reportedly said.\n\nJoel B. Pollak, Senior Editor-at-Large at \u2588\u2588\u2588, offers a different perspective.

    " Title: Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal's Response to Candy Crowley's Question on Gun Control Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, a former Attorney General of the state, faced a question from CNN's Candy Crowley regarding the effectiveness of the proposed gun control legislation in preventing tragedies like the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.\n\n\"How would anything in the bill, as it currently stands, have stopped anything that went on in Newtown?\" Crowley asked. Blumenthal responded by stating that amendments on both the assault-weapons ban and the prohibition on high-capacity magazines would be offered, and he intends to propose an amendment to ban high-capacity magazines.\n\nBlumenthal's response, in essence, acknowledges the limitations of the current bill and the need for further measures. This admission underscores the growing divide within the Democratic party on gun control, with President Obama criticizing gun control opponents as insensitive to the Sandy Hook victims, while Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has reportedly blocked a ban on assault weapons due to insufficient support within the Democrat-controlled Senate.\n\nCrowley's question, and Blumenthal's response, prompt a broader examination of the proposed legislation's effectiveness. This article will consider three key aspects of the bill: background checks, \"assault weapons\" bans, and magazine limits.\n\n1. Background checks: The Newtown shooter obtained his weapons illegally from his mother, who purchased them legally. Existing mechanisms for checking potential gun buyers who are determined to obtain a firearm illegally are inadequate. This is not a Republican talking point; the Vice President has acknowledged this reality himself.\n\n2. \"Assault weapons\" ban: Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook shooting occurred, has a federal-style assault weapons ban in place. The weapons used in the Sandy Hook massacre were not prohibited by that law.\n\n3. Magazine limits: Forcing a mass shooter to reload may provide a brief opportunity for unarmed victims to intervene, as occurred during the Tucson shooting. However, the likelihood of defenseless, terrified children, such as those at Sandy Hook, successfully overpowering a deranged gunman is negligible.\n\nIt is crucial to consider whether the proposed restrictions are effective, duplicative, and respectful of law-abiding citizens' Second Amendment rights. The \"if it saves one life\" argument, while emotionally appealing, should not be used to gloss over these important questions.\n\nThis article is not an endorsement or rejection of gun control measures, but rather an invitation to engage in a thoughtful, informed discussion about the potential impact of proposed legislation. It is essential to avoid hasty, ill-conceived action, as history has shown that such actions can lead to unworkable prohibitions and oversights, as seen in New York under Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\nIn closing, a quotation from the nation's foremost gun safety expert, Senator Blumenthal, serves as a reminder that the proposed gun control measures are just the beginning of the conversation: \"The Assault Weapons ban and the limitation on the size of magazines, let me say this as clearly as I can: this is just the beginning.\"",
    " Title: Trump Imposes Tough New Sanctions on Iran, Sparking Concerns Over Economic Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets, US President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to anyone engaging in trade with Iran, following the re-imposition of sanctions on the Middle Eastern country. The sanctions, which took effect overnight, are part of a broader strategy to pressure Iran into negotiating a new deal over its nuclear program and other contentious issues.\n\nThe president tweeted, \"Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States.\" He also praised the \"most biting sanctions ever imposed\" and said they would \"ratchet up to another level\" in November. \"I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!\" he said.\n\nThe sanctions, which follow the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal earlier this year, target the purchase or acquisition of US banknotes by Iran's government, graphite, aluminum, steel, coal, and software used in industrial processes. A second phase, set to come into effect on 5 November, will have implications for Iran's energy and shipping sectors, petroleum trading, and transactions by foreign financial institutions with the Central Bank of Iran.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani has criticized the US government, saying it has \"turned their back on diplomacy\" and is engaged in \"psychological warfare\" against the Iranian people. Rouhani said, \"Negotiations with sanctions does not make sense. We are always in favor of diplomacy and talks... but talks need honesty.\"\n\nThe European Union, which remains committed to the original nuclear deal, has spoken out against the sanctions and vowed to protect firms doing \"legitimate business\" with Iran. The foreign ministers of Germany, the UK, and France released a statement on Monday, saying the nuclear deal remains \"crucial\" to global security. They also unveiled a \"blocking statute,\" which is intended to protect European firms doing business with Iran despite the new US sanctions.\n\nThe impact of the sanctions is already being felt in Iran, with rising food prices, unemployment, and even poor water supplies leading to protests in a number of cities. The sanctions may bite hardest in November, when the US blocks Iranian oil sales, potentially halting about half of Iran's exports of some two million barrels a day. However, Iran may look to China and Russia to keep its industry afloat.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has predicted that Iran's net official reserves could decline this year to $97.8 billion, which would finance about 13 months of imports. Analysts at BMI Research say Iran's economy could contract by 4.3% in 2019.\n\nAs the first tranche of new US sanctions kicks in, young Iranians have been sharing their stories with BBC Persian, detailing the economic hardships they are facing. Many have lost their jobs, with some turning to alternative means of income, such as taxi driving or overtime work, to support their families. Many are also going without pay, struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe sanctions have sparked concerns that they could lead to increased unrest in Iran, but some analysts argue that such economic hardship often makes people more dependent on their government, rather than leading to its downfall. As the situation unfolds, the world watches with bated breath, hoping for a peaceful resolution to the ongoing tensions between the US and Iran.",
    " Title: U.S. Re-imposition of Iran Sanctions and the Global Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could significantly alter international relations, President Donald Trump's decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran and withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal has left U.S. allies in Europe, China, Russia, and Iran grappling with their next steps.\n\nTrump, in a statement on Tuesday, described the deal as a \"horrible, one-sided deal\" that \"didn\u2019t bring peace\" and \"never will.\" The President's decision not to re-issue the waivers required under the nuclear agreement could have a \"devastatingly chilling effect on any kind of economic activity\" between Europe and Iran, according to Tony Blinken, a former deputy secretary of State under President Barack Obama.\n\nRobert Einhorn, a former arms control official at the State Department under Obama, explained that the practical effect of not issuing the waivers is to put banks, businesses, and purchasers of Iranian crude oil on notice that they must either stop importing Iranian crude oil or make significant reductions within the next 180 days.\n\nTrump's decision to withdraw from the deal stems from his long-standing criticism of the agreement, which he has called the worst ever negotiated. He has identified several weaknesses in the deal, including the elimination of expiration dates on the most important restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity, allowing inspections of military sites, and addressing Iran's support for terrorist groups across the Middle East.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson have all urged Trump to stay with the deal and work to address his concerns. They have agreed with U.S. intelligence agencies and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who testified that the agreement limited Iran's nuclear activities for now and that Iran has complied with it.\n\nIran's President Hasan Rouhani has said his country would respond to the U.S. action, but he and other signatories to the deal have also expressed a desire to stay in it. Russia, a crude oil exporter, does not import much, if any, crude oil from Iran. China could potentially direct its oil purchases through its Kunlun Bank, which is already under U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe European Union has announced plans to protect companies if Trump pulls out of the deal, but Einhorn predicts that banks and businesses will likely pull out of Iran due to the risks associated with the U.S.-led financial system. The poor management and corruption of Iran's economy could further deter businesses from engaging with the country.\n\nStephen Rademaker, a former arms control official at the State Department under President George W. Bush, believes Trump's ideal goal is to negotiate a better deal with Iran. Even after refusing to waive sanctions and those sanctions go back into effect, Trump will still have the waiver authority, according to Rademaker.\n\nTrump's decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran and withdraw from the nuclear deal will have far-reaching consequences for the global community, particularly for U.S. allies in Europe, China, and Russia. The next few months will be critical as these nations decide how to respond to the U.S.'s actions and navigate the complexities of the global economy.",
    " Title: Opponents Ramp Up Efforts to Prevent \"Bad Deal\" in Iran Nuclear Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the interim nuclear deal negotiations with Iran continue in Geneva, opponents and skeptics are intensifying their efforts to prevent what they fear could be a \"bad deal\" that would allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.\n\nWhile it is acknowledged that neither Congress nor the vocal opposition of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can derail an accord agreed upon by world powers, attention is shifting towards ensuring immediate consequences for Iran if it fails to comply with the provisions of any such agreement.\n\nThe six world powers, meeting with Iran in Geneva, reported no progress on Thursday in narrowing the remaining differences between the two sides, with some Iranian officials suggesting that the gaps may have widened since their last meeting earlier this month.\n\nHowever, this apparent lack of progress did not deter some members of Congress from meeting with administration officials at the White House to express their concerns. At least one Republican senator announced that he was proposing legislation to reinstate any lightened sanctions on Iran upon any evidence of Iran not abiding by the terms of a first-step deal.\n\nAn interim deal with Iran would aim to freeze progress in Iran's nuclear program while a comprehensive agreement, verifiably stopping Iran's program short of a nuclear weapon, could be worked out. Opponents appear most concerned that a short-term plan accepting some level of uranium enrichment - a process that can result in the fuel for a nuclear weapon - could turn into permanent acceptance of Iran's \"right\" to enrich.\n\nJohn Bolton, the former US ambassador to the United Nations and a prominent critic of the Obama administration's Iran diplomacy, stated, \"The Iranian nuclear program has been fundamentally a weapons program from the beginning, and I don't see that changing - certainly not if we go with an interim deal that accepts uranium enrichment.\"\n\nSuch a deal, Bolton added, would be \"fatally flawed\" because, without any vision for what a final plan should look like, the risks are great that an interim accord \"becomes permanent\" - enshrining Iran's enrichment program and leaving Iran on a path to a nuclear weapon.\n\nFears that an interim deal could evolve into a permanent deal - and one leaving Iran with an operating enrichment program - prompted Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) to introduce legislation on Thursday \"to keep the pressure on Iran\" in the period between a first-step and a final deal.\n\nThe bill would defer any additional lifting of sanctions - beyond what the White House says would be \"limited and reversible\" sanctions relief as part of an interim deal - until after Iran agreed to the \"essential terms of an acceptable final deal,\" Senator Corker said. The legislation also calls for any sanctions lifted as part of an interim deal to \"snap back\" in the event of any violation of the deal's obligations, he added.\n\nIn order to secure substantial US sanctions relief as part of a final agreement, Iran would have to verifiably \"eliminate the threat of its nuclear program,\" Corker said.\n\nEven as negotiations were underway in Geneva, the White House continued to brief members of Congress in an effort to head off debilitating criticism should a deal be reached.\n\nOne member of a delegation invited to the White House on Thursday, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA), said he \"remains a skeptic\" that a good interim deal is possible. But he said he left the meeting, which he said was attended by 10 Democratic representatives, \"a little more convinced that they [in the administration] are focused on getting this right\" and not above all on getting any deal.\n\nEarlier in the day, Representative Sherman had cut short his attendance at a Capitol Hill meeting of Iranian dissidents addressing the plight of Iranian refugees in Iraq, telling a cheering crowd that he had to leave for the White House \"to convince them not to accept a bad deal in Geneva.\"\n\nAfter the White House meeting, Sherman said, \"I still fear they would be willing to enter a deal that [to them] would be better than no deal at all\" - echoing a charge leveled against President Obama not just by other members of Congress but also by French leaders, who are also involved in the Geneva talks.\n\n\"But after what I heard,\" he added, \"I'm a little less concerned about that than I was before.\"\n\nSherman said a key challenge after an interim deal - and one reason he never favored the idea of a \"first step\" before a comprehensive agreement - will be the thinking expected to bloom in international business circles \"that it's OK to do business with Iran now.\"\n\nTo battle such trends and to keep the pressure up on Iran, Sherman says he and other members of the House will continue to press the Senate to proceed with considering a new round of sanctions. The point, he says, would be to keep Iran motivated to reach a comprehensive agreement on its nuclear program.\n\nMore ardent critics of the administration's Iran diplomacy say any rush into a \"bad deal\" won't just leave Iran's nuclear challenge unaddressed, but could embroil Obama in another losing political battle.\n\nAmericans largely favor reaching a diplomatic solution with Iran, polls show, but, critics add, that doesn't mean that an Iran allowed to continue moving toward a nuclear weapon is acceptable.\n\n\"I think the administration is set on getting some deal,\" says Mr. Bolton, now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \"But if they go with a deal with such deficiencies that the opposition here in Washington is swift and sustained, they're not going to get that.\"",
    " Title: Trump Advocates for Expanded Childcare and Family Leave, Pursuing Bipartisan Effort on Working Parents' Assistance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing a key issue emphasized by Democratic candidates in the 2020 race, President Donald Trump called for expanded access to childcare and family leave during a White House meeting on Thursday. The event, arranged by Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, was part of an administration push to improve assistance for working parents and potentially move forward related legislation.\n\nTrump emphasized the need to expand childcare options and reduce unnecessary regulations, allowing parents to choose the best care for their children. He advocated for the expansion of in-home and faith-based programs for children, stating, \"We want to expand childcare options and reduce unnecessary regulations so that parents can choose the best care for their children.\"\n\nIvanka Trump, in a speech, highlighted the impact of lack of childcare and paid leave, stating, \"Lack of child care and paid leave is not a women's issue \u2014 it is a family issue.\" She continued, \"That said, they disproportionately impact women, who provide the vast majority of unpaid care to our nation's children and adult dependents.\"\n\nChildcare and family leave have been a focus for several Democratic presidential candidates, including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who has proposed legislation to increase eligibility for the childcare block-grant subsidy and provide free childcare to some student parents. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has called for universal childcare for all children under 5, and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has proposed three months of paid family leave.\n\nIn a bipartisan effort, House Democrats this week reportedly struck a deal with the White House, providing 12 weeks of paid parental leave for federal workers in exchange for establishing the president's proposed space force as a new branch of the government in the defense authorization bill. White House domestic policy adviser Joe Grogan called the possible new benefit for federal workers an \"important first step\" toward the administration's priority of providing paid family leave for all Americans.\n\nThe administration is also asking lawmakers to reauthorize and overhaul a block-grant program that provides childcare subsidies to low-income working families. Last year, lawmakers increased the amount of childcare funds distributed to states through the program by $2.4 billion to $5.6 billion overall. However, the White House argues the program could benefit more families if lawmakers removed \"overly stringent regulations\" on facilities and staff that the administration says drive up childcare costs.\n\nAs part of the White House effort, the Council of Economic Advisers completed a report detailing the impact of childcare costs on the economy. The report found that while women with young children are about twice as likely to participate in the labor force as they were 50 years ago, some 3.8 million parents with children under the age of 6 are currently outside the labor force. The report argues that expanding childcare options, particularly by removing some regulations, could meaningfully increase the number of Americans who work rather than stay home out of concern over childcare costs.",
    " Title: Marco Rubio Downplays Significance of Recent Poll Results in Republican Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) expressed skepticism about the significance of his current standing in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, following a new CNN/ORC poll that placed him in fourth place with 11 percent support.\n\nWhen asked by host George Stephanopoulos if his \"breakout moment\" had arrived, Rubio responded, \"No, these polls do not really mean anything at this stage.\" He went on to say, \"You're a veteran of campaigns, and I'm not sure the mid-September winners are where you want to be.\"\n\nRubio acknowledged the importance of polls in determining who qualifies for the debates, but emphasized that they would not ultimately decide the election. \"They're not going to decide this election,\" he said, reiterating a stance he has maintained throughout the campaign.\n\nAs Pope Francis prepares to visit Washington this week, Rubio, a Catholic who also attends an evangelical church, addressed the pope's doctrinal authority while emphasizing his political independence. \"For me, the pope is the successor of [St.] Peter. He's the spiritual head of the church, who has authority to speak on matters, doctrinal matters and theological matters,\" Rubio said. \"I follow him 100 percent on those issues.\"\n\nHowever, Rubio added that the pope, as an individual, has political opinions that are separate from the church's doctrinal teachings. \"The pope, as an important figure in the world, also has political opinions,\" Rubio said. \"And those, of course, we are free to disagree with.\"\n\nRubio also expressed support for the pope meeting with dissidents during his nine-day visit to Cuba and the United States. On the issue of the pope's political stance on economic and geopolitical matters, Rubio said, \"The pope is just trying to bring people together. That's his role as a spiritual leader. And I respect that very much.\"\n\nRubio also took the opportunity to clarify President Barack Obama's religious affiliation and nationality, stating that Obama is a Christian born in the United States.",
    " Title: Facebook-Organized Protests Attended by Hundreds Possibly Linked to Disinformation Network\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigations have revealed that at least three events co-organized on Facebook by a group now suspected of being part of a coordinated disinformation network were held, and attended by hundreds of people. The events, which took place in New York City and Springfield, Missouri, were all co-hosted by a group called the Resisters, and were critical of President Trump.\n\nThe events, including the \"We Stand with DREAMers! Support DACA!\" event in New York on September 9, 2018, and \"The People's Protest. Springfield against Trump\" in Missouri on August 30, 2018, were attended by hundreds of people, according to archived versions of the event pages. The New York Post reported that thousands gathered in Midtown, New York, to protest Trump's decision to unwind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, while hundreds of protesters showed up in Springfield, Missouri, to protest President Trump's trip to the town at the time.\n\nFacebook executives have stated that \"inauthentic\" groups, including the Resisters, created roughly 30 events. Facebook has highlighted fake pages set up by the groups, but has no evidence that the events actually took place. There is some evidence that the events set up by Resisters were meant to piggyback on existing, legitimate events by opponents of Trump.\n\nIndivisible St. Louis told reporters that its Springfield event was already being organized when Resisters contacted them on Facebook. They also stated that they did not encounter any representatives from Resisters at the protest. The Columbus Circle in New York protest, which was similar to the one organized by Resisters, may have been organized regardless, as protests against the DACA policy had already occurred early in September 2017.\n\nRoger Ray of the Emerging Church in Springfield stated that the protest he was involved in would have happened regardless. \"I don't doubt there were lots of fake groups that might have tried to glom on, but they didn't have any physical representation. They wouldn't have had any influence,\" he told reporters in a phone interview.\n\nFacebook executives did not blame Russia or the Russian troll group the Internet Research Agency (IRA), but said that the behavior matched past work by the IRA. The IRA during the 2016 presidential election created events that were highlighted on Facebook, including one in New York City attended by thousands. Multiple organizers told reporters that they were frustrated by the possibility that the involvement of a fake account could undermine their actual cause and stressed that they were engaged in real organizing.\n\n\"I certainly was not inspired by Russia or anything like that,\" Ray said.",
    " Title: Pennsylvania and Delaware Voters Embrace Trump as GOP's Presumptive Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nYORK, Penn. \u2014 Despite concerns from some Republican leaders in Washington, rank-and-file voters are wholeheartedly supporting the GOP's presumptive nominee, Donald Trump. Voters who backed Trump's primary opponents have expressed their readiness to back the billionaire businessman.\n\nIn the aftermath of Trump's landslide victory in the Pennsylvania primary, he appears to be winning over not only Republicans but also independents and Democrats crucial for capturing deep-blue states like Pennsylvania and Delaware, which haven't voted for a Republican president in a generation.\n\nA Pennsylvania State Police trooper, who requested anonymity due to his job, voted for Sen. Ted Cruz in the primary but is now backing Trump. He explained, \"I'm a Republican. One of our problems in this country is money management, and he certainly can assist with that problem.\"\n\nGun shop owner Joe Staudt, who also voted for Cruz, is now on the Trump Train. He expressed frustration with top Republicans for not joining the bandwagon, stating, \"It's childish or maybe even selfish. The power brokers in Washington certainly don't want to give up their gravy train\u2014that's both parties.\"\n\nMegan Sweeney, spokeswoman for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, echoed the sentiment, stating, \"We are a bottom-up organization. The voters spoke loud and clear about who they wanted as the nominee.\"\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has called for party unity behind Trump, but establishment figures like House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and several primary rivals have refused to pledge their support.\n\nTrump and Ryan are set to meet on Thursday in Washington, and the speaker has offered to give up his role presiding over the Republican National Convention this summer in Cleveland if requested by Trump.\n\nRepublican strategist and pollster Jim McLaughlin noted that Trump beat Cruz, a tea party favorite, in the Pennsylvania primary by 25 points among evangelicals and by 30 points among self-described conservatives.\n\nTrump's economic message of making America \"win\" again resonates with disaffected working-class voters in Pennsylvania, one of five Northeast states, including Delaware, that Trump swept on April 26 as he moved to secure the nomination.\n\nKatie Nimon, a 22-year-old registered Democrat who waits tables at Otto's Kitchen & Cocktails, voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary but plans to cast her ballot for Trump if he faces likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. She criticized Clinton as a \"manipulative liar.\"\n\nThe same solid support for Trump was heard in nearby Delaware, which, like Pennsylvania, hasn't voted for a Republican since George H.W. Bush won the White House in 1988. Donna Pusey, a 64-year-old barber and registered Democrat, vowed to vote for Trump in November, stating, \"There's a lot of Trump support here because a lot of people are like me\u2014sick and tired of the way things are.\"\n\nPusey sat out the Democratic primary, preferring to \"rather get run over by a semi\" than choose between Clinton and Sanders. She also criticized the treatment of Trump by GOP leaders as an \"abomination.\"\n\n\"They're afraid he's going to stop a lot of cash flow into their pockets,\" she said.",
    " Title: Bill Cosby Convicted of Sexual Assault: First Celebrity Conviction Since #MeToo Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark decision, comedian Bill Cosby was found guilty on Thursday of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004, marking the first such conviction of a celebrity since the #MeToo movement. The 80-year-old, best known for his role as the lovable father on the 1980s TV hit \"The Cosby Show,\" faces up to 10 years in prison for each of three counts of aggravated indecent assault.\n\nFollowing a three-week trial at the Montgomery County courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Cosby exploded in court when prosecutors asked the judge to take him into custody, stating, \"He doesn't have a plane, you asshole!\" After the verdict was read, Cosby looked down with a sad expression, while Lili Bernard, one of his accusers, began sobbing. Constand sat stone-faced.\n\nJudge Steven O'Neill ruled that Cosby could remain out of jail on $1 million bail pending sentencing, as long as he surrendered his passport and remained at home. Cosby then left the courthouse with his lawyers and publicist, with defense lawyer Thomas Mesereau stating, \"The fight will go on, and we will appeal the conviction.\" Sentencing is expected within 60 to 90 days, after Cosby submits to a \"sexually violent predator assessment.\"\n\nAlthough he could get up to 10 years for each count, state sentencing guidelines suggest a term of less than 10 years. The conviction marks the downfall of a man once celebrated as \"America's Dad\" but whose reputation was ruined after some 50 women accused him of similar offenses going back decades.\n\nCosby had been a transcendent figure in show business, coming up as a black comedian during the civil rights movement of the 1960s and winning over white audiences with a clean routine. He went on to several successful television series when African-Americans were largely absent from TV. In \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992, he played the wise and witty Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable, the father of an affluent black family.\n\nAll the while, his accusers say, he had been drugging and molesting women. Only one of those cases was recent enough to be eligible for prosecution, that of Constand, a former administrator for the women's basketball team at Temple University, Cosby's alma mater. She had no comment after the verdict.\n\n\"The most important person in our team was Andrea Constand,\" District Attorney Kevin Steele told reporters. \"She was the first courageous person who stood up in public and went to authorities and said, 'Bill Cosby drugged and raped me.'\"\n\nAttorney Gloria Allred, who represents 33 of the Cosby accusers, rejoiced that Cosby was found \"guilty, guilty, guilty.\"\n\n\"We are so happy that finally we can say, women are believed, and not only on #MeToo, but in a court of law,\" Allred told reporters.\n\nOther Cosby accusers celebrated the verdict with hugs, cries, and applause.\n\n\"I feel like my faith in humanity is restored,\" Bernard said.\n\nThe seven-man, five-woman jury reached a unanimous verdict after deliberating for 14 hours over two days. Less than a year ago, a different jury was deadlocked after six days of deliberations on the same charges, prompting the judge to declare a mistrial.\n\nSoon after the first trial, a series of women leveled sexual assault and harassment accusations against men in media, entertainment, and politics, giving rise to the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements that encouraged women to go public with personal stories of abuse, in some cases after years of silence.\n\nLike many of Cosby's other accusers, Constand said she was drugged and violated while unable to defend herself. Cosby has said any sexual encounters were consensual, and his lawyers portrayed the accusers as fabricating stories in search of wealth and fame.\n\n\"Mob rule is not due process,\" defense lawyer Kathleen Bliss said, referring to the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe verdict comes as the #MeToo movement continues to reshape the landscape of power dynamics in the entertainment industry and beyond, with high-profile figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump facing accusations of sexual misconduct. Trump, whose inauguration and first anniversary as president were met with nationwide women's protests, denies accusations of sexual misconduct and accuses rival Democrats and the media of a smear campaign. He faces a defamation lawsuit from Summer Zervos, a contestant on his former reality show who accuses him of sexually harassing her. Trump's lawyer has said her accusations are false and politically motivated.",
    " Title: House Democrats' Support for Impeachment Inquiry: A Closer Look at the Semantics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate among House Democrats regarding an impeachment inquiry has been a topic of interest for many political analysts. A recent surge in the number of Democrats expressing support for an inquiry has led to the impression of a significant divide within the party. However, a closer examination of the situation reveals a more nuanced picture.\n\nReporters have noted a spike in the number of House Democrats supporting an impeachment inquiry, with 116 currently in favor, just short of a majority. This increase is significant, but the full story is more complex. It appears that those who do not support an inquiry are instead advocating for continuing the current investigations. In essence, these two positions amount to the same thing, as House lawyers admitted last week.\n\nIn the past, the House Judiciary Committee required special grants of power to move toward impeachment, making an inquiry a substantial step. However, this is no longer the case under current House rules and procedures. Officially opening an impeachment inquiry is, for the most part, a formality.\n\nTherefore, all those lawmakers who say they oppose an inquiry are not preventing anything, and all those who have publicly supported an inquiry are not asking for anything that isn't already happening (aside from perhaps a symbolic vote).\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is using this illusion of a dispute to her advantage. A formal vote in the full House might not set any wheels in motion, but it would increase the pressure to make a decision on impeachment one way or the other. Pelosi is right to avoid this pressure on behalf of her caucus. It is true that there appears to be plenty to investigate, so it is both in the party's interest to keep the inquiry going and the responsible thing to do.\n\nHowever, actual articles of impeachment might not have the votes on the House floor, and a failed effort would likely be a victory for President Donald Trump. Even if Pelosi could whip enough votes to send impeachment to the Senate, it would be an extremely weak statement unless Democrats were unified. A bare majority in the House for impeachment would almost certainly produce a majority against removal in the Senate, with 53 Republicans united and the 47 Democrats quite possibly split.\n\nBy contrast, keeping the investigation going is good politics, and fighting the administration's stonewalling in court is the responsible thing to do. Maintaining the fiction that there is some significant tension over whether to move to an impeachment inquiry reduces the pressure to make a premature decision and gives House Democrats an opportunity to \"vote\" by declaring themselves for or against the inquiry itself.\n\nIn other words, the whole thing is a very useful fiction, harming no one. But there is no reason for the rest of us to go along with it.\n\nThis article is based on an opinion piece by Jonathan Bernstein, a political science professor and columnist for the Washington Post. Bernstein argues that the current debate among House Democrats over an impeachment inquiry is largely semantic, with those who do not support an inquiry advocating for continuing the current investigations. He suggests that the illusion of a dispute is useful for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as it increases pressure to make a decision on impeachment while not significantly altering the ongoing investigations. Bernstein concludes that the whole debate is a useful fiction, harming no one.",
    " Title: WannaCry Ransomware: Researchers Link Attack to North Korea's Lazarus Group\n\nThe global WannaCry ransomware attack, which affected over 150 countries, has been linked to the Lazarus Group, a hacking group known to have ties with North Korea, according to security experts. The connection was made by Google security researcher Neel Mehta, who identified similarities between WannaCry and malware used by Lazarus.\n\nThe Lazarus Group has been associated with the Sony Pictures hack of 2014 and the theft of millions of dollars from a Bangladeshi bank in 2016. After Mehta highlighted the code similarities, other researchers confirmed that WannaCry, also known as WannaCrypt, Wana Decryptor, or WCry, shared malware tools used by Lazarus.\n\nWhile the connection is the most substantial public information about the cyberattack's origin, it is not enough to assign blame, as it is common to copy code. However, similarities in malware have been traced to earlier Lazarus attacks as far back as 2013, when South Korean media companies were targeted.\n\nIf validated, this would make the latest iteration of WannaCry the first nation-state-powered ransomware, according to Dubai-based security researcher Matt Suiche. This would also mean that a foreign hostile nation would have leveraged lost offensive capabilities from the Equation Group, a hacking group believed to be associated with the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).\n\nThe identity of the attacker remains a mystery, but it is widely known that the WannaCry \"exploit\" used to take control of vulnerable Windows computers was stolen from the NSA. A rogue group published the malware online in April. After it was used, Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith called out the U.S. government for \"stockpiling\" vulnerabilities.\n\nThe WannaCry attack made headlines on Friday after it disrupted the U.K.'s health system and Spain's largest telecom. There were no signs that the attack sought to single out the U.S. or South Korea, despite its emergence at a time of high tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nSecurity firm Symantec has identified tools exclusively used by Lazarus on machines also infected with earlier versions of WannaCry, which could have been used to help spread the worm to vulnerable computers. The company adds that the shared code is based on a specific sequence of 75 ciphers, which to date have only been seen across Lazarus tools.\n\nHowever, malware researcher Paul Burbage of Flashpoint, a business risk intelligence company, has not seen a solid connection between the ransomware and North Korea. \"We compared the code samples between WannaCry and previous Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) activity, but the only similarities are public libraries,\" Burbage said. \"Perhaps Symantec has more to go on than us at this point, but we are not seeing a DPRK link with the WannaCry worm campaign at this point.\"\n\nThe WannaCry cyberattack has affected over 300,000 computers, according to White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert. He also stated that while U.S. investigators do not know who is responsible for WannaCry, there are clues to follow.",
    " Title: Uncertainty Surrounds Cruz's Endorsement as GOP Unity Takes Center Stage at Republican National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Republican National Convention in Cleveland approaches, one question remains unanswered: will Texas Senator Ted Cruz board the Trump train or remain a bitter rival? Cruz is set to deliver a prime-time address on Wednesday, with no indication yet that he plans to endorse the Republican nominee. It is believed that Cruz is positioning himself for a future presidential run, either in four or eight years.\n\nWhile party unity was on display on Tuesday, Cruz's address could have an impact. He placed second in the delegate count during the nominating process and still has loyal supporters in the convention hall, some of whom disrupted proceedings on Monday. However, on Tuesday night, after Trump and his running mate Mike Pence were formally nominated, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other party leaders tried to bring the delegates and GOP voters together.\n\nPaul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager, said their operations have been \"talking back and forth\" about Cruz's speech. Manafort said he planned to look at a draft soon and was comfortable that Cruz would talk about his vision for America. While party unity was the focus of many speeches, some speakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, focused heavily on Hillary Clinton.\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a former primary rival turned supporter, warned that the country \"may never recover\" from another Clinton presidency. Trump also addressed the convention via video message, saying, \"This is a movement... but we have to go all the way.\" While party leaders called for unity, the focus on Clinton and her controversial actions and tactics remained a recurring theme throughout the convention.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Considers Conservative and Libertarian-Minded Candidates for 5th Circuit Vacancies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which covers federal districts in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, is facing two vacancies. According to a report by Legal Times, the Trump administration is moving quickly to fill these positions and has shortlisted six candidates. The names being considered include Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett, U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor of Fort Worth, former Texas Solicitor General James Ho, Andy Oldham, a deputy general counsel to Gov. Greg Abbott, Michael Massengale, a justice on Houston's First Court of Appeals, and Brett Busby, a justice on Houston's Fourteenth Court of Appeals.\n\nTwo candidates on this list stand out.\n\nThe first is Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett, a prominent figure in conservative and libertarian legal circles who was also on Trump's list of potential U.S. Supreme Court nominees. Willett is best known for his concurring opinion in the 2015 case of Patel v. Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. In this case, the Texas Supreme Court struck down a regulation requiring eyebrow threaders to obtain an occupational license before they could lawfully thread a piece of cotton string through their eyebrows. Willett's 49-page concurrence is a call to judicial arms in defense of economic liberty.\n\nThe second name on the 5th Circuit shortlist that stands out is former Texas Solicitor General James Ho. A former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, Ho is known for a 2006 law review article defending the constitutionality of birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrant parents. This position is directly at odds with the stated views of Donald Trump, who has vowed to \"end birthright citizenship.\"\n\nAn intriguing thought experiment arises: if Trump were to challenge his theory of birthright citizenship in the 5th Circuit, he might find himself in the courtroom of Trump-appointee Judge James Ho. The outcome of such a trial would be uncertain, but it would certainly make for an interesting legal debate.",
    " Title: U.S. Stock Markets Rebound Amid Iran Tensions as Trump Announces No Casualties\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, U.S. equity markets surged on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all flirting with record highs, just hours after Iran launched a missile attack on two U.S. military bases in Iraq in response to the killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani. The unexpected resilience of the stock market, despite the escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, can be attributed to President Donald Trump's reassuring statements during an afternoon speech, where he stated that no American casualties were reported from the Iranian attack.\n\nPresident Trump, flanked by top U.S. generals and Vice President Mike Pence, declared that all U.S. soldiers were safe, and only minimal damage was sustained at the military bases. He also noted that Iran appeared to be standing down, which he described as a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world.\n\nThe less bellicose posture adopted by the president, who had previously warned that any action by Iran would be met harshly, helped to push the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite to intraday records. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was on the verge of breaking a significant level at 29,000, and its own intraday record.\n\nThe calming words from Trump and Iranian officials, as well as the market's historical tendency to shake off or discount entirely military conflicts, contributed to the rebound. LPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick stated, \"No doubt worries over Iran have investors on edge. Stocks could be volatile for a while, but the impact to stocks from geopolitical events historically has tended to be short-lived.\"\n\nIndeed, the S&P 500 has declined 5% on average in 20 major geopolitical events dating back to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, the S&P 500 recovered those losses in fewer than 50 calendar days on average. The stunning assassination of President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963, for example, led to a 2.8% decline in the S&P 500, which was recovered in a day. It took markets 307 sessions to rebound from the Pearl Harbor attacks in 1941, which resulted in a total decline of nearly 20%.\n\nCrude-oil prices, however, took a hit as they fell back from an overnight spike. West Texas Intermediate crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange for February delivery fell $3.09, or 4.9%, to settle at $59.61 a barrel, after touching an intraday peak at $65.65, its highest level since April. Oil has been the biggest beneficiary of the rising tensions in the oil-rich Middle East, and some investors point to the strong gains oil has seen in the face of rising Mideast tensions as a reason for the strong pullback.",
    " Title: Impact of the Proposed Tax Reform Bill on Individual Taxpayers: A Comprehensive Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recently proposed tax reform bill is set to bring about a significant shift in the tax landscape for individual taxpayers, with the effects varying based on income, location, and common tax deductions claimed.\n\nThe bill proposes a revised income tax bracket system. For married taxpayers filing jointly, earnings up to $90,000 will be taxed at 12%, while earnings up to $260,000 will fall in the 25% bracket, and earnings up to $1 million will be taxed at the 35% rate. For unmarried individuals and those filing separately, the bracket thresholds would be half of these amounts, except for the 35% bracket, which would be $200,000 for unmarried individuals. Those making up to $24,000 will pay no income tax.\n\nThe bill aims to boost the standard deduction for middle-class families, expanding it to $24,000 for married couples and $12,000 for individuals. The child tax credit is also set to increase to $1,600 from $1,000, with an additional $300 credit for each parent and non-child dependent. However, the child tax credit eligibility is tightened, a change that could affect about three million children in working families, including approximately 80% of those born in the United States.\n\nThe bill also introduces changes that will impact taxpayers differently. For instance, it repeals certain tax credits, such as the 15% credit for individuals aged 65 or over or retired on disability, a credit that currently allows up to $7,500 for a joint return, $5,000 for a single individual, or $3,750 for a married individual filing a joint return. The bill would entirely repeal this tax credit.\n\nOther repealed provisions include the adoption tax credit, deductions for tax preparation, and credits for alimony payments. Deductions for moving expenses will also no longer be allowed.\n\nOne of the most contentious changes is the proposed modification to the popular mortgage interest deduction. Under the Republican plan, existing homeowners can keep the deduction, but future purchases will be capped at $500,000, down from the current $1 million limit.\n\nThis article aims to provide a neutral and factual overview of the proposed tax reform bill's impact on individual taxpayers. It is essential for taxpayers to understand these changes and consult with a tax professional to determine how the bill may affect their personal tax situation.",
    " Title: FBI Decision Not to Pursue Criminal Charges Against Hillary Clinton in Email Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nFBI Director James Comey announced Tuesday that the bureau will not recommend to the Department of Justice that criminal charges be brought against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in connection with her use of a private email server for government business.\n\n\"Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,\" Comey said during a press conference.\n\nClinton's spokesman, Brian Fallon, issued a statement shortly after the announcement, saying, \"We are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the Department is appropriate.\"\n\n\"As the Secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again,\" the statement continued. \"We are glad that this matter is now resolved.\"\n\nFollowing the announcement, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Clinton's rival, took to Twitter to express his disapproval of the FBI's decision.\n\n\"FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump later issued two separate statements on the matter, including one that read, \"Comey let Clinton off the hook... The fix was final. The Obama administration's anointed successor has had an indictment removed from her path and will now be able to glide to the rigged Democrat nomination.\"\n\nDespite not recommending charges, Comey delivered a scathing rebuke of Clinton's actions, stating that the FBI found that 110 emails were sent or received on Clinton's server containing classified information. He added that it was possible that people hostile to the U.S. had gained access to her personal email account.\n\n\"Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\" Comey said.\n\nComey also revealed that seven email chains were classified at the \"Top Secret/Special Access Program level\" when they were sent and received on Clinton's server.\n\n\"There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,\" Comey said.\n\nThe FBI's decision removes what was arguably the biggest threat to Clinton's presidential campaign going forward \u2013 a criminal referral that could have led to an indictment \u2013 just weeks before her party's national convention in Philadelphia, where she is set to seal her nomination as the Democrat standard-bearer.\n\nClinton consistently downplayed the FBI investigation, even calling it a \"security review,\" and as recently as June 3 said there was \"absolutely no possibility\" she'd be indicted. Weeks ago, a scathing State Department inspector general report directly countered her long-running claim that her personal email use was allowed, though her campaign continued to defend the candidate's actions.\n\nIn the wake of that report, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, stepped up his criticism of Clinton's email actions and said she belongs in \"jail.\"\n\nThe DOJ decision does not strip the email controversy as a campaign issue \u2013 Trump and the Republicans are sure to keep hammering it as the campaign lurches into full general election mode post-conventions \u2013 but shows the federal investigation did not determine the actions to be criminal, even if they were ill-advised and potentially damaging to national security.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican, said the decision not to prosecute Clinton defied explanation, adding, \"No one should be above the law.\"\n\nThe decision comes more than a year after knowledge of Clinton's use of a personal email account and server first became public. Clinton responded at the time with a point-by-point written explanation and a press conference in which she said she had opted to use her personal server for \"convenience.\"\n\nHowever, critics said she was clearly circumventing government systems in order to try to shield her communications from public records requests, potentially putting sensitive and highly classified government secrets at risk in the process.\n\nDuring a subsequent review, more than 2,000 emails on the server were found to have contained information now deemed classified, though they apparently were not marked classified when sent.",
    " Title: Tennessee Governor Grants Clemency to Cyntoia Brown, Convicted Murderer Who Was Sentenced as a Juvenile\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic decision, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam has granted clemency to Cyntoia Brown, a woman who was sentenced to life in prison for a murder committed when she was 16 years old. Brown, now 30, is set to be released on parole supervision on August 7, 2019, after serving almost 15 years behind bars.\n\nBrown was tried as an adult and convicted in 2006 for the murder of a Nashville estate agent, Johnny Allen, following a sexual encounter that turned violent. Prosecutors argued that the crime was a robbery, while Brown maintained that she was a child sex-trafficking victim who acted in self-defense.\n\nThe case gained significant public attention, with celebrities such as singer Rihanna, reality TV personality Kim Kardashian West, comedian Amy Schumer, and NBA star LeBron James voicing their support. Brown's incarceration was the subject of the 2011 documentary \"Me Facing Life: Cyntoia's Story.\"\n\nAccording to the documentary, Brown was picked up in Nashville by Allen, who agreed to pay her $150 for sex and drove her to his home. However, she claimed that once at Allen's home, he groped her roughly and reached for a gun, prompting her to shoot him in self-defense. Prosecutors alleged that she killed the victim while he was sleeping and stole his money, guns, and truck before fleeing the scene. They claimed that she was motivated by greed, but her defense lawyers argued that she was afraid of returning home empty-handed to her violent pimp, who went by the nickname Kutthroat.\n\nAfter entering a plea of self-defense, a jury found her guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, first-degree felony murder, and aggravated robbery.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the state's Republican governor said he had ordered that Brown be released to parole supervision on August 7, 2019. \"Cyntoia Brown committed, by her own admission, a horrific crime at the age of 16,\" the statement said. \"Yet, imposing a life sentence on a juvenile that would require her to serve at least 51 years before even being eligible for parole consideration is too harsh, especially in light of the extraordinary steps Ms. Brown has taken to rebuild her life.\"\n\nNashville Mayor David Briley called the decision a \"great day for social justice and our city.\" Brown, who has earned an associate degree while in prison, said she would do everything to justify Governor Haslam's faith in her. \"I am thankful for all the support, prayers, and encouragement I have received,\" she said in a statement. \"We truly serve a God of second chances and new beginnings.\"\n\nAfter the announcement was made, Kim Kardashian West tweeted her thanks. Actresses Alyssa Milano and Sophia Bush were also among the celebrities voicing their support on Twitter. Stacey Abrams, who ran as the first black female nominee for governor in the US during the mid-term elections, said the victory belonged to Brown and the activists \"who refused to concede injustice.\"",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Calls for Adult Summer Camps to Bridge Political Divide, Outlines 2016 Campaign Themes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech to more than 3,000 camp professionals at the American Camp Association of New York and Jersey's annual Tri-State CAMP Conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the need for Americans to come together and bridge political differences. The former first lady, who is expected to launch her 2016 presidential campaign in April, steered clear of controversial issues and instead focused on the need for a pragmatic approach to a gridlocked Washington.\n\nClinton opened her remarks by advocating for adult summer camps to help close the \"serious fun deficit\" in America and bridge political differences. She joked about the idea of adult campers in the \"blue cabin\" and \"red cabin\" having to \"come together and actually listen to each other.\"\n\nThe former senator lamented the growth of political division and partisanship, pointing to changes in the media and campaign finance laws as culprits. She called out the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision and criticized the \"insatiable pressure to raise money\" as \"crazy\" and \"no way to run a country.\"\n\nClinton also spoke about her advocacy for children, her book It Takes a Village, and praised camp professionals for teaching life skills to kids. She reiterated her call for universal pre-kindergarten education, portraying it as an economic and national security issue.\n\nIn a speech light on policy, Clinton also poked fun at former Vice President Al Gore, praising American ingenuity. \"Yes, we did invent the Internet, and we did give it to the world,\" she said.\n\nClinton's team has been quietly assembling in advance of her expected April launch date, with staffers already working, formally or not. Unlike Republicans testing the waters for a 2016 bid, Clinton has no entity to raise money or pay staff. Most aides are volunteering their time until she formally declares her run.\n\nA specific launch date remains uncertain, but a formal declaration sometime in April is all but assured. Despite all the planning, Clinton's team insists she has not made a final decision on a run. The moment Clinton says she's decided, she has to comply with more stringent campaign finance and disclosure regulations, so her team wants to wait until after April 1, which marks the start of a new financial quarter and clean slate for fundraising.\n\nIn a CNN/ORC poll, little has changed for Clinton in the wake of her personal email controversy, with Clinton leading Joe Biden in a potential Democratic field, 62 to 15 percent. Clinton's campaign themes for 2016 have been a pragmatic approach to getting things done in a gridlocked Washington and the need for Americans to come together. Her foil thus far has been congressional Republicans, whom she portrays as obstructionists.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Intent to Participate in Fall Debates Despite Perceived Bias, Predicts AOC Challenge for Schumer, and Criticizes Bolton\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump has announced his intention to participate in the fall debates, despite his past criticisms of the Commission on Presidential Debates. The president also made a prediction that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York would challenge Senator Chuck Schumer in a Democratic primary, stating that she would \"kick his ass.\"\n\nLooking ahead to his speech on Tuesday night, the president hinted at the possibility of Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host who announced his advanced lung cancer on Monday, being in the audience. Trump added that he might award Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nTensions were palpable as the president expressed his displeasure about Speaker Nancy Pelosi sitting behind him and next to Vice President Mike Pence during the speech. \"There\u2019s one person behind me who\u2019s going to be friendly and one who\u2019s not going to be friendly,\" Trump said, according to those in the room.\n\nThe president spent a significant portion of his time criticizing John Bolton, whose unpublished book confirms a central allegation of the impeachment charges by reporting that the president conditioned security aid to Ukraine on its willingness to announce political investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden Jr. and other Democrats. \"He turned on me,\" Trump said of Bolton.\n\nThe Iowa debacle unfolded as Gallup reported that Trump's approval rating had climbed to 49 percent, its highest in that survey since his presidency began. Despite polls showing that most Americans want the Senate to call witnesses, the impeachment trial is set to end Wednesday with an assured acquittal. It is possible, though not certain, that one or more Democratic senators will vote with Trump.\n\nMatt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, commented on the situation, stating, \"What other people would look at as a moment of completely political meltdown for this president, it all appears to accrue to his benefit. He actually looks like the adult in the room.\"\n\nMoreover, Schlapp suggested that the delayed count in Iowa would sow discord and suspicion within Democratic ranks. \"The problem for the Democrats is it will make people think and assume the fix is in again because they don\u2019t like who is leading,\" he said.",
    " Title: Trump's Pardons Under Scrutiny: A Look at the Controversial Use of Presidential Power\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has once again brought the presidential power of pardon under scrutiny, President Donald Trump announced on Thursday the pardon of conservative commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza. This decision follows recent pardons for the late heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson and Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, a former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nD\u2019Souza, who pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign contributions, had been sentenced in September 2014. His claims of a politically-motivated prosecution by the Obama-era Department of Justice (DOJ) were dismissed by the judge at his sentencing hearing as \"all hat, no cattle.\"\n\nIn addition to D\u2019Souza and Libby, Trump also pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, in August 2017. Arpaio, known for his hardline stance on immigration, was convicted of criminal contempt of court for ignoring a judge's orders to stop detaining migrants who were not suspected of a crime.\n\nThe political nature of some of Trump\u2019s pardons has raised concerns among his critics, particularly in light of his criticisms of the DOJ, FBI, and special counsel Robert Mueller. Lisa Gilbert of Public Citizen, a not-for-profit watchdog group, expressed her worries, stating, \"Trump\u2019s feeling that people who say the right things or show some kind of loyalty or play on his team should be pardoned is completely antithetical to how our justice system works.\"\n\nComparing Trump\u2019s pardons to those of other recent presidents, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, noted that Trump\u2019s pardons appear \"more politically oriented.\" He added that Trump is focusing on people whose political actions are consistent with his own, in that they have been advancing points of view that he shares or working toward his goals.\n\nDefenders of the president argue that he is not unusual in this regard. They point to President Clinton's controversial pardon of Marc Rich, a fugitive financier whose ex-wife, Denise Rich, was a major fundraiser for the Democratic Party. Trump backers also note that, when asked about the pardon of D\u2019Souza by reporters on Thursday, the president indicated he had also been considering pardons for businesswoman Martha Stewart and Rod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois.\n\nThe other question that has dogged Trump\u2019s pardons is whether he is seeking to send a signal to erstwhile aides who are now feeling the heat from Mueller\u2019s investigation into allegations of collusion with Russia. Some in liberal circles theorize that Trump is displaying his willingness to issue pardons so that people who might otherwise feel pressure to cut a deal and cooperate with Mueller might be less inclined to do so. However, there is no hard evidence to support this theory.\n\nObservers across the political spectrum have raised the issue of whether Trump might have a bias in favor of celebrities or celebrity-backed causes over more anonymous figures. The Jack Johnson pardon was prominently backed by actor and director Sylvester Stallone. Trump told reporters on Thursday that he did not know D\u2019Souza personally but \"I read the papers, I see him on television.\"\n\nThe pardon of D\u2019Souza came the day after Trump received an Oval Office visit from Kim Kardashian. In addition to advocating for the broader cause of prison reform, Kardashian is seeking a pardon for Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman serving a life sentence for drug offenses.\n\n\"The narrative may build that he\u2019s only focused on famous people,\" said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. \"Often, famous people have the best legal defense money can buy, and others don\u2019t have that opportunity.\"\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley pushed back on suggestions that the president was mostly focused on celebrity pardons when he spoke to reporters on board Air Force One on Thursday. \"Look, there are plenty of people the president is looking at right now under the pardon process,\" Gidley said.\n\nHowever, the fact that Trump had tended to issue pardons without going through the usual process of review at the DOJ concerns some skeptics. While they acknowledge that a president has expansive power to pardon, they worry about Trump\u2019s propensity to flout norms.\n\n\"There is a process set up for pardoning people and he is ignoring it,\" Gilbert said. \"I am not saying he is running afoul of the Constitution. But this is off-the-cuff, and he is doing things that a DOJ that he is simultaneously attacking might not be that into.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the reverberations from the decision to pardon D\u2019Souza will continue to be felt. Late Thursday, the lead prosecutor in his case, Carrie H. Cohen, released a statement plainly critical of Trump's decision. The debate over the presidential power of pardon will likely continue to be a contentious issue throughout Trump's presidency.",
    " Title: Analysis: Pennsylvania Special Election Results Signal Trouble for GOP in November Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nThe results of the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, where Democrat Conor Lamb has likely won by a thin margin, have sent shockwaves through the Republican Party. With a possible recount pending, the GOP is grappling with the implications of this unexpected loss in a traditionally Republican district. Here are the top three lessons that can be drawn from Tuesday's election:\n\n1. The GOP should brace for a challenging November: The historical trend of midterm elections working against the president's party, the president's low approval rating, and the intensity gap between the two parties are all factors that should concern the GOP. In the 2018 midterms, Democrats need to net 24 seats to regain control of the House. Pennsylvania-18, a district that was considered safe for the GOP, was a close race, indicating that the opposition party has a strong chance of putting many seats in play.\n\n2. Candidates matter: The underwhelming performance of Republican candidate Rick Saccone, who was not a strong campaigner, fundraiser, or grassroots favorite, played a significant role in the loss. Democrat Conor Lamb, on the other hand, ran a strong campaign, with a robust fundraising operation and impressive retail politics skills. His moderate stance on social issues, such as his opposition to an assault weapons ban, helped him neutralize the Pelosi Factor, a key element of the GOP's strategy against him.\n\n3. More Democrats will try to neutralize the Pelosi Factor: The Lamb campaign's decision to publicly oppose Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader was successful in distancing him from the unpopular San Francisco liberal. More Democrats in purple-to-red districts will likely follow suit, as the inability to take a clean hit at Pelosi hurt Republicans in PA-18.\n\nIn conclusion, the Pennsylvania special election results suggest that the GOP should be concerned about the upcoming midterms. The Democrats' ability to run a strong candidate and neutralize the Pelosi Factor in a traditionally Republican district is a worrying sign for the GOP, especially considering the historical trend of midterm elections and the president's low approval rating. The election also underscores the importance of candidates in shaping the political landscape and the potential impact of the Pelosi Factor in certain districts.",
    " Title: House Republican Announces Imminent Release of Alleged Surveillance Abuse Memo\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a House Republican has announced that the release of a secret memo detailing alleged government surveillance abuses is imminent. Rep. Dave Joyce (R-Ohio) stated Saturday that the House Intelligence Committee plans to begin the release process soon, if not immediately.\n\nThe release process could take up to 19 congressional working days, according to Rep. Joyce. This means the earliest the document could be released is sometime in mid-March, as per the House's 2018 calendar. A meeting has reportedly taken place to discuss the memo's potential public release, according to a source confirmed to the Washington Examiner.\n\nThe memo, which broke last week, has been a top story behind the impending government shutdown. House members who have viewed the highly classified Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court document allege it provides evidence of unlawful surveillance of the Trump campaign and transition by the Obama administration, a claim that former administration officials have long denied.\n\nNumerous GOP congressmen have demanded the memo's release, with some suggesting it could lead to the end of special counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia investigation and to the dismissal of senior FBI and CIA officials. Led by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), 65 GOP lawmakers wrote to House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) on Friday demanding the memo's release.\n\nGaetz, speaking on Fox News Saturday, said the memo will \"shock the conscience of this country.\" He stated, \"There are four pages of a memorandum prepared by the intelligence committee that will shock the conscience of this country when it comes to the horrific abuses that occurred during the last administration and that I believe continue to pose a threat to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\"\n\nThe memo, containing highly classified information, must be reviewed by federal records reviewers and must receive multiple levels of approval before it can be released. On Thursday, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) explained on Fox News that the document's release would first need approval from the House Intelligence Committee and then President Donald Trump would have to give it the green light.",
    " Title: John Conyers and Nancy Pelosi's Strategy Under Scrutiny: A Call for Fair and Equal Application of Rules\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on NBC's Meet the Press, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi found herself in a precarious position when she advocated for \"due process\" for Representative John Conyers, who is facing a series of allegations of improper conduct. This stance has sparked criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, raising questions about the application of rules and the concept of fairness in politics.\n\nPelosi's defense of Conyers, as well as Senator Al Franken who has also been accused of sexual misconduct, has been seen as a partisan double standard by many. While she insists on due process for Conyers, Pelosi has labeled Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore as a \"child molester.\" This inconsistency has been a source of frustration for many, particularly among Republicans who believe that the political establishment protects its own.\n\nThe backlash against Pelosi's stance is not limited to the political sphere. Her support for Conyers and Franken, as well as her opposition to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos's reforms to Title IX regulations, has been criticized as a selective application of standards of conduct. These criticisms highlight the anger and mistrust felt by many who believe that the rules are not applied fairly and equally, but rather used strategically to delegitimize and destroy political enemies while exempting the powerful.\n\nIn this context, it is worth considering the philosophical concept of the \"original position\" proposed by philosopher John Rawls. This thought experiment imagines individuals in a state of limbo, hidden behind a \"veil of ignorance,\" unaware of their future identity. The goal is to imagine what fair and just rules for society would look like if one did not know their own identity, such as gender, race, or socio-economic status.\n\nThe original position is a useful tool for thinking about fairness and equality in society. In a time marked by tribalism and identity politics, it serves as a reminder that neutral rules should be applied fairly and equally to all, regardless of tribal identity. The current political climate, marked by partisanship and selective application of rules, underscores the need for a return to this fundamental principle of classical liberalism.\n\nIn conclusion, the cases of John Conyers and Nancy Pelosi highlight the need for a more nuanced and fair approach to allegations of misconduct. The application of rules should be based on the principles of fairness and equality, as envisioned by the original position, rather than on tribal identity or partisan interests. This is not a call for leniency, but rather a call for a more thoughtful and consistent approach to the application of rules in politics.",
    " Title: Obama Urges House Republicans to End Government Shutdown, Warns of Potential Economic Consequences\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing federal government shutdown, President Obama on Saturday called on House Republicans to immediately pass a \"clean\" spending bill to reopen the government. In his weekly radio and internet address, the President read two letters from Americans affected by the shutdown, highlighting the real-world consequences of the impasse in Washington.\n\nThe President recounted the story of an Alabama woman whose Head Start agency was forced to close its doors on Tuesday, and a North Dakota family in danger of losing their federal home loan due to the government shutdown. These anecdotes are part of the President's strategy to pressure Congress to take action.\n\n\"There's only one way out of this reckless and damaging shutdown: pass a budget that funds our government, with no partisan strings attached,\" Obama said. \"There are enough Republican and Democratic votes in the House of Representatives... to end this shutdown immediately. But the far right of the Republican party won't let Speaker John Boehner give that bill a yes-or-no vote.\"\n\nThe White House has been increasingly trying to drive a wedge between House Republicans, pitting moderate members against their tea party counterparts. The administration maintains that a \"clean\" spending bill, one that doesn't include measures to repeal, delay, or defund Obamacare, could pass the House with bipartisan support.\n\nHowever, Speaker Boehner has yet to allow such a bill to come up for a vote. As the speaker and his Democratic counterparts search for a way out of the crisis - the first federal government shutdown in 17 years - Obama continues to ramp up his rhetoric.\n\n\"The American people don't get to demand ransom in exchange for doing their job. Neither does Congress,\" Obama said. \"They don't get to hold our democracy or our economy hostage over a settled law. They don't get to kick a child out of Head Start if I don't agree to take her parents' health insurance away. That's not how our democracy is supposed to work.\"\n\nWith the shutdown ongoing, Obama also looks several weeks down the road, to when the U.S. is expected to hit its \"debt ceiling.\" Analysts say the nation will reach its debt limit sometime in late October or early November, and the administration is warning that the economic damage from a default will be much worse than the current shutdown.\n\n\"For as reckless as a government shutdown is, an economic shutdown that comes with default would be dramatically worse,\" Obama said.",
    " Title: Diverse Interpretations of Martin Luther King Jr.'s Legacy on the 50th Anniversary of His March on Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic march on Washington, various groups across the political spectrum are seizing the opportunity to advocate for their respective causes, despite the tenuous connection to King's original mission of fighting racial injustice.\n\nFrom gun control activists protesting Florida's'stand your ground' laws, to advocates for D.C. statehood, the Republican National Committee, and even Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, everyone seems to want a piece of the King action. The anniversary events, which began on Saturday with a march retracing the 1963 route and continue Wednesday with speeches at the Lincoln Memorial, have sparked a range of activities, from political discussions to entertainment auditions.\n\nMartin Luther King III, the civil rights leader's oldest living child, is not concerned that the events dilute his father's core message. Instead, he aims to \"arouse a new coalition of conscience\" that can counter the energy of the tea party movement. King III attributes the recent Supreme Court ruling dismantling a key part of the Voting Rights Act, the Trayvon Martin shooting, and rising income inequality as reasons for communities of color to continue protesting and lobbying Congress for action.\n\nHowever, the run-up to the anniversary has exposed disagreement over what continuing the movement means. Alveda King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece, worries that tying specific social causes to her uncle diminishes his overarching significance. She emphasizes that her uncle was \"an imperfect human who served a perfect God\" and wants the celebrations to focus on a unifying message of love.\n\nOne of the most contentious debates revolves around whether King would have embraced gay marriage as the next frontier for civil rights. The gay community has closely aligned itself with the tributes, with multiple events honoring the late Bayard Rustin, who helped organize the 1963 march and was openly gay. A coalition of over 40 groups signed an open letter calling for \"clear federal laws barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama endorsed gay marriage last year, and the NAACP followed suit shortly after. However, many African-Americans still oppose gay marriage. Grammy-winning gospel singer Donnie McClurkin was uninvited from a concert at the King Memorial after a few activists complained about his past comments regarding homosexuality. McClurkin described the situation as \"bullying...discrimination...intolerance,\" and a civil rights infringement.\n\nDespite the disagreements, the anniversary events serve as a reminder of the enduring impact of Martin Luther King Jr.'s message and the ongoing struggle for civil rights and social justice in America.",
    " Title: Analysis: Bernie Sanders' Millionaire Status and the Fox News Town Hall\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent Fox News town hall, Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, addressed concerns about his millionaire status and the potency of his political ideas. The event was hailed as a success by his supporters, who argue that Sanders' wealth does not diminish the validity of his policy proposals.\n\nSanders' argument against the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a small elite is rooted in the disproportionate political power wielded by the super-rich. He contends that the wealthy class, through funding campaigns and lobbying politicians, exerts undue influence on the political landscape. Sanders' campaign, which is funded by small donors, seems to contradict this critique, as he has not amassed his wealth through such means.\n\nThe issue of wealth and politics is further complicated by the question of how politicians and ex-politicians capitalize on their fame. Speaking engagements at big Wall Street banks, for example, are often criticized for potential corruption, as bankers may be paying for access to future political leaders rather than for the content of the speeches.\n\nSome argue that Sanders' wealth does not make him a hypocrite, as he may genuinely hold socialist views that reject the notion of charity. However, others question why someone with millions of dollars would not use their wealth to improve the lives of many, rather than hoard it.\n\nThe Fox News town hall was praised for Sanders' ability to rally a majority of Americans, offering a clear contrast to President Trump's right-wing populism. The event served as a reminder of Sanders' ability to unite those struggling for a better life across the country.\n\nMeanwhile, the impeachment inquiry into President Trump has taken a new turn, with the release of a summary of a call between Trump and Ukraine's president. The call is said to reveal Trump's pursuit of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, potential quid pro quo arrangements, and the use of the U.S. government in his personal political schemes.\n\nTrump's defenders argue that the evidence is circumstantial, but experts contend that such evidence is not weak. They point out that circumstantial evidence can be strong, as it is based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed. The focus of the impeachment investigation will now shift to the context and circumstances surrounding the call, with enough evidence present to support impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe outcome of the impeachment process remains uncertain, but the events surrounding both Sanders' wealth and the Trump-Ukraine call have sparked significant debate and political intrigue.",
    " Title: East Coast Storm Disrupts Political Campaigns as Hurricane Sandy Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Hurricane Sandy, a potentially devastating storm, approaches the East Coast, political campaigns are canceling events and making contingency plans to ensure voting machines remain operational. The unpredictable nature of the storm has left even seasoned politicos uncertain about its impact on the final week of the campaign.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in a show of leadership, has canceled his campaign trips to Florida and Colorado to monitor the situation from the White House. Former Republican presidential candidate and ex-House Speaker Newt Gingrich found this interesting, commenting that the president canceled his trips over the hurricane but not over the Benghazi issue.\n\nBoth the president and Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney have canceled appearances in the weather-threatened swing state of Virginia to avoid consuming resources and interfering with storm preparations. Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell is making plans to prioritize power restoration for polling stations, moving them up to the same level as hospitals and police stations.\n\nIn states where polls are already open, such as Maryland, early voting has been canceled for Monday. The uncertainty surrounding the election stumps has master politicos concerned, with David Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, stating, \"Obviously we want unfettered access to the polls because we believe that the more people come out, the better we'll do, and so to the extent that it makes it harder, you know, that's a source of concern.\"\n\nThe Romney-Ryan ticket, not in power, can do little but pay attention. Romney expressed his concern for those in the path of the storm, stating, \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the people who will find themselves in harm's way.\" The Romney campaign has stopped fundraising e-mails in affected states, made a campaign bus available for relief efforts, started taking up collections in campaign offices, and set up a blog with weather-related advice.\n\nThe Romney campaign's optics are tricky, with a top Republican noting that the schedule may change depending on the storm's path. Mixing politics and weather is to double-down on the unknown, a situation that could make campaigning anywhere difficult.",
    " Title: \"Barnum's Animals Crackers Unveil New Packaging, Reflecting a Shift in Cultural Perception Towards Animal Welfare\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move reflecting the evolving societal attitudes towards animal welfare, the iconic Barnum's Animals crackers have undergone a redesign, with the animals now depicted in a natural habitat rather than confined within a circus boxcar.\n\nFor over a century, the animal cracker packaging has portrayed the mighty beasts in cages, a depiction that Mondelez International, Nabisco's parent company, felt was due for an update. Kimberly Fontes, a spokeswoman for Mondelez, stated, \"To continue to make the brand relevant for years to come, we felt this was the right time for the next evolution in our design, now showing the animals in a natural habitat.\"\n\nThe new design features the animals standing shoulder to shoulder, proudly walking in the wild. The packaging proclaims, \"NEW LOOK, Same Great Taste!\" The redesign follows pressure from animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), who have long opposed the use of animals in circuses.\n\nLast year, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced its closure after nearly 150 years due to pressure from animal rights groups and declining ticket sales. In 2015, the circus made the decision to stop using elephants in its shows, one of the reasons the company believed attendance was dropping.\n\nPETA has hailed the new box design as a symbol of a cultural shift. \"Big victories can come in small packages,\" PETA said in a statement, \"and no matter where we look, we find new evidence that people are embracing compassion for animals like never before.\" PETA participated in discussions with the company about the redesign.\n\n\"The new box for Barnum's Animals perfectly reflects that our society no longer tolerates caging and chaining exotic animals for circus shows,\" PETA added. \"No living being exists simply to be a spectacle or to perform tricks for human entertainment, yet all circuses and traveling shows that use animals treat them as mere props, denying them everything that's natural and important to them.\"\n\nMondelez has previously used its classic design to raise awareness about animal and environmental issues, as evidenced by limited-time special editions. The company notes that it continues to evolve its design to drive awareness and promote positive change.",
    " Title: House Rules Committee Finds Speaker Pelosi's Remarks Violate House Rules, but Remarks Remain in Official Record\n\nThe House of Representatives ruled Tuesday that Speaker Nancy Pelosi's criticism of President Trump violated the chamber's rules, but members voted to keep her words in the official record. The House also allowed Pelosi to continue debating on the House floor.\n\nMajority Leader Steny H. Hoyer took over the gavel to announce Pelosi's violation of the rules. \"The words used by the gentlewoman from California contained an accusation of racist behavior on the part of the president,\" Mr. Hoyer said. \"The words should not be used in debate.\"\n\nPelosi, the top-ranking House Democrat, had previously called President Trump's comments about four freshman congresswomen \u2013 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2013 \"divisive and dangerous\" to the country.\n\n\"Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president's racist tweets,\" she said. \"To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.\"\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy argued that Pelosi could have just taken back her words and apologized. \"What we just saw was a very sad day in this House \u2013 probably a historic day \u2013 so the very person who is supposed to uphold the rules broke the rules of the House,\" the California Republican told reporters.\n\nFollowing the vote, Pelosi told reporters that she stood by her statement. \"I'm proud of the attention that is being called to it because what the president said was completely inappropriate against our colleagues, but not just against them, but against so many people in our country to say, 'Go back where you came from,'\" the California Democrat said.\n\nThe rules, which trace back to Thomas Jefferson's writings, allow members to criticize the government or the president on the House floor in an official capacity, but they are prohibited from using language that is \"personally offensive\" to the president. On the matter of racial rhetoric, Jefferson's Manual explicitly states that any reference to \"racial or other discrimination on the Part of the President\" is not allowed.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, Pelosi could be punished by being barred from speaking on the floor for the rest of the day. Several other warnings about this rule, which also extends to other members of Congress, had to be issued throughout the debate.\n\nHowever, earlier Tuesday, Mr. Hoyer argued that the resolution itself wouldn't cross any lines because the criticism was aimed at tweets, not the president. \"We're condemning the language that was used, not the president himself,\" he said.\n\nRep. Emanuel Cleaver, who was serving as chairman, stepped down out of frustration. \"Unfairness is not enough because we want to just fight,\" the Missouri Democrat said before dropping the gavel. Mr. Cleaver continued to express his frustration with reporters after the vote, saying he was trying to be fair and not escalate complaints from either side of the aisle.",
    " Title: Sen. Rand Paul to Attend White House Meeting on Promise Zones Initiative, Despite Political Differences with President Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a known critic of President Obama, is among a bipartisan group of senators expected to attend the president's announcement on Thursday regarding the designation of \"Promise Zones\" to aid communities in addressing poverty. Paul is also expected to join Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other lawmakers in a private meeting with the president at the White House prior to the announcement, an aide for Paul confirmed to Fox News.\n\nThough Paul's presence may seem unexpected, the conservative senator recently introduced separate legislation to establish \"economic freedom zones\" in struggling cities like Detroit, where taxes and bureaucratic hurdles would be reduced to foster growth. In response to the announcement, Paul told Fox News, \"They say the sincerest form of flattery is imitation,\" confirming his attendance at the White House on Thursday. However, he questioned why the president's plan does not include Detroit, as his does.\n\nPresident Obama's announcement is part of a focus on income inequality in the lead-up to his State of the Union address. Promise Zones are areas where the federal government offers tax incentives and grants. Obama first announced the initiative during last year's State of the Union speech.\n\nThe White House will announce an eight-county region of southeastern Kentucky, among five locations, as \"Promise Zones\" this week. The proposed zones also include San Antonio, Texas; Philadelphia; Los Angeles; and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.\n\nThe invitation to Paul could signal another Obama \"charm offensive\" to engage with Republicans, as he did early in 2013 in an attempt -- unsuccessfully -- to achieve a \"grand bargain\" budget deal. Paul, who has recently filed a class-action lawsuit against the administration over the National Security Agency's spying practices and has pressed Obama on various issues, including a filibuster over his drone policy, may prove an elusive legislative partner.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement Wednesday that he was pleased the Obama administration decided to include Eastern Kentucky in its promise zone designation. \"I wrote a letter last year supporting this designation because this region has suffered enormous economic hardship over the last several years,\" McConnell said. \"Thousands of jobs have been lost, and economic opportunity is extremely limited, particularly because of this administration's hostile policies toward the coal industry.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Tacit Support of White Supremacy: A Closer Look at the President's Record Amid Rising Far-Right Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the horrific Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, where a gunman killed 50 Muslims, a reporter at the White House asked President Donald Trump if he believed that white nationalism was a growing threat around the world. Trump responded, \"I don't, really. I think it's a small group of people.\"\n\nThis response came on the same day that White House adviser Kellyanne Conway dismissed the alleged shooter's murderous racism, instead labeling him an \"eco-terrorist.\" Two days later, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, appeared on Fox News Sunday, where he was asked if the president had considered giving a major speech condemning anti-Muslim, white supremacist bigotry. Mulvaney responded, \"The president is not a white supremacist.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's record speaks louder than any of their words. While the president may try to evade the issue, the fact remains that a dangerous and global white supremacy is on the march, and Trump himself is at least partly to blame.\n\nOne example of this can be seen in the January 2017 mosque shooting in Quebec City, where a man stormed a mosque and shot six people dead while they prayed. The man was an ardent Trump supporter, and the New Zealand shooter scrawled the Quebec City shooter's name on one of his ammunition cartridges. The New Zealand shooter also directly applauded Trump in his own manifesto.\n\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), far-right attacks in Europe have jumped 43% between 2016 and 2017. On the domestic front, the rise is even more disturbing. According to CSIS, the number of terrorist attacks by far-right perpetrators in the United States more than quadrupled between 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe intimate connections between the president and white nationalists are well known. In 2017, the president refused to condemn the white nationalists who marched through the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, screaming such disgusting nonsense as \"Jews will not replace us.\" Heather Heyer, a counter-protester, was also killed during the rally. Days later, the president defended the marchers and claimed that there were \"some very fine people on both sides\" of that rally.\n\nThe president's words and actions have emboldened a dangerous and racist fringe, leading to a rise in hate crimes across the country. Nationwide, hate crimes rose by 17% in 2017, according to FBI statistics, the third year in a row to see an uptick.\n\nThe president's words and actions set the national tone for what is permissible speech and impermissible speech in the political arena. Trump, on the other hand, merely revels in the impermissible. Before the dead Muslim worshipers in Christchurch had even been collected and buried, the president was tweeting that Fox News should reinstate Jeanine Pirro, who had been suspended from the network for her despicable anti-Muslim comments directed at Representative Ilhan Omar.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's record speaks for itself. While he may not be criminally responsible for the acts of white supremacists, he is politically responsible, and understanding that distinction will be the first step to rejuvenating our politics.",
    " Title: Four Killed, Including Shooter, in Gilroy Garlic Festival Shooting; 12 Injured\n\nA tragic shooting incident occurred at the annual Gilroy Garlic Festival in Christmas Hill Park, Gilroy, California, on Sunday, resulting in four fatalities and at least 12 injuries.\n\nThe Gilroy Police Department confirmed that one suspect, identified as Santino William Legan, 19, was shot and killed by police at the scene. Reports suggest that there may have been a second suspect, though the search for this individual is ongoing, and it remains unclear if they were involved in the shooting.\n\nThe gunman used an assault-style rifle and began firing around 5:41 pm local time. Witnesses described the shooter as wearing Army fatigues and indiscriminately firing rounds. The police engaged the shooter within one minute, as stated by Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee, and the suspect was shot dead.\n\nSecurity at the event was tight, with bag searches and metal detector wands in place. However, investigators believe the shooter entered the festival by cutting through a perimeter fence. Festivalgoers fled in panic, and shots rang out. Videos of the chaotic scene were posted to Twitter.\n\nOne of the victims was a 6-year-old boy named Stephen Romero. Two other victims were a 13-year-old girl and a man in his 20s. Their names have not yet been released.\n\nA witness who had a brief interaction with the shooter reported that they asked him, \"Why are you doing this?\" The Associated Press reports that the shooter replied by saying, \"Because I'm really angry.\"\n\nHeavy tracked down an Instagram page that is believed to belong to the shooter. One post from the Instagram page, posted just before the shooting, reportedly promotes racist and misogynistic principles.\n\nThe Gilroy Garlic Festival is an annual event that attracts thousands of people and is known for its garlic-themed food, music, and activities. The city of Gilroy, located about 33 miles south of San Jose, issued a statement expressing their condolences and gratitude to the first responders. The investigation into the shooting is ongoing.",
    " Title: Trump's Decision to Withdraw U.S. Troops from Syria Leaves Turkey in a Delicate Position\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria has left Turkey scrambling to respond to the changing battlefield on its southern border. The unexpected move, made during a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan two weeks ago, has reshaped U.S. policy in the Middle East, abandoning a quarter of Syrian territory and handing Ankara the job of finishing off Islamic State in Syria.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, Trump was initially expected to deliver a standard warning to Erdogan over his plan to launch a cross-border attack targeting U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeast Syria. Instead, in the course of the conversation, Trump reshaped U.S. policy, abandoning a quarter of Syrian territory and handing Ankara the job of finishing off Islamic State in Syria.\n\n\"Trump asked, 'If we withdraw our soldiers, can you clean up ISIS?'\" a Turkish official told Reuters. Erdogan replied that Turkish forces were up to the task. \"Then you do it,\" Trump told him abruptly. To his national security adviser John Bolton, also on the call, Trump said, \"Start work for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.\"\n\nThe decision was a shock in Washington, where senior administration officials, including Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, tried for days to change the president's mind. When Trump made clear he would not back down, Mattis and a senior official coordinating the fight against Islamic State, Brett McGurk, both resigned.\n\nOn a visit to a U.S. airbase in Iraq this week, Trump said that military commanders had repeatedly requested extensions for the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria - requests that he finally turned down because he said Islamic State was largely beaten.\n\nAnkara has complained bitterly for years that the United States, a NATO ally, had chosen the Kurdish YPG militia as its main partner on the ground in Syria against Islamic State. Turkey says the YPG is a terrorist group, inseparable from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey in which 40,000 people have been killed.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal potentially frees Turkey's military to push the YPG back from 500 km of border without risking a confrontation with American forces. It also removes a main cause of this year's diplomatic crisis between the two countries. However, it also opens up an area of Syria far larger than anything Turkey had expected to fill, potentially pitting it against not just Kurdish forces but also the Damascus government - which is committed to regaining control of all of Syria - and its Russian and Iranian backers.\n\nThe YPG on Friday asked the Syrian government to take over the town of Manbij, which the Kurdish militia currently controls with U.S. support, to protect it from Turkish attack. If Turkish forces are to take on Islamic State in its last pocket of Syrian territory near the Iraqi border, they would first have to cross 250 km of territory controlled by the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\n\"Erdogan got more than he bargained for,\" said Soner Cagaptay, Director of the Turkish Program at the Washington Institute. \"He had asked the U.S. to drop the YPG, but not withdraw from Syria.\"\n\nAs it takes stock of the new challenge, Turkey is launching intensive talks with Washington and Moscow. Ankara expects U.S. military officials to visit within days, as well as Bolton and possibly the U.S. special Syria envoy, James Jeffrey. Turkey's intelligence chief and defense and foreign ministers are also due in Moscow on Saturday, the spokesman for Erdogan's AK Party said.\n\n\"Of course, it will be difficult. The whole issue needs to be planned again from the start,\" a Turkish security official said.\n\nA U.S. official said military planners were drafting plans that could see a withdrawal over the course of several months. One of the proposals under consideration is a 120-day withdrawal period, according to a person familiar with discussions.\n\nWashington is also grappling with what to do with weapons it provided to the YPG militia and promised to take back after the campaign against Islamic State ended. Turkey says the weapons must be collected so they are not used against Turkish troops, but U.S. officials say they cannot disarm their own allies when the fight is not yet over.\n\nErdogan announced last week that Turkey is postponing its planned military operation against the YPG in light of Trump's decision. The Turkish military has already carried out two incursions into northern Syria, backed by pro-Turkey Syrian rebels. In 2016, they targeted Islamic State and Kurdish fighters, and earlier this year took control of the YPG-held Afrin region. However, Ankara and its Syrian rebel allies alone do not have the capacity to take over the whole region which the United States is abandoning. Turkey's priority, therefore, may be to secure its southern frontier.\n\n\"Distancing the YPG from the border and wiping out these elements is of critical importance,\" the security official said. He stressed the need for careful coordination over who should fill other areas which departing U.S. forces will leave, and warned of problems ahead if agreement could not be reached.\n\n\"Is it a big victory for Turkey?\" another official said. \"I'm not sure right now.\"",
    " Title: Congressional Shooting: House Majority Whip Steve Scalise Remains in Critical Condition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) remains in critical condition following a shooting incident at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, on Wednesday morning. The shooting, which also left four others injured, took place during a practice session for an annual charity baseball game between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe attack occurred near Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, with the game scheduled for Thursday evening. Scalise, the third-highest-ranking House Republican, was admitted to MedStar Washington Hospital Center in critical condition on Wednesday, with doctors stating he arrived \"at imminent risk of death.\" He underwent surgery on Wednesday, with further surgeries required in the future.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, Scalise remains in intensive care, with his condition described as \"critical\" by Dr. Jack Sava of MedStar. Sava stated that Scalise will \"hopefully\" be able to walk and run again at some point in the future, but there is no set timetable for his recovery.\n\nThe shooter has been identified as James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old man from Illinois, according to police officials. The FBI is actively investigating Hodgkinson, including his associates, whereabouts, social media impressions, and potential motivations. The ATF is also conducting a trace on two weapons, including a 9 mm handgun and a 7.62 caliber rifle.\n\nThe incident unfolded at approximately 7:09 a.m. on June 14, with the Alexandria Police Department responding to the scene. Multiple members of Congress were present during the practice, resulting in the presence of United States Capitol Police officers. The shooter was engaged by law enforcement and shot at approximately 7:14 a.m., with five individuals transported to local hospitals with gunshot wounds.\n\nIn addition to Scalise, the victims include a United States Capitol Police officer, a congressman, a congressional staffer, a lobbyist, and the shooter. A second congressman sustained minor injuries and was also transported by a medic unit. One additional United States Capitol Police officer was transported to the hospital in a police cruiser for minor injuries and has since been released.\n\nRep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) used his belt as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding from an unidentified victim, while Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), a doctor, also tended to Scalise. Zachary Barth, a staffer for Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX), posted on Facebook that he was among those shot but is \"at the hospital and okay.\" Matt Mika, a lobbyist who is the director of government relations for Tyson Foods, was also shot in the attack.\n\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) identified Special Agent David Bailey and Special Agent Crystal Griner, both of Capitol Police, as other victims of the attack. Special Agent Crystal Griner is also at MedStar Washington and is in good condition as of Friday afternoon, according to the hospital.\n\nTwo Alexandria police officers and two Capitol Police officers exchanged gunfire with the shooter, according to law enforcement officials. The FBI is leading the investigation, with Special Agent Tim Slater, the special agent in charge of the bureau's Washington field office, stating that it is too early to determine the shooter's motive. Eyewitnesses, including Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Jeff Flake, described the officers as members of the Capitol Police force, which is responsible for protecting Capitol Hill and individual members of the House and Senate leadership.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Controversial Arizona Immigration Law's \"Reasonable Suspicion\" Provision\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Supreme Court's ruling on Arizona's controversial immigration law on Monday upheld the provision that was the subject of much criticism from President Obama, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., and other top officials over potential racial profiling. The provision, which allows police to check the immigration status of individuals they have \"reasonable suspicion\" are in the country illegally, was upheld unanimously by the court.\n\nThe law, signed by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer in 2010, had four main components. Three sections that set up state criminal penalties for immigration violations were struck down in the 5-3 ruling. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from the case.\n\nHowever, all eight justices upheld the provision allowing police to check the status of those they had \"reasonable suspicion\" were in the country illegally, and then report their identity to federal authorities. The federal government could then decide whether it wanted to pick up and deport the illegal immigrants, or let them go.\n\nWhen Arizona was debating the law, President Obama, Attorney General Holder, and other top officials expressed concerns that the provision would lead to racial profiling. In 2010, President Obama said, \"Now suddenly if you don't have your papers and you take your kid out for ice cream and you're going to be harassed\u2014that's not the right way to go.\"\n\nHowever, when the Justice Department filed its lawsuit challenging the law, it left out the racial profiling argument, instead focusing on issues of federal versus state power over immigration. Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli told the court during oral arguments in April, \"We're not making any allegation about racial or ethnic profiling in the case.\"\n\nRepresentative Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who has emerged as a top voice for legalizing illegal immigrants, expressed concerns about the potential for racial profiling. \"Experience has shown us that police are highly unlikely to stop an individual with the last name of Kennedy or Roberts on suspicion of not being a legal U.S. citizen, but if you are a Gutierrez or Martinez, watch out,\" he said.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority that there is \"basic uncertainty about what the law means and how it will be enforced.\" He added that it would be \"inappropriate to assume\" that the provision will be construed in a way that creates a conflict with federal law.\n\nThe court left open the chance for further challenges if the law becomes discriminatory. In particular, the justices seemed concerned that immigration checks could unconstitutionally prolong the amount of time an officer detained someone during the status checks.\n\nArizona Governor Jan Brewer said in a statement Monday that police need to be aware that opponents are watching them. \"Our critics are already preparing new litigation tactics in response to their loss at the Supreme Court, and undoubtedly will allege inequities in the implementation of the law,\" she said. \"As I said two years ago on the day I signed SB 1070 into law, 'We can not give them that chance. We must use this new tool wisely, and fight for our safety with the honor Arizona deserves.'\"",
    " Title: Reflecting on the Iraq War: A Decade of Lessons Learned\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Iraq War, a decade has passed since the United States' military withdrawal in 2011, and the consequences of the conflict continue to reverberate across the Middle East. The war, which was initiated to destroy weapons of mass destruction and later to nation-build, has left a lasting impact on American society and the region as a whole.\n\nThe Iraq War, one of the longest in American history, has resulted in thousands of American deaths, tens of thousands of casualties, and trillions of dollars in expenditure. Yet, the benefits of this costly endeavor remain elusive. The primary reason for this, according to many analysts, is the failure to recognize the unique cultural and political dynamics of the Middle East.\n\nThe West tends to view peace as the default state, with war being a temporary aberration. In contrast, the Middle East perceives war as the norm, with peace being a temporary interlude between conflicts. This fundamental difference in perspectives has been a significant factor in the failure of the Iraq War.\n\nThe Iraq War began under the administration of President George W. Bush, who was later criticized for the questionable grounds on which the war was initiated. The war was initially won, but was later lost, only to be won again with the surge. The war's end, marked by President Obama's decision to withdraw troops in 2011, has proven to be anything but final.\n\nThe city of Fallujah, a leading city in Iraq's Anbar province, serves as a stark reminder of the war's futility. A battleground in 2004, Fallujah is once again a battleground, with a reconstituted Al Qaeda seizing control. The predominantly Shiite Iraqi government has vowed to retake the city, but the prospect of another civil war between Shiite and Sunni Arabs looms large.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that the military personnel who served in Iraq performed heroically throughout the conflict. They fought valiantly, innovated, and rose to the challenge of nation-building tasks they were not trained for. The blame for the Iraq War, however, lies not with the military, but with the political leaders of both parties and both presidencies.\n\nThe Iraq War was marked by tragic missteps, from the flawed intelligence that led to the invasion to the failure to anticipate the insurgency and the premature withdrawal of troops. The war's aftermath has left Iraq on the brink of another civil war, a stark reminder of the region's millennia-old conflicts.\n\nAs the United States recovers from the Iraq War, it is essential to learn from the past and approach future conflicts with a more sober, shrewd, and strategic mindset. The hope is that the lessons of the Iraq War will lead to a more peaceful and prosperous future, not just for the United States, but for the world.",
    " Title: Business Groups Lobby for TPP Approval Amidst Political Divide\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the political fervor surrounding the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, business groups have launched a nationwide lobbying effort to secure its approval. This push comes as both major political parties have expressed opposition to the agreement during their respective conventions.\n\nCaterpillar Inc., a leading manufacturer, has hosted lawmakers such as Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen of Minnesota at its factories. These meetings aim to highlight the benefits of the TPP for the company's workers.\n\nTrade Benefits America, a prominent business coalition, is coordinating a grassroots advertising campaign, sending approximately 60 to 70 pro-TPP letters to members of Congress daily. The Association of Equipment Manufacturers is also actively promoting the agreement, touring the Midwest with an interactive truck display and running digital ads in key Senate races.\n\nKevin Madden, a strategist working with the Trade Benefits America coalition, emphasized the impact of these personal stories on lawmakers. \"When you see trade, when it's just a sign being waved on a convention floor... that's one thing,\" Madden said. \"But when it's somebody who has a small- or medium-size enterprise in your local economy, who is directly responsible for the employment of people whose jobs are tied to exporting... that has an impact on lawmakers, and that's important.\"\n\nDespite the opposition from both major-party presidential candidates and a majority of Democratic leadership, proponents of the TPP remain optimistic. They point to polls showing a majority of Americans support free trade and argue that the negative rhetoric at the party conventions has amplified a minority of anti-TPP voices that do not fully understand the agreement's facts.\n\nSupporters believe that lawmakers will ultimately vote in the interests of their districts rather than following the positions of the presidential candidates. The current political climate has increased the urgency to pass the TPP before either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump becomes president and potentially scraps or freezes the agreement.\n\nEd Gerwin, a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democrat think tank that supports TPP, stated, \"Donald Trump apparently doesn't want to trade with anyone; he wants to withdraw from the WTO and basically turn us into North Korea. And if Secretary Clinton says that she is not a supporter of TPP, that puts even more pressure on supporters of TPP to try to get it done now.\"\n\nThe administration will need to address concerns from lawmakers, particularly regarding protections for biologic drug firms and tobacco companies. However, a compromise on financial services companies was reached the week before the Republican convention, which could serve as a model for resolving the remaining issues.\n\nBill Miller, a senior vice president in charge of lobbying operations at the Business Roundtable, stated, \"It's not going to be easy, but it's certainly doable.\" Linda Dempsey, vice president of international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers, echoed this sentiment, saying, \"It's not going to be easy, but it's certainly doable.\"\n\nLobbying groups are employing various strategies to connect with lawmakers, including op-eds, town halls, and flooding congressional offices with handwritten letters from company employees. John Michael Gonzalez, a Democratic lobbyist and strategist who works on trade, expressed optimism, stating, \"From my experience, it always looks so bleak. But it always prevails. At the end of the day, our government and our elected officials move forward, not backwards.\"\n\nSome groups are also taking advantage of the summer recess to show lawmakers the importance of trade deals on their home turf. For example, the agriculture community is using summer fairs to highlight the benefits of trade deals. In mid-September, executives from footwear companies will visit Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers and emphasize the TPP's impact on the cost of shoes.\n\nMatt Priest, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America trade association, said, \"This is an all-hands-on-deck moment. We can not leave any stone unturned, any email not sent or call not made.\" The intensity of the lobbying effort reflects the urgency felt by proponents of the TPP to secure its approval before the presidential election.",
    " Title: Court of Military Commission Review Overturns Conviction of Guant\u00e1namo Detainee, Raising Questions on Terrorism Trials\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant ruling, the Court of Military Commission Review has overturned the conviction of a Guant\u00e1namo detainee, Ahmed al-Darbi, who was accused of being a member of Al-Qaeda but not of plotting a specific terrorist attack. The decision, penned by Judge Brett Kavanaugh, has been hailed as a major blow to the legitimacy of the Guant\u00e1namo military commissions, which have been conducting trials for alleged war crimes since their inception.\n\nAl-Darbi, a Yemeni national, traveled from Yemen to Pakistan and Afghanistan in 1996. He attended a Qaeda training camp, met Osama Bin Laden, and became a driver for jihadis and their weapons. He later drove Bin Laden personally and was told by Bin Laden several days before Sept. 11, 2001, that they would have to evacuate their compound due to an impending operation that might provoke retaliation.\n\nAl-Darbi was captured in Afghanistan in 2001 and was sent to Guant\u00e1namo Bay soon after it opened in early 2002. His legal journey was slow, partly due to legal challenges to the Bush administration's new system of military commissions for terrorism suspects. He was charged with conspiracy as well as eight counts of material support in 2008. He was acquitted of the conspiracy charge, which could have resulted in a longer sentence. He was sentenced to 66 months of confinement and credited for the time he had already served since being charged.\n\nThe verdict was a setback for military prosecutors, who had argued that they could detain him indefinitely. However, even after his release, he continued to challenge his conviction. The Court of Military Commission Review upheld his conviction in 2011, but the Appeals Court has now reversed this decision.\n\nThe ruling calls into question whether other Guant\u00e1namo detainees accused of being part of Al-Qaeda but not of plotting any specific terrorist attack can receive military trials. Zachary Katznelson, senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, stated, \"This decision strikes the biggest blow yet against the legitimacy of the Guant\u00e1namo military commissions, which have for years now been trying people for a supposed war crime that in fact is not a war crime at all.\" He suggested that the government should prosecute in civilian courts any Guant\u00e1namo prisoners against whom it has enough admissible evidence.\n\nThe opinion was largely joined by Chief Judge David Sentelle and Judge Douglas Ginsburg, appointees of Ronald Reagan. The decision is expected to have far-reaching implications for the future of military commissions at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.",

Kennedy's assassination, cities across the nation are hosting events to honor the late president. In Dallas, where the tragic event took place, a public observance is scheduled for Friday, Dealey Plaza, the site of the assassination.\n\nThe commemoration will feature Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David McCullough, who will read excerpts from Kennedy's presidential speeches. The U.S. Naval Academy Men's Glee Club will perform, and religious leaders will offer prayers and a benediction. Approximately 5,000 tickets have been issued for this event.\n\nIn a unique tribute, the Texas Theatre in Dallas will screen War is Hell, the film that was playing when Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's assassin, entered the theater. The film will be shown at 1:20 p.m. on Friday, with approximately 40 minutes of the original footage being shown due to the loss of the full copy. Admission is 90 cents, the price of a ticket in 1963.\n\nA day of service, #JFKDay, is being held in Dallas on November 23 to honor Kennedy's memory and service legacy.\n\nIn Washington D.C., the Newseum will host \"JFK Remembrance Day\" on Friday, featuring a rebroadcast of three hours of CBS News' live television coverage of the assassination. President Obama will deliver a speech at the Smithsonian American History Museum on Wednesday evening on Kennedy's legacy of service. On Friday, he will meet privately with leaders and volunteers from the Peace Corps, an organization Kennedy established in 1961.\n\nThe Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, where Kennedy's funeral was held, will host a Choral Mass of Remembrance on Friday.\n\nIn Arlington, Virginia, the eternal flame at Kennedy's grave site at Arlington Cemetery was restored last month and is open to the public over the anniversary weekend. President Obama, accompanied by First Lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, will visit the grave on Wednesday.\n\nIn Brookline, Massachusetts, the John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site, the neighborhood and house where the president spent his childhood, will offer free admission to the public on Saturday and Sunday. A brief memorial ceremony will be held at the president's birthplace at 2 p.m. on Sunday, including a reading of President Lyndon Johnson's 1963 National Day of Mourning Proclamation and a wreath-laying.\n\nJohn F.

    " Title: Federal School Safety Commission Recommends Rescinding Discipline Guidance, Emphasizes Mental Health Services and Armed Personnel\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, the Federal Commission on School Safety has released a report detailing recommendations to enhance school safety. The report, which focuses on various aspects of school safety, including mental health care and infrastructure security, suggests rescinding existing discipline guidance that aimed to protect minority students from disproportionate disciplinary actions.\n\nThe 200-page report, compiled by the commission formed after the Parkland high school massacre, avoids discussing gun laws and does not recommend arming teachers. Instead, it offers guidelines for schools to consider arming \"highly trained school personnel\" in rural areas where law enforcement response times may be extended.\n\nThe commission's report emphasizes that there is no single policy that will ensure school safety, with Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos stating, \"What will work for schools in Montana will be different than what will work for schools in Manhattan.\"\n\nThe report recommends reviewing school infrastructure, including windows, hallways, and doors, and in some instances, having someone on school grounds armed with a firearm to collaborate with law enforcement. The report also encourages more coordination between schools and local law enforcement, suggesting that some communities may benefit from hiring military veterans or retired law enforcement officers into school roles.\n\nThe report includes recommendations aimed at the media, urging news outlets to exercise responsibility in covering school shootings and refrain from publishing pictures of the perpetrator. The commission also emphasizes the importance of mental health services for students, social and emotional learning, and the adoption of \"extreme risk protection orders\" that would temporarily withhold guns from those who pose a risk to themselves or others.\n\nPresident Trump hosted the commissioners and individuals affected by school shootings at the White House, with Trump calling the report \"a very important thing.\" The report has received mixed reactions from families affected by school shootings, with some praising its comprehensive approach to school safety, while others criticize the report for not addressing the role of guns in school shootings.\n\nAndy Pollack, whose daughter Meadow died in Parkland, called the report \"the most comprehensive report by any administration on a school shooting.\" Lori Alhadeff, the mother of 14-year-old Parkland victim Alyssa, expressed her support for the commission's findings. Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime Guttenberg, 14, was killed in Parkland, criticized the report for not considering the role of guns in school shootings.\n\nMark Barden, whose son Daniel was one of the 20 first-graders killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, issued a statement praising the report's emphasis on mental health resources but expressed concern over the commission's continued support for arming school personnel. Barden stated, \"We believe that teachers and school administrators should be focused on education, not weapons training.\"\n\nThe report's recommendations will now be considered by the administration and Congress as they work towards improving school safety in the United States.",
    " Title: ObamaCare Exchanges: Analysts Warn of Limited Doctor Access, Potential Rationing\n\n Article:\n\n As the enrollment period for private health care coverage under ObamaCare begins, analysts are warning that the plans may provide insurance but limited access to doctors and hospitals. The concern is that the system could resemble Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans, due to the potential for lower payments leading to doctors refusing to see patients.\n\n Merrill Matthews, director of the Council for Affordable Health Insurance, stated, \"Indeed, I think this will eventually be like Medicaid.\" He explained that insurers will control costs by \"clamping down on the amount they are willing to pay.\"\n\n James Capretta, of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, noted that about half of physicians in many communities already refuse to take Medicaid patients due to low payments. Doug Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, suggested that some plans on the exchanges are heading in the same direction.\n\n By the end of March, the Obama administration hopes to increase the number of people on Medicaid by 9 million and the number in private plans by 7 million. However, the rapid expansion of Medicaid and the potential for lower payments for private insurance raises the prospect of rationing, as too many people chase too few doctors.\n\n Robert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, stated, \"These networks are going to be jammed with people. Far more than they're treating now, and I do not doubt that we're going to have problems with access to these doctors. There just aren't going to be enough of them.\"\n\n The Obama administration is currently trying to move past a year of ups and downs for its health care law and encourage people to sign up during the final three months of open enrollment. President Obama stated in his year-end press conference that enrollment has picked up considerably as problems with the federal exchange website have been addressed. He emphasized that the law is providing health insurance to those previously unable to get it.",
    " Title: Biden's Focus Shifts to Trump as Sanders Chapter Closes in Democratic Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in strategy, former Vice President Joe Biden, during a rally in Henderson, Nevada on February 14, 2020, emphasized the need to replace President Donald Trump, rather than focusing on his rival, Senator Bernie Sanders. This strategic move comes after Biden's decisive victory in the recent debate, which, despite his win, was not a scintillating event, according to political analysts.\n\nThe debate, which was initially scheduled for another round in April, might not take place due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The conventional wisdom from the previous ten debates was that Biden benefited from the time constraints on a crowded stage, as it limited opportunities for gaffes and Bidenisms. However, in a one-on-one matchup, Sanders' disciplined, surgical strikes came across as repetitive and canned, while Biden appeared more composed.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, who had previously been perceived as a formidable contender, is now, according to Biden, a single-issue candidate. Sanders' focus on healthcare and economic inequality, while effective in the past, seems disconnected from the current crisis and ill-suited to deal with it, as evidenced by his responses during the debate.\n\nSanders' repeated attacks on the \"health-care industry\" during the debate, particularly during a public health emergency, were criticized as tone-deaf, given that this industry is on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis. Similarly, his repeated focus on income inequality during the economic consequences of the pandemic was seen as ideological ax-grinding, rather than providing immediate and practical solutions.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, has shifted his focus to the imperative of replacing Trump, a unifying message for all of his potential voters. The general election, in Biden's view, has begun, and the last thing the Democratic Party needs is more debates about its direction. The Sanders chapter, according to Biden, is over, and it's time to unite behind a candidate who can defeat Trump in November.\n\nThis strategic shift by Biden indicates a recognition that the primary race is nearing its end and the focus should now be on the upcoming general election. By emphasizing the need to replace Trump, Biden is positioning himself as a unifying figure who can appeal to a broad spectrum of voters, rather than getting bogged down in internal party debates.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Increased Tariffs on Turkish Steel and Aluminum Amidst Ongoing Diplomatic Dispute\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a move that escalates the ongoing diplomatic dispute between the United States and Turkey, President Donald Trump announced on Friday that he would increase tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Turkey. The decision comes as the Turkish Lira, the country's currency, continues to depreciate against the U.S. dollar.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump wrote, \"I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar! Aluminum will now be 20 % and Steel 50 %. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!\"\n\nThe tweeted tariff threat follows the Trump administration's imposition of sanctions on Turkish officials over the imprisonment of American pastor Andrew Brunson, which the administration has deemed \"unjust\" and \"unacceptable.\" The sanctions targeted Turkey's Minister of Justice, Abdulhamit Gul, and Minister of Interior, Suleyman Soylu.\n\nBulent Aliriza, an expert on Turkey with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, stated that Trump's latest decision to increase tariffs will push Turkey's economy \"into more difficult waters.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said that Trump \"has authorized the preparation of documents\" to raise steel and aluminum tariffs on Turkey, citing a section of the U.S. trade law that allows penalties \"on imports from particular countries whose exports threaten to impair national security.\"\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan responded defiantly to Trump's announcement on Friday. \"We will not lose the economic war,\" Erdogan said during a tour of Black Sea provinces, according to the Hurriyet Daily News, an English language outlet. \"This is a national struggle.\"\n\nRuhsar Pekcan, Turkey's trade minister, said Trump's decision would harm U.S. companies and consumers. \"Turkey is deeply disappointed by the U.S. Administration\u2019s decision to double steel and aluminum tariffs. The tariffs were groundless when they were announced in June, and remain so now,\" Pekcan said.\n\nAliriza stated that Trump's move will strengthen Erdogan in the short run, because it allows him to fan existing anti-American sentiment in Turkey. \"It's difficult to be optimistic\" about reaching a resolution to the standoff and lowering tensions between the two countries, he said.\n\nThe proposed tariff hikes come just days after Turkey\u2019s deputy foreign minister was in Washington to meet with U.S. officials on a range of contentious issues, including Brunson's detention. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert declined to detail those conversations during a briefing with reporters on Thursday.\n\n\"Obviously you all know that we have a very broad relationship with Turkey and a host of issues that we talk about with the Turkish government whenever we do meet,\" Nauert said Thursday. \"Yesterday we had a wide-ranging conversation with Turkish government officials. We made it clear that Pastor Brunson needs to be returned home.\"\n\nShe declined to say whether the two sides made any progress on the release of Brunson. \"We would define progress as Pastor Brunson being brought home,\" she said.\n\nMore: Trump administration sanctions Turkish officials over American pastor's arrest\nPreviously, Trump has used tariffs against countries he claims are engaging in unfair trade practices against the United States. The action against Turkey appears to flow from political differences between the two countries, particularly the Brunson case.\n\nTurkey accuses Brunson, arrested in 2016, of being a spy and says he was involved in an attempted coup. The United States says he has been falsely charged. Trump has discussed the Brunson case with Erdogan but has been unable to obtain the pastor's release.\n\nErdogan said last week that U.S. sanctions will not affect the Brunson case. \"We will not give any credit to this type of threatening language,\" Erdogan told reporters Wednesday in Ankara. \"It is not possible for us to accept that America gets up, especially with an evangelist, Zionist mentality, and uses this kind of threat-filled language.\"",
    " Title: Ellen DeGeneres and George W. Bush Share Friendship Amidst Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and former President George W. Bush were spotted together at a Dallas Cowboys football game on Sunday. The duo, along with their respective partners, were seen enjoying the game in a series of pictures and video clips.\n\nThe sighting sparked controversy, as some took to social media to express their disapproval. Tweets ranged from accusations of rehabilitating a \"war criminal\" to criticisms of the pair's political differences.\n\nHasan Abi (@hasanthehun) tweeted, \"Ellen DeGeneres is rehabilitating a war criminal and any liberal who buys into the lie that GWB is a sweet old man is a trog.\"\n\nOliver Willis (@owillis) wrote, \"George W. Bush literally ran for reelection on a constitutional amendment so @TheEllenShow would be barred from being able to marry. I know they're both rich, but that's not a mere 'difference of opinion.' That's an attempt to make one person less of a person than the other.\"\n\nRafael (@rafaelshimunov) tweeted, \"This is what Bush brought Iraqi families, daily, for his oil friends. @TheEllenShow and @gwenstefani are patting themselves on the back for rainbow capitalism, comparing a war criminal to 'disagreements' while actively sanitizing them in service of endless greed and selfishness.\"\n\nIn response to the backlash, DeGeneres addressed the controversy during her show on Tuesday. She highlighted a supportive tweet that read, \"Seeing Ellen and George Bush together makes me have faith in America again.\"\n\nDeGeneres defended their friendship, stating, \"I'm friends with George Bush. In fact, I'm friends with a lot of people who don't share the same beliefs I have. We're all different, and I think that's okay that we're all different.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Just because I don't agree with someone on everything doesn't mean I'm not going to be friends with them. When I say, 'Be kind to one another,' I don't mean only the people that think the same way that you do.\"\n\nThe controversy highlights the ongoing cultural dialogue's emphasis on canceling individuals who have done or said something wrong. The debate raises questions about the importance of maintaining friendships and civility, even in the face of political differences. As Senior Editor Brian Doherty has argued, ending relationships over politics is rarely a good idea. Gratuitous cruelty toward those who are part of the \"other side,\" tribe, or team does not make the world a better place.",
    " Title: Declassified Documents Detail U.S. Surveillance Programs and Minimization Procedures\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Security Agency (NSA) has declassified a series of documents that offer insights into previously secret programs that collect vast amounts of metadata on domestic phone calls and electronic communications of foreigners, as well as some Americans. The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, stated that the release was \"in the public interest.\"\n\nThe most significant document is a 17-page ruling by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) that outlines the minimization procedures, or safeguards, the government must follow when dealing with the collected data. The New York Times reports that the releases also include two formerly classified briefing papers to Congress from 2009 and 2011, when the provision of the Patriot Act that the court relied on to issue the order was up for reauthorization.\n\nThese briefing papers portray the bulk collection of metadata as an \"early warning system\" that allows the government to quickly identify connections to terrorism suspects. The 2011 briefing paper states, \"Both of these programs operate on a very large scale, but only a tiny fraction of such records are ever viewed by N.S.A. intelligence analysts.\"\n\nThe documents released contain numerous redactions, and at first glance, they do not seem to reveal much more detail than what was already known from the leaked documents provided to The Guardian and The Washington Post by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nOne of the mysteries that remains is the legal rationale for allowing the bulk collection of the electronic data of Americans. The government's authorization for the collection of phone metadata is based on section 215 of the USA Patriot Act. The briefing document, however, points out that no \"content\" is being collected. Instead, the program is only collecting information that the Supreme Court has decided is \"not protected by the Fourth Amendment.\"\n\nThe government's interpretation of the law is a subject of debate among legal scholars and civil libertarians, who are waiting for the Judicial Branch's interpretation. The FISC order also includes an exception for technical personnel, who are allowed to query the data without adhering to the safeguards, but any information queried is not allowed to be used for \"intelligence analysis purposes.\"\n\nThe Washington Post frames the release of the FISC order as an attempt by the government to calm privacy concerns. The documents will continue to be analyzed, and noteworthy findings will be reported as they emerge.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Accuses Donald Trump of Catering to Racist and Conspiratorial Elements in Campaign Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech delivered today in Reno, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton accused her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump, of embracing and amplifying extremist and conspiratorial viewpoints. Clinton's speech, titled \"Donald Trump and his advisors' embrace of the disturbing 'alt-right' political philosophy,\" was an extended critique of Trump's character, his policies, and his alleged associations with hate groups and controversial figures.\n\nWhile the alt-right, an umbrella term for a collection of racist micro-movements and online subcultures, was a significant focus of the speech, it was not the primary antagonist. The primary target of Clinton's criticism was Donald Trump himself. The alt-right, Breitbart, Alex Jones, David Duke, Nigel Farage, and Vladimir Putin were all mentioned in the speech, but in a supporting role.\n\nSome of Clinton's arguments were met with criticism for their lack of clarity. For instance, she began her litany by quoting Trump's recent comments about the struggles faced by the African-American community. While many might view these comments as an attempt to demonstrate empathy, Clinton characterized them as a \"dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.\" She also overstated the alt-right's influence, claiming that the \"de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump campaign\" had resulted in the alt-right \"effectively taking over the Republican Party.\"\n\nHowever, Clinton's speech was not without merit. She highlighted Trump's history of retweeting white nationalists and his false claim that he witnessed thousands of New Jersey Muslims celebrating the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThroughout the speech, a consistent theme emerged: Donald Trump is a bigot and a conspiracy theorist. While this idea has been prevalent since Trump entered the presidential race, Clinton's speech represented a forceful and concentrated expression of this notion. The speech is likely to energize her supporters and may help mobilize voters.\n\nThe speech's impact on the alt-right, however, remains to be seen. The minute-long section of the speech dedicated to the alt-right may receive significant media coverage in the coming days, potentially leading some curious conservatives to research the term \"alt-right.\"\n\nMeanwhile, one individual who is likely to be pleased with the speech is Alex Jones. Clinton's direct criticism of him is sure to be a topic of discussion among Jones' listeners for some time.",
    " Title: GOP and Fox News Pursue Course Correction in Wake of 2012 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 election, the Republican Party and Fox News are taking decisive steps to tone down the partisan rhetoric that has characterized both in recent years. The aim is to appeal to a broader electorate and regain credibility.\n\nFox News, the leading cable news network in the U.S., has parted ways with two of its most divisive personalities, Sarah Palin and Dick Morris. The network, which has seen a dip in ratings since the election, is reportedly seeking to distance itself from the controversial figures who stoked the Republican base but alienated many voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Karl Rove, a key figure in the Republican Party who was sidelined by Fox after the election, has helped establish the Conservative Victory Fund, a super PAC designed to prevent controversial conservatives from winning Senate primaries.\n\nSenate Republican leaders have also implemented a strategy to collaborate with popular tea party members, Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, to manage anti-establishment conservatives within their own ranks.\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has been vocal in his criticism of the Republican Party, urging it to avoid nominating extreme candidates. He stated, \"The fact that we lost a winnable election has caused Republicans to take this very, very seriously. I don't think it's just a marketing change. I don't think it's just cosmetic changes. It is going to require some serious changes, not in principles, but in the way we talk and act.\"\n\nA high-profile Republican strategist, who wished to remain anonymous to avoid antagonizing the segments of the party they are trying to silence, confirmed a deliberate effort by party leaders to \"marginalize the cranks, haters, and bigots\u2014there's a lot of underbrush that has to be cleaned out.\"\n\nFor the Republican Party, this shift is a matter of survival, following two consecutive elections in which extremely conservative candidates lost winnable Senate races. For Fox News, it's about credibility: the network, while still the top-ranked in news, has seen its ratings decline since the election, in part, due to conservative viewers feeling misled by the coverage.\n\nRoger Ailes, Fox's chairman and CEO, has a keen understanding of his audience\u2014Fox viewers. He revolutionized television by tapping into Republican disdain and anger towards the mainstream media. This strategy has been successful, creating not only the most-watched cable news channel in the country but also political celebrities, several of whom dominated Republican politics in the 2012 cycle. However, the network faced criticism for its coverage during the 2012 election, particularly on election night when Rove, a Fox contributor, argued against the consensus that President Barack Obama would win Ohio.\n\nIn the wake of the 2012 election, both the Republican Party and Fox News are working to redefine their images and regain the trust of the American electorate.",
    " Title: Egypt Launches Airstrikes Against ISIS in Libya in Response to Slaughter of Egyptian Christians\n\nArticle:\n\nEgypt's military carried out a series of airstrikes against ISIS militants in Libya on Monday, in retaliation for the brutal slaughter of 21 Egyptian Christians by the jihadist group. The bombing raids, which targeted 10 sites in the ISIS stronghold of Derna, have drawn Egypt deeper into the international fight against ISIS and highlighted the extremist group's growing presence in North Africa.\n\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told CNN that the airstrikes were aimed at degrading ISIS' capabilities within the city of Derna. However, an umbrella group of Islamist militias in Derna issued a statement claiming that the city's residents, including women and children, were the targets of the bombings.\n\nThe airstrikes came after ISIS released a gruesome video on Sunday that appeared to show militants beheading at least a dozen Egyptian Christians on a Libyan beach. The video, produced by ISIS' propaganda wing al-Hayat Media, has intensified international concerns about ISIS' deepening reach into countries far beyond its strongholds in Syria and Iraq.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi had warned on Sunday that his country \"reserves the right of retaliation and with the methods and timing it sees fit for retribution for those murderers and criminals who are without the slightest humanity.\" He also declared a week of mourning in the Muslim majority nation for the slain Christians.\n\nIn a statement, Egypt's Foreign Ministry called for other nations battling ISIS to support Egypt's efforts and to target terrorists in Libya as well. The U.S. government condemned the killings, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry calling Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Sunday to offer condolences.\n\nEgypt is already fighting against ISIS-allied militants on its own territory in the Sinai Peninsula, where dozens of people were killed in a series of attacks in January. Concern has increased over ISIS' rising influence in Libya amid the power and security vacuum prevalent in the country since the 2011 uprising that overthrew former dictator Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nCNN reported in November that fighters loyal to ISIS had complete control of the city of Derna, which has a population of about 100,000 and is situated not far from the Egyptian border. Jihadists with allegiance to ISIS had also expanded their presence westward along the Libyan coast, forming chapters in cities including Benghazi, Sirte, and even Tripoli, the capital, according to Noman Benotman, a former Libyan jihadist now involved in counterterrorism for the Quilliam Foundation.\n\nThe links between the different branches of ISIS present a real challenge for Western leaders, as U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress to formally authorize the use of military force in the war against ISIS. \"While we can come up with a military solution or a military operation in a restricted area like Syria and Iraq, what do we do when it expands to North Africa?\" Lt.

He will also hold his first meeting as president with the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.\n\nThe outreach effort comes after a tumultuous first weekend in the White House that included lambasting news organizations for correctly reporting on the size of the crowds at his inauguration and mass protests against his presidency on the following day.\n\nTrump delivered a more unifying message Sunday and sought to reassure Americans he was up to the daunting task ahead. Speaking in the White House East Room during a swearing-in ceremony for top aides, the president warned his staff of the challenges ahead but declared he believed they were ready.\n\n\"But with the faith in each other and the faith in God, we will get the job done,\" he said. \"We will prove worthy of this moment in history. And I think it may very well be a great moment in history.\"\n\nTrump said his staff was in the White House not to \"help ourselves\" but to \"devote ourselves to the national good.\"\n\n\"This is not about party, this is not about ideology. This is about country, our country. It's about serving the American people,\" he said.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Trump offered a scattershot response to the sweeping post-inauguration protests, first sarcastically denigrating the public opposition and then defending the right to demonstrate a short time later.\n\n\"Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote?\" Trump tweeted early Sunday morning. Ninety-five minutes later, he struck a more conciliatory tone.\n\n\"Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views,\" the president tweeted, still using his personal account.\n\nTrump also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accepted an invitation to visit the White House in early February. The prime minister said he is hoping to forge a \"common vision\" with the newly inaugurated U.S. president that could include expanded settlement construction and a tougher policy toward Iran.\n\nTrump also announced that he's set up meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.\n\n\"We're going to start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA,\" he said of his meeting with Pena Nieto. Mexico is part of the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada. Trump said he also will discuss immigration and security at the border. He has promised to build a wall along the length of the southern border and insisted that Mexico will pay for it.\n\nTrump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on \"Fox News Sunday\" the president would spend his first full week in office undoing some of former President Barack Obama's agenda and planned to sign executive orders on immigration and trade. Trump planned to sign some executive orders on Monday, but it was unclear which.\n\nTrump has pledged to scuttle trade deals such as a pending Asia-Pacific agreement and overturn Obama's executive order deferring deportations for 700,000 people who were brought into the country illegally as minors.\n\nLater in the week, he'll address congressional Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia and meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May.",

Longoria, who has been labeled a \"Hispanic activist and power player in Washington, D.C.\" by the Wall Street Journal, has been a strong supporter of President Obama, serving as a co-chair of his reelection campaign and delivering a speech at the Democratic National Convention last September.\n\nThis week, Longoria is making headlines as an executive producer and host of the Latino Inaugural, a concert at the Kennedy Center featuring performances by several artists including Jose Feliciano, Melanie Griffith, and New York City's Ballet Hispanico. As a co-chair of the Presidential Inauguration Committee, Longoria is actively involved in the preparations for Obama's second inauguration.\n\nFor those interested in following the inauguration events, live streaming video coverage of Inauguration 2013: Barack Obama will be available on the \u2588\u2588\u2588.com Live page starting at 9:30 a.m. EST on Monday, with additional coverage available on the \u2588\u2588\u2588 iPad App and mobile devices.\n\nLongoria emphasized the economic importance of immigration reform, stating, \"We have to understand that we are dependent upon a labor force in this country, specifically in agriculture, to provide low-cost products, and they're jobs that nobody else is doing.\" She believes that there is room for compromise on both sides of the aisle on immigration, and that the benefits of reform are significant for all parties involved.\n\nLongoria, who was one of President Obama's leading Latino fundraisers during his reelection campaign, noted the historic mobilization of the Latino vote in the recent election. She expressed optimism that the Republicans will recognize the political, moral, and economic imperatives for immigration reform.\n\nDespite her political activism, Longoria has no plans to run for office in her home state of Texas. \"I respect everything that politicians do. I think it's a very, very big job,\" she said. \"It's not my day job, so I'm just doing what I can to help the communities in which I came from.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Issues Executive Order on Gun Control: Constitutionality and Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama announced Tuesday the issuance of an executive order on gun control, focusing on background checks, licensing, and reporting requirements. The order aims to address occasional gun sales and the requirement for physicians to report conversations about guns to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAn executive order is a written instruction from the president to the executive branch of the federal government, outlining the president's desired enforcement of federal laws or regulations. Executive orders do not apply to private persons or branches of government other than the executive. Executive orders remain in effect until abandoned or rescinded by the president who issued them or a successor president.\n\nHowever, President Obama's executive order on guns faces constitutional challenges due to the extensive, detailed, and clear nature of congressional legislation on the matter. Congress has expressly removed occasional sales from the obligation of obtaining federal licenses and conducting background checks. The president's attempt to require background checks for occasional sellers may be deemed unconstitutional, as it negates the congressional will on this matter.\n\nThe president's order also requires physicians to report conversations about guns to the Department of Homeland Security, potentially infringing on the patient-physician privilege. This requirement may encourage governmental intrusion into private conversations, a fundamental liberty protected by the Constitution.\n\nThe right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental liberty under the Constitution, accorded the highest protection from governmental intrusion. The president's executive order, which expands the scope of gun control, may be seen as a step towards totalitarianism, as it potentially infringes on this fundamental right.\n\nUnder the Constitution, Congress writes the laws, the president enforces them, and the courts interpret them. President Obama's executive order, which effectively writes new laws and interprets existing ones, may be deemed unconstitutional. The courts will ultimately determine the validity of the president's executive order on guns.",

The probe, named after astrophysicist Eugene Parker, lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on August 12, 2018.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is set to become the fastest-moving manmade object in history. Its data promises to crack longstanding mysteries about the Sun's behavior. The mission is the first spacecraft to be named after a living person, with Parker, 91, having first described solar wind in 1958.\n\nThe launch took place at 03:31 local time (07:31 GMT) with the Delta-IV Heavy rocket. The launch came after a failed attempt the previous day due to a last-minute alarm that caused the agency to miss its 65-minute window. Just under an hour after the launch, Nasa confirmed that the spacecraft had successfully separated and the probe had been released into space.\n\nThe probe aims to dip directly into our star's outer atmosphere, or corona. It will zip past Venus in six weeks and make a first rendezvous with the Sun a further six weeks after that. Over the course of seven years, Parker will make 24 loops around our star to study the physics of the corona, the place where much of the important activity that affects the Earth seems to originate.\n\nThe probe will dip inside this tenuous atmosphere, sampling conditions, and getting to just 6.16 million km (3.83 million miles) from the Sun's broiling \"surface\". Dr. Nicky Fox, the UK-born project scientist who is affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, explained, \"I realize that might not sound that close, but imagine the Sun and the Earth were a meter apart. Parker Solar Probe would be just 4cm away from the Sun.\"\n\nThe probe will also be the fastest man-made object ever, traveling at speeds of up to 430,000mph [690,000km/h] - a speed that would take it from New York to Tokyo in under a minute. The mission is expected to provide valuable insights into the Sun's behavior, potentially improving our understanding of solar activity and its impact on Earth.",
    " Title: Reporters Committee Urges Washington Court to Quash Subpoena Aimed at Seattle News Outlets Over Protest Footage\n\nA legal organization, the Reporters Committee, has filed a brief with the King County Superior Court, urging it to quash a subpoena issued to five Seattle news organizations. The subpoena, served earlier this month by the Seattle Police Department, demands the outlets to hand over all raw footage and photographs taken within a several block radius during a 90-minute period on May 30, a day marked by protests against police violence and racial injustice.\n\nThe police department seeks the footage to aid in identifying suspects involved in the arson of a police car and the theft of firearms during the protest. In a friend-of-the-court brief filed on June 29, the Reporters Committee argues that the subpoena is unenforceable, as it allegedly violates the Washington shield law, the First Amendment, and creates an impression that journalists serve as an extension of law enforcement.\n\nThe brief expresses concern that enforcing the subpoena could lead to further violence against journalists, as some protesters view journalists as being allied with the police. A journalist covering a Tucson protest, despite wearing press credentials, was assaulted by protesters who believed he was working with the police.\n\nThe brief states, \"Enforcement of the Subpoena could mislead the public into perceiving reporters at protests as a mere arm of law enforcement, thus eroding public trust in the news media and increasing the already-significant risk of physical harm that journalists face when covering protests.\"\n\nThe Reporters Committee, which regularly files friend-of-the-court briefs and represents journalists and news organizations pro bono in court cases involving First Amendment freedoms, newsgathering rights of journalists, and access to public information, encourages readers to stay informed about their work by signing up for their monthly newsletter and following them on Twitter or Instagram.",
    " Title: Morgan Stanley Strategist Sees Parallels Between Current Market Recovery and 2009, Predicts Rally in Financial Sector\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the coronavirus-induced recession, the financial crisis of a decade ago serves as a significant point of reference for investors, with some arguing that the ensuing bear market took 18 months to reach its lowest point, while others believe swift government intervention has prevented a similar fate for the current market.\n\nMichael Wilson, the head of U.S. equity strategy at Morgan Stanley, is among the optimists, likening the current market recovery to March 2009, when the U.S. economy was emerging from the crisis, and the S&P 500 index was beginning its longest bull-market run in history.\n\nIn a note to clients on Monday, Wilson noted that the market's trajectory closely mirrors the Great Financial Crisis period in many ways. He observed that stocks have rebounded in a \"similar pattern\" to March 2009, with the number of individual stocks trading above their 200-day moving average beginning to climb, supported by cyclical stocks like small-capitalization stocks, which typically lead at the beginning of recoveries.\n\nAnother similarity between the two periods is the equity-risk premium, or the expected earnings yield for the S&P 500 minus the 10-year Treasury yield, which gives investors a rough estimate of the extra return they'll get investing in stocks compared with risk-free government bonds. Wilson's bullish call in March, when he predicted a stock-market bottom on March 16, was based on the equity-risk premium reaching the same levels observed in March 2009.\n\nThough traditional cyclical stocks like small-caps have outperformed of late, other sectors, such as financial stocks, have not. In fact, bank stocks are performing worse relative to the S&P 500 than during the bank-driven financial crisis. Wilson attributes this dynamic to the Federal Reserve's stimulus measures, which he believes are repressing government bond yields in a way that is scaring bank investors.\n\n\"The biggest headwind for banks is the persistently low level of rates,\" particularly for longer-term debt, Wilson wrote. Low interest rates hurt banks because they lower the profit margins they can earn by issuing loans.\n\nHowever, Wilson believes the market is underestimating the chances that longer-term bond yields, like the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, will rise significantly as the economy recovers from the coronavirus, and is therefore underestimating chances for a huge rally in financial-sector stocks. He points to Congress passing at least $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus, the potential for a faster and more sustained recovery in the post-coronavirus economy, and unexpected inflation as demand returns before supply chains can adjust as possible catalysts for higher inflation and long-term interest rates.\n\n\"While hypothetical, these are real possibilities and worth considering given current levels of inflation and 10-year Treasury yields,\" Wilson wrote. \"We continue to think higher 10-year rates would be perhaps the biggest surprise to markets at the moment and would have significant implications for equity markets and leadership.\"",
    " Title: Key Democratic Figures Remain Neutral in 2016 Presidential Primary Race\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2016 Democratic presidential primary race heats up, key party figures are remaining neutral, according to a report by The Hill. Despite Hillary Clinton's alleged backing from the Democratic establishment, she has not been able to attract the support of several prominent party figures.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, who previously named Clinton as the nation's top diplomat, has announced his intention to vote in the March 15 primary in Illinois. This decision could send a strong signal as he could potentially abstain from voting for Clinton.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, who declined to challenge Clinton for the nomination in October, has yet to announce his support for the former first lady. Instead, he criticized her for a statement made at a debate and warned against candidates attacking President Obama's record.\n\nSenate minority leader Harry Reid, who announced in June that he would soon endorse a candidate, has yet to make an official endorsement. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, who has strongly indicated her support for Clinton, has not yet formally endorsed her.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator and a prominent progressive Democrat, adamantly insisted that she was not running for the nomination despite being heavily recruited by fellow Democrats.\n\nRichard Trumka, the head of the nation's largest federation of labor unions, the AFL-CIO, has praised both Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. However, some labor leaders have criticized Clinton for her support of some of President Obama's trade legislation.\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown, who challenged Bill Clinton for the nomination in 1992, has been critical of Hillary Clinton during her email scandal, but has spoken warmly of her in recent months.\n\nClinton currently holds the most endorsements in the primary race, with 145 House members, 38 of the 46 senators who caucus with Democrats, 12 governors, and 17 national unions backing her. By comparison, Bernie Sanders has been endorsed by two members of Congress and three labor groups.\n\nAs the primary race continues, several key Democrats and groups remain on the sidelines, including President Obama, Vice President Biden, Sen. Harry Reid, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Richard Trumka, and Gov. Jerry Brown. The lack of endorsements from these influential figures could potentially impact the outcome of the primary race.",
    " Title: Trump Disputes Media Perception of Assange Allegiance, Cites Intelligence Community Support\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday, President-elect Donald Trump disputed the media's portrayal of his perceived agreement with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, stating that he merely reports what Assange states and leaves the interpretation of truth to the public.\n\nTrump's tweets read, \"The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange - wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against \u2018Intelligence\u2019 when in fact I am a big fan!\"\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has long maintained that Russia was responsible for cyberattacks targeting American political entities, with the hacked emails from prominent Democratic individuals and institutions being released by WikiLeaks and similar sites. Assange, who has been residing in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 to avoid extradition on sexual assault charges, has stated that his source for the emails was not a foreign state.\n\nTrump's citation of Assange stems primarily from his Wednesday tweet, which read, \"Julian Assange said \u2018a 14-year-old could have hacked Podesta\u2019 - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!\"\n\nTrump's stance on WikiLeaks in 2010, when the website published thousands of pages of classified information provided by Chelsea Manning, an Army private at the time, was markedly different. A tape uncovered by CNN revealed that Trump, in a conversation with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade, said, \"I think it's disgraceful, I think there should be like death penalty or something\" when asked about WikiLeaks.\n\nRather than accepting the assessment of the intelligence community, Trump has argued that identifying the true culprit behind the cyberattacks would be nearly impossible and has suggested that he possesses information regarding the cyberattacks that others do not. He and his team have argued that the assessment of the CIA and the FBI that Russia acted to aid Trump's candidacy and install him as president represents an attempt to delegitimize the incoming administration.\n\nTrump is scheduled to receive a briefing on Friday from the nation's top intelligence officials outlining the government's evidence implicating Russia in the cyberattacks. Trump had previously stated that the briefing was scheduled for earlier in the week, but a U.S. official disputed this claim, telling \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the president-elect's briefing was always scheduled for Friday.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who ran against Trump as Democrat Hillary Clinton's vice presidential pick, expressed shock at Trump's citation of Assange. While the FBI and CIA are the only two intelligence agencies whose assessments regarding Russia's motives have been made public, Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees, told CNN's \"New Day\" that it was the \"unanimous conclusion\" of the intelligence professionals who had briefed him that Russia had indeed sought to aid Trump's campaign.\n\n\"I note that he does not go to his intelligence briefings most days. I do go to my intelligence briefings, and I know what the evidence is. If he went to his intelligence briefings, maybe he'd have a different conclusion about this,\" Kaine said in his first national TV interview since the presidential election. \"There's something very unusual, indeed even sort of suspicious, about the degree to which he casually kicks aside the intelligence community when he won't even go to the briefings and again and again takes the Assange-Vladimir Putin line on this important question.\"",
    " Title: \" Obama's Approach to National Security Policies: A Shift from Bush Era, Yet a Continuation of Counterterrorism Measures\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, Michael Allen, a former Bush aide and author of \"Blinking Red,\" has raised questions about President Obama's response to reviews of his national security policies. Allen suggests that when disagreeing with such reviews, Obama should make it clear that he is largely adopting the recommendations, but not without reservations.\n\nAllen, now managing director of Beacon Global Strategies, expresses concern that Obama's response might lead to overcorrection, potentially exposing the country to more danger. He anticipates Obama might say, \"We need to make a major course correction.\"\n\nUpon taking office, President Obama inherited many of the counterterrorism measures from President Bush's second term. Bush had already moderated his counterterrorism program, ceasing waterboarding, emptying secret C.I.A. prisons, transferring many prisoners from Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and securing bipartisan legislation on detention, interrogation, and surveillance.\n\nObama made adjustments to these policies but largely kept the program intact, even expanding it in the case of drone strikes. This shift in policy was further influenced by an extremist's attempt to detonate an airliner with explosives during Obama's first presidential Christmas in Hawaii.\n\nSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican critic, has characterized Obama as more authoritarian than Bush on privacy issues. Paul, who has been alarmed by disclosures about N.S.A. programs, believes they are more alarming than he had initially anticipated.\n\nWhite House officials dispute such characterizations, but the momentum to revamp N.S.A. rules comes at a time when Obama also faces other decisions on how much to shift course. Allies are pressing him to support the release of a comprehensive Senate report on the history of interrogations and torture. The president is also left to decide how much to scale back drone strikes, as he signaled he planned to do in a speech this year.\n\nAdm. Dennis C. Blair, Obama's first director of national intelligence, urges a broader debate on national security policies, not just surveillance. Blair criticizes the administration's approach as \"small-ball play,\" suggesting that the administration is not genuinely seeking debate but rather a debate about the balance between security and privacy that the nation desires.",
    " Title: Obama's Second-Term Legacy Takes Shape as President Pursues Unilateral Action on Key Policy Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final years of his second term, President Barack Obama has intensified his efforts to advance his policy agenda without securing congressional approval, a strategy that could yield swift results but may also face potential undoing by lawmakers or a future president.\n\nThe latest example of this approach was the President's policy, announced Thursday, to shield more than four million illegal immigrants from deportation. The President has also announced an aggressive climate deal with China, presided over an Environmental Protection Agency plan to order carbon-emission cuts at power plants, and pursued nuclear negotiations with Iran.\n\nFurthermore, the White House has been exploring options to close the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay without Congress's approval.\n\nUnlike earlier this year when the President took steps, for instance, to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors, the current actions are more comprehensive in scope.\n\nWith prospects uncertain for passing major legislation in the new, Republican-controlled Congress, President Obama has begun to build a second-term legacy that is likely to be defined in large part by unilateral action.\n\nHowever, this strategy comes with risks. Republican lawmakers have threatened to undo the President's actions, and a future president may potentially reverse some of President Obama's moves on immigration and climate change.\n\nMore immediately, the President's decision to bypass lawmakers could diminish the chances of forging agreements with Republican leaders on other issues. GOP lawmakers warned that President Obama would \"poison the well\" by acting unilaterally on immigration.\n\nIn an interview that aired Sunday on ABC, President Obama said, \"What the American people expect is that if we disagree on one thing... then we work on everything else.\"\n\nSuggesting that the legislative process wasn't at an end, some Republicans said the party should respond to President Obama by taking the reins on policy and passing GOP-sponsored immigration bills, though it remained unclear what policy the party would put forward and whether President Obama would sign on.\n\n\"It's incumbent on Republicans to come up with our own agenda, a positive, constructive agenda,\" said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) on CBS on Sunday. McCaul, who leads the House Homeland Security Committee, said such an effort likely would lead with a border-security bill, but noted that Congress wouldn't take up the issue until next year.\n\nPresident Obama said in the interview that both Republican and Democratic presidents have taken similar executive actions.\n\n\"The history is that I have issued fewer executive actions than most of my predecessors, by a longshot,\" he said. \"Take a look at the track records of the modern presidency; I've actually been very restrained. And I've been very restrained with respect to immigration.\"\n\nThe first two years of President Obama's second term yielded few legislative victories and little progress on the White House's top goals, such as raising the minimum wage and enacting comprehensive immigration legislation.\n\nPresident Obama largely was sidelined during this fall's campaigns, and Republicans cast Democratic defeats in the midterm elections as a rejection of the President's policies.\n\nThe White House has resolved to push forward on President Obama's agenda during the remaining two years.\n\n\"He does feel the pressure of time,\" Dan Pfeiffer, an Obama senior adviser, said Friday at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. \"We all do.\"\n\nOn both immigration and climate change, the President tried but failed to work with Congress to pass legislation before acting on his own. In addition to striking a deal with China to cut carbon pollution, President Obama has laid out aggressive limits on power-plant emissions, another unilateral move that could stand as one of the more far-reaching actions of the second term.\n\nWilliam Galston, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said acting on immigration and climate change always have been priorities for President Obama, but they have risen in importance as legislative avenues have been closed off.\n\n\"Things that you can get done through executive decisions look much more attractive in highly polarized circumstances,\" said Mr. Galston, who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nWhite House officials also see a range of opportunities to define the President's second term in the foreign-policy realm.\n\nThe Obama administration has continued to press for an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program, despite skepticism in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have suggested that they would move to impose more sanctions on Iran if they aren't comfortable with a deal. President Obama said in the ABC interview that he remained confident that if an agreement is reached, he could convince Congress it is the right thing to do.\n\nPresident Obama also appears determined to make good on a campaign promise to close the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\u2014another potentially dramatic use of executive power. The White House has discussed ways to override a congressional ban on bringing detainees to the U.S., senior administration officials have said.\n\nWhile the President has said he wants to work with Congress, he and his advisers recently have struck a more defiant tone about President Obama's powers to act on his own. President Obama has said he has an answer for lawmakers who question his authority on immigration: \"Nobody is stopping them from passing a bill.\"\n\nJohn Podesta, counselor to the President, predicted that Republicans who want to undo the President's power-plant rules would fail, saying, \"I don't believe they can stop us from doing that.\"\n\nSuch statements have fanned discord between the White House and the GOP. But on Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) placed blame on both his party and the President, saying \"shame on us as Republicans\" for failing to pass legislation to overhaul the immigration system.\n\n\"My party has failed,\" he said on CNN. \"This president has failed miserably, and he's made it worse.\"",
    " Title: The Transformation of the Republican Party: A Look Back at the 2010 Elections and the Rise of Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the Republican Party is currently undergoing a significant transformation, a shift that can be traced back to the 2010 elections and the emergence of Donald Trump as a prominent figure in the party.\n\nConservative activist and talk-radio host Laura Ingraham recently commented, \"They have to come to terms with what they created. They'll talk about everything except the fact that their policies are unpopular.\" This statement underscores the growing disconnect between the Republican establishment and their downscale voters, a divide that was magnified by the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in the Citizens United case, which increased the influence of wealthy donors in Republican circles.\n\nIn the years leading up to Trump's presidential campaign, these voters had largely abandoned the increasingly liberal and cosmopolitan Democratic Party. They found a champion in Trump, a blue-collar billionaire who promised to expand Social Security, reject big donor money, challenge Chinese central bankers, and alleviate Americans from unfair competition from foreign workers.\n\nThe Democratic Party is also grappling with a populist insurgency this year, driven in part by economic pain and growing anger towards Washington and Wall Street. However, while Senator Bernie Sanders trails Hillary Clinton in delegates, Trump's unlikely campaign has become a seemingly unstoppable force, one that Republican lawmakers, donors, and activists are only now fully confronting.\n\nFoster Friess, a Wyoming investor and significant GOP donor, has noted the neglect of \"the people who truly make our country work\u2014the truck drivers, farmers, welders, hospitality workers.\"\n\nSix years ago, as the 2010 elections neared, everything seemed to be falling into place for the Republican Party. Republicans celebrated an impending repudiation of President Obama in congressional races, in which they would eventually pick up 63 seats. On the ninth floor of the Beresford apartment building on Central Park West, guests clinked glasses at a fund-raiser for Republican Senate candidates hosted by Paul Singer, the billionaire investor. Singer, a self-described Goldwater conservative and proponent of an immigration overhaul deal, had tripled his campaign giving, doling out almost $3 million in contributions to Republicans in 2010.\n\nToday, the Republican Party, once a stronghold of traditional conservatism, is being reshaped by the populist sentiments of its voters, a transformation that continues to unfold.",
    " Title: Special Counsel Recommends Up to Six Months' Imprisonment for George Papadopoulos for Lying to FBI in Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent court filing, special counsel Robert Mueller has recommended a sentence of up to six months in prison for George Papadopoulos, a former aide to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials during the campaign. The recommendation, which includes a strong rebuke of Papadopoulos for failing to assist with the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, was made in documents filed with the court.\n\nProsecutors did not make a specific recommendation but urged the judge to give Papadopoulos jail time and said a sentence within the guideline range of up to six months imprisonment was \"appropriate and warranted.\" The government stated that Papadopoulos should be held accountable for having repeatedly misled them about critical facts in an investigation of national importance, after having been explicitly warned that lying to the FBI was a federal offense.\n\nPapadopoulos' wife, Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos, told ABC7 Chicago I-Team on Friday evening that \"unfortunately they [prosecutors] didn't value George's cooperation.\" She said that federal authorities have ignored evidence favorable to her husband.\n\nPapadopoulos, who had served as a volunteer to the Trump team, traveled as an emissary from the campaign to foreign leaders in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. In July 2017, he was charged with lying to the FBI about his contacts during the campaign with a professor who had \"substantial connections to Russian government officials.\"\n\nCourt records filed by special counsel Robert Mueller describe how the professor approached Papadopoulos after learning of his role in the Trump campaign. The professor, who has since been widely identified as Joseph Mifsud, told Papadopoulos the Russians had \"dirt\" on Democrat Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails\" that they had procured, according to the court documents.\n\nPapadopoulos reportedly bragged about that offer to an Australian diplomat, who then tipped off the FBI and launched that agency's counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nPapadopoulos was arrested by the FBI when he arrived at Dulles International Airport in July 2017 and charged under seal. He agreed to cooperate with investigators in exchange for a lighter sentence.\n\nThe government's sentencing recommendation includes clear signs that the Mueller team felt betrayed by Papadopoulos after he struck a plea agreement and pledged his full cooperation. The filing says Papadopoulos repeatedly withheld key details about his contacts with Russians and neglected to turn over the cell phone he used to communicate with Mifsud until the government expressly asked for it.\n\n\"His lies negatively affected the FBI's Russia investigation, and prevented the FBI from effectively identifying and confronting witnesses in a timely fashion,\" the filing says. \"His lies were not momentary lapses. He lied repeatedly over the course of more than two hours, and his lies were designed to conceal facts he knew were critical: the importance of the information he received from the Professor, and his own communications and contacts with Russians and Russian intermediaries during the Trump campaign.\"\n\nThe filing also says that, even after his initial FBI interview, Papadopoulos made repeated attempts to land jobs with the fledgling Trump administration, including a high-level post with the National Security Council.\n\nPapadopoulos' legal team will file their own sentencing assessment to the court in two weeks, and is expected to ask for probation. The sentence recommendation comes as Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos has mounted the latest in a series of publicity campaigns, this one suggesting her husband has misgivings about his plea agreement.\n\nBack in December, in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, she had described her spouse as the \"John Dean\" of the Russia probe, a reference to the Watergate-era former White House counsel who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct justice and became a key witness against President Richard Nixon and his aides.\n\nEarlier this month, Papadopoulos received a sealed sentencing document prepared for the court. After that, the defendant's wife began an aggressive media blitz in which she strongly hinted her husband is considering changing lawyers and rescinding his plea deal.\n\nAfter appearing before Democratic members of the House intelligence committee earlier this summer, she said that Papadopoulos has come to believe the professor may have been working for Western intelligence agencies and set him up.\n\n\"I actually never said explicitly that it was an entrapment from the FBI. I just said that he definitely was... the target of a different set-up,\" she said.\n\nIn June, the Daily Caller News Foundation reported that Simona Papadopoulos said, \"It looks to be one among a series of attempts to entrap George,\" adding, \"The question today to me [is whether] these people are simply shady businessmen or are they part of a greater attempt to entrap George in illegal activity.\"\n\nSince her husband's guilty plea in exchange for cooperation with the Mueller probe, Papadopoulos has been living in Chicago. Federal investigators have imposed restrictions on his travel until his sentencing, which is now scheduled for September 7.",
    " Title: Garza v. Hargan: A Controversial Court Case Divides Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Abortion Rights for Illegal Immigrant Minors\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing court case, Garza v. Hargan, has become a significant point of contention for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court. The case, which revolves around an illegal immigrant teen held in government custody seeking an abortion, has drawn criticism from both pro-life and pro-choice activists for Kavanaugh's attempts to find a middle ground.\n\nThe case, known as Jane Doe, involved an unaccompanied minor who crossed the U.S. border last year and was sent to a government-funded facility. After undergoing a medical examination, she was informed that she was pregnant. She expressed her desire for an abortion, but the Trump administration delayed the request, citing its interest in protecting the fetus while the girl was in government custody.\n\nThe girl had the necessary funding for the abortion procedure and obtained a judge's consent in Texas. However, the government argued that it would still be required to transport her and provide post-procedure care, which Justice Department lawyers argued would violate federal law prohibiting taxpayer spending on elective abortions.\n\nThe government proposed that it should be given the opportunity to place the girl with a family member or willing sponsor in the U.S., arguing that they would be best equipped to help her make such a significant decision. A lower court ruled in favor of the girl and the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented her in the case.\n\nHowever, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, led by Judge Kavanaugh, sided with the government, overturning the lower court's decision. The full D.C. Circuit later overturned the three-judge panel's decision, ruling that illegal immigrants have a right to abortion and that the Trump administration's efforts to delay in order to find a sponsor were infringing on that right.\n\nJudge Kavanaugh penned a dissent, stating that the majority's decision established \"a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.\" The Supreme Court later erased the lower court's opinion, citing that the girl had rushed to get an abortion, and thus, there was no longer a live controversy.\n\nThe ruling has left activists on all sides frustrated. Sen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, expressed her opposition to Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, stating that he disregarded Supreme Court precedent and opposed the health care rights of a vulnerable young woman.\n\nFrom the right, the American Family Association and the Susan B. Anthony List have expressed concerns with Judge Kavanaugh's ruling, finding it insufficient in upholding abortion rights restrictions. They also raised questions about a 2015 opinion Kavanaugh authored in another major case, Priests for Life v. HHS, where he ruled for the priests but not broadly enough for some conservatives.\n\nHowever, the Rev. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, expressed delight at Judge Kavanaugh's selection, while the Susan B. Anthony List praised Kavanaugh for reaching the right conclusions in both Priests for Life and Garza, where they said he rejected the ACLU's assertion of a constitutional right to abortion on demand for illegal immigrants.\n\nIn conclusion, the Garza v. Hargan case has become a significant point of contention for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, with activists on both sides of the abortion debate expressing concerns about his rulings on the matter. The case has left a lasting impact on the debate surrounding abortion rights for illegal immigrant minors in government custody.",
    " Title: Modest Deficit Reduction Goals Raise Concerns for Future Fiscal Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, some on the political left are defining successful deficit reduction as stabilizing the federal debt at about 70 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2022. This goal, according to several economists and financial experts, is far too modest and could leave future fiscal policy perilously constrained.\n\nUnder current assumptions, achieving this goal would require combined reductions in spending growth and/or increases in taxes of $1.4 trillion over the 2014-2022 period. This is significantly less than the total deficit reduction provided by the 2011 Budget Control Act (BCA) and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013 (ATRA), which resolved the 2011 debt ceiling debate and avoided the fiscal cliff, respectively.\n\nRichard Kogan of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, supported by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times, argues for more modest deficit reduction. The editorial page of the Washington Post shares similar concerns, stating that the proposed goals are dangerously modest.\n\nThe potential consequences of such a low deficit reduction target become particularly evident when considering the next economic recession. With a debt-GDP ratio already above 70 percent, a recession would likely push the ratio above 100 percent, making it harder to argue for stimulus measures and potentially leading to a more severe recession.\n\nHowever, if the economy manages to maintain a steady growth path without a recession, the deficit associated with stabilizing the debt-GDP ratio at 70 percent of GDP would be more than 10 percent higher than that consistent with a 60 percent ratio \u2013 the limit chosen by the drafters of the Maastricht treaty that created the Euro. This significant increase in the rate at which the nation's wealth is being depleted could have long-term negative effects on the standard of living for future generations.\n\nKogan and Wolf assume that the discretionary spending caps imposed by the BCA through 2021 will be enforced successfully. These caps imply that discretionary spending will fall to the lowest level relative to GDP since World War II. They would also require both defense and non-defense outlays to grow less than the rate of inflation from 2014 to 2021, after already falling considerably from the levels inflated by the stimulus and the recession.\n\nThe biggest risk is that it will be impossible to maintain defense at such low levels, as demonstrated by the ongoing war on terror and the rapid growth of the Chinese defense budget. In non-defense, population growth will put upward pressure on spending for programs like education, infrastructure, and national parks. True reforms in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid have a better chance of lasting than arbitrary caps on discretionary spending that do not specify individual program cuts.\n\nRudolph G. Penner, an Institute Fellow at the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1983 to 1987, warns that sovereign debt crises occur at all manner of debt-GDP ratios and are impossible to predict. However, it is hard to believe that a higher ratio does not increase the risk to some degree. In 2008, just before their crises, the net debt to GDP ratio in Spain was less than 31 percent and in Ireland less than 25 percent.",
    " Title: Impact of Scalia's Death on Texas Abortion Case and Future Reproductive Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nThe death of Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away over the weekend, may significantly alter the outcome of the upcoming U.S. Supreme Court abortion case, and potentially reshape the future of reproductive rights in the United States.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear its most significant abortion case in at least a decade, concerning a Texas law that requires doctors to have local hospital admitting privileges and clinics to undergo costly building upgrades to operate as outpatient surgical centers. With Scalia's absence, a 4-4 split in the court could leave the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that upheld these provisions in place, potentially leading to the closure of several abortion clinics in Texas.\n\nIlyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, states, \"We would be looking at an even greater healthcare crisis in Texas than we're already facing.\" This situation would exacerbate existing issues, as Texas already has half its clinics closed due to other state-imposed restrictions.\n\nHowever, a 4-4 split decision would not set a national precedent. This means that other appeals court rulings striking down similar laws would also stand. Hogue notes, \"There are so many laws looking to restrict not only abortion access and abortion rights but a broader set of reproductive rights in front of the court right now.\"\n\nAnother significant case set to be heard next month involves a challenge to the Affordable Care Act's mandate on covering birth control for female employees. Additionally, there is a wave of abortion restrictions passed since 2011, with many cases making their way through the appeals courts.\n\nAbortion opponents, who had relied on Scalia's support, view him as a staunch ally in their efforts to restrict abortion. Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel with Americans United for Life, states, \"He was one of the two justices on the court who has publicly opposed Roe v. Wade in prior cases and prior votes.\"\n\nWith a potential liberal majority, Forsythe foresees a significant rollback of decades of abortion restrictions. He suggests that a liberal Supreme Court may overturn the ban on public funding for the procedure, known as the Hyde Amendment, a policy both presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have pledged to overturn.\n\nForsythe also anticipates a liberal Supreme Court \"will probably throw out all parental notice and parental consent laws in the country, will throw out all informed consent laws in the country, and virtually any regulation, and create an absolute right to abortion for any reason at any time that we have not seen in 42 years.\"\n\nAbortion rights groups, however, view these predictions as speculative at best. As both sides prepare for a fierce battle over Scalia's replacement, the future of reproductive rights in the United States hangs in the balance.",
    " Title: Income Growth and Poverty Rate Decline in 2015: A Significant Shift in Economic Trends\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Census Bureau's annual report on household incomes and poverty rates for 2015 has revealed a significant shift in economic trends, with median household income growing by 5.2 percent in real terms, or $2,800, and the poverty rate decreasing from 14.8 percent to 13.5 percent.\n\nAccording to the report, the income growth was particularly pronounced at the lower end of the income distribution. People at the 10th percentile, or the poor, saw their incomes grow by 7.9 percent, compared to a 3.7 percent increase for those at the 95th percentile. This income growth led to a decrease in income inequality between 2014 and 2015, although it does not reverse the long-term upward trend in inequality.\n\nThe report also showed a decline in the supplemental poverty measure (SPM), a metric that takes into account all important social programs and the cost of basic goods like food, clothing, shelter, and utilities. The SPM fell by a full percentage point, from 15.3 percent to 14.3 percent, with 45.7 million people in poverty in 2015, 2.7 million fewer than in 2014.\n\nThe report also highlighted the ongoing rollout of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which continued a trend toward lower and lower uninsured rates. The rate for 2015 was 9.1 percent, and more recent federal data shows that in the first quarter of 2016, that rate fell even further to 8.6 percent, the lowest on record. The drops in uninsurance for poor Americans were concentrated in states that participated in the law's Medicaid expansion, but even non-expanding states saw some declines.\n\nOverall, the report suggests that the gains of the ongoing economic recovery are finally being broadly shared, although it would take multiple reports like this to reverse longstanding trends in income inequality and poor median income growth.",
    " Title: U.S. Capitol Hosts Controversial Netanyahu Speech Amidst Political Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe highly anticipated speech of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the U.S. Congress has become a focal point of political tension, with the Democrats' decision to boycott the address causing a shift in the narrative. Instead of sidelining Netanyahu, as initially intended, the speech has garnered global attention, with the U.S. Capitol now the center of attention.\n\nWhat was once expected to be a one-day story has evolved into a continuing saga, raising questions for President Barack Obama and the Democrats. The Democrats, once staunch supporters of Israel, have recently expressed criticism towards the Jewish state. Secretary of State John F. Kerry has referred to Israel as an \"apartheid state,\" while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has denounced Israel for the \"brutal occupation\" of the West Bank and the deprivation of \"dignity and self-determination\" for the Palestinians.\n\nThe Democrats' cooled stance on Israel has left many wondering about President Obama's motivations, as he prepares to face the plain-spoken Netanyahu. Speculation surrounds potential disclosures that may emerge from discussions between Israel and Obama's administration, with some reports suggesting that Obama once threatened to shoot down Israeli bombers attempting to reach Iranian nuclear reactors.\n\nIn his speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Netanyahu emphasized the longstanding friendship between Israel and the United States, recalling three instances where Israel acted independently to ensure its survival despite American misgivings: the declaration of statehood in 1948, the Six Day War in 1967, and the bombing of the Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981.\n\nThe friendship between the two nations has been a topic of debate, with some questioning the current administration's commitment to Israel. President Obama's perceived indecisiveness and lack of resolve has led to comparisons with Netanyahu, who is known for his robust defense of Israel.\n\nAs Netanyahu delivers his speech to the joint session of Congress, he aims to remind Americans of their nation's exceptional status, as described by Abraham Lincoln, and to challenge President Obama's approach to Israel. The speech is intended to underscore the importance of maintaining a resolute stance in the face of adversity, a message that resonates in times of uncertainty.",
    " Title: World Bank Forecasts Moderate Global Growth Amidst European Sovereign Debt Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe World Bank has released its latest global economic outlook, predicting a slightly more pessimistic growth trajectory compared to other forecasters. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), for instance, forecasts a growth of 3.5 percent in 2012 and 4.1 percent in 2013.\n\nThe global economic outlook brightened early in 2012, as European leaders pledged to allocate more funds to resolve their sovereign debt crisis and implement policy changes to further unite the Continent. This led to a decrease in European bond yields and an increase in investment. However, the tranquility of winter has given way to market volatility in the spring.\n\nInvestors have once again started to punish various European bonds, prompting Spain to request a bailout for its faltering banks last weekend. Political uncertainty is rampant, with a potential Greek exit from the eurozone becoming a more frequent topic of discussion.\n\nIn the last few months, fearful investors have reduced their risk exposure, withdrawing funds from around the world and parking them in the safety of assets like American bonds. Capital flows to developing countries fell an astonishing 44 percent from April to May, according to the World Bank's data.\n\nThe bank expects such market fluctuations to be common in the post-crisis period, and their effects to be felt globally. \"Sharp swings in investor sentiment and financial conditions will continue to complicate the conduct of macro policy in developing countries,\" the report stated.\n\nDespite the challenges, the World Bank anticipates Europe to navigate its sovereign debt crisis without a market catastrophe, and the world to maintain its sluggish but steady growth path. However, the forecast is not entirely reassuring, as economists at the World Bank, like most forecasters, have a history of failing to predict crises.\n\n\"This is the third May or June in a row where Europe has been embroiled in tensions,\" said World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick. \"In each and every previous incident, it has calmed towards the end of June. That is our baseline expectation.\"\n\nThe bank strongly advised developing countries to prepare for market turbulence by strengthening their balance sheets, such as by cutting deficits and reducing short-term debt exposures.\n\nAccording to the bank's data, about 40 percent of developing countries were running a surplus in 2007, before the global downturn began. Last year, just 19 percent were. \"That doesn't mean that their policies have deteriorated,\" Zoellick said, suggesting that the swing was largely the result of the crisis. However, Zoellick noted that the countries' relatively strong fiscal position heading into the crisis served them well, and he urged them to \"move in that direction once again.\"\n\nMore generally, the bank's economists stated that while Europe might pose a short-term threat to middle- and lower-income countries, in the long term, their prospects and growth trajectories remained strong.\n\nIn the case of China, for instance, growth \"doesn't depend on domestic demand in high-income countries, and ultimately it doesn't depend on their export demand,\" said Hans Timmer, the director of the World Bank's development prospects group. Future growth would instead come largely from within the country and other poorer but fast-growing economies, he said.\n\nOfficials at the bank also warned that high-income countries were not making the necessary changes to ensure their economies would be competitive, prolonging their periods of economic malaise and losing ground to the rest of the world. Such changes might include reducing long-term deficits, making certain industries more competitive, or investing in infrastructure.\n\n\"In high-income countries, a good crisis is being wasted,\" said Timmer.\n\nOn Tuesday, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also warned of a global growth slowdown and renewed threats to financial markets.\n\n\"We need a strategy that is good for stability and good for growth,\" said Lagarde at a Center for Global Development event in Washington, according to her prepared remarks. \"This must start with the advanced economies, especially in Europe.\" Lagarde urged \"very accommodating monetary policy,\" \"direct support to banks,\" and \"growth-friendly\" fiscal policies.",
    " Title: Elizabeth Warren Takes Lead in National Democratic Primary Polls, Ahead of Biden and Sanders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in the Democratic primary race, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has surpassed former Vice President Joe Biden in several recent national polls, marking a notable change in the race's dynamics.\n\nAccording to most national polls since the end of September, Warren, who has been consistently growing in strength since the start of her campaign, is now leading the pack. This change is particularly significant as Biden had led in almost every national poll since 2018, often by double-digit margins.\n\nIn the past five polls, Warren has come out on top in four, and in the past ten, she has led in six. The RealClearPolitics average, a frequently cited polling benchmark, now shows Warren ahead of Biden by 0.2%, marking the first time Biden has not held the lead in the race's RCP average since December.\n\nThe most recent poll to place her at the top was released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University. This poll found Warren ahead of Biden 29% to 26%, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont coming in third at 16%. Among those who described themselves as \"very liberal\", Warren led Biden 38% to 26%, and among the \"somewhat\" liberals she led 37% to 23%. Biden led among moderate and conservative Democrats 35% to 22%.\n\nWarren's strong performance extends to the early primary states, which are crucial in securing the nomination. Last month, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll found her leading in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, and a Monmouth University poll put her narrowly ahead of Biden in New Hampshire. A Suffolk University/\u2588\u2588\u2588 Network Poll released on Sept. 24 placed her just 4 points behind Biden in Nevada, the third state where primary voters will cast their ballots.\n\nElizabeth Warren's latest challenge to the presidency comes as she navigates the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Tuesday's poll from Quinnipiac shows that voters approve of the impeachment inquiry 53% to 43% and that 45% think Trump should be removed from office while 49% do not. This shift in opinion is significant, as the margin was 37% to 57% in a Quinnipiac poll before the inquiry launched.\n\nThe poll also reveals that only 34% approve of the way Trump has responded to the impeachment inquiry, compared with 57% who disapprove. However, 43% agreed with the president that it was a \"political witch hunt\", while 51% said it was a \"legitimate investigation\".\n\nAs the race heats up, both Warren and Biden are seen as strong contenders who could beat Trump in a general election. When asked whom they would vote for if the election was held today, Quinnipiac found that both Warren and Biden would beat the incumbent president \u2013 Biden by a margin of 51% to 40%, and Warren by a margin of 49% to 41%.\n\nThe shift in the polls has not gone unnoticed by President Trump, who indirectly acknowledged Warren's rise in a tweet Tuesday, calling on his 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton to \"enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren\".\n\nAs the race continues, Warren will face challenges and criticism from her Democratic rivals, but her consistent growth in the polls and strong performance in early primary states suggest she is a formidable contender in the race for the Democratic nomination.",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Loyalists Face Exclusion from Federal Agencies, Alleging Discrimination and Leaks\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions are rising between Donald Trump's campaign workers and GOP veterans as they compete for key positions in federal agencies, with the former group finding themselves losing out more frequently, according to a report by Politico.\n\nFrom the State Department to the Environmental Protection Agency, campaign staffers, who self-identify as \"originals,\" claim they are being sidelined, as per the website. These individuals allege they have been kept out of meetings and targeted by damaging leaks. A number of Trump supporters, many of whom volunteered to work for him during the campaign, have already resigned from their new roles.\n\nSid Bowdidge, a Trump campaign staffer who reportedly quit his Energy Department job after allegations of anti-Muslim slurs on social media, blames these stories on leaks by rival coworkers, as noted by Politico. Bowdidge stated, \"You're always watching your back.\" He further added, \"How can you when people are looking over their shoulder to see if they have a knife in their back?\"\n\nMany of the campaign loyalists were placed in agencies on Inauguration Day to help smooth the presidential transition. They are often referred to as the \"beachhead\" team. CBS News reports that about a dozen members of the beachhead team at the U.S. Agriculture have been informed they would not receive permanent positions at the department. Other agencies, including Treasury and Transportation, have notified former campaign workers that their jobs are ending, according to the network news.\n\nOne former campaign staffer, who was not offered a full-time role at his agency, commented, \"The perception (among agency staff) is, we were Mr. Trump's goons who were good at knocking on doors, but can't do much else.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some Cabinet secretaries have privately expressed concerns about being forced to take employees with little, if any, relevant expertise, as reported by Politico. However, the Trump loyalists insist they do not deserve to be cast aside.\n\nA former campaign aide lamented, \"As we get further away from Inauguration Day, it is very obvious that no one cares what happens to the people who worked for the campaign or who have loyalty to the president.\" The aide concluded, \"The swamp is winning the battle. And longtime campaign staffers are proving to be the first casualties.\"",
    " Title: Trump Denies Firing Comey Over Russia Investigation, Amidst Ongoing Obstruction of Justice Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a series of tweets on Thursday, President Donald Trump asserted that he did not dismiss FBI Director James Comey due to the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence suggesting otherwise.\n\n\"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!\" Trump tweeted before departing for a fundraising trip to Texas. \"The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!\"\n\nThis statement comes two days after Trump's May 9, 2017, dismissal of Comey. Initially, Trump told NBC News that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had endorsed Comey's firing, but he would have taken the same action without the recommendation, citing Russia as a reason.\n\n\"And, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,'\" Trump told NBC's Lester Holt. \"It\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should\u2019ve won.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded to Trump's claim, tweeting, \"Let's go to the videotape.\"\n\nThe assertion came a day after news broke that former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe authored a memo quoting Rosenstein as saying that Trump asked him to refer to the Russia investigation as a reason for recommending Comey's dismissal.\n\nHowever, the Rosenstein memo focused on Comey's overall management of the bureau, including his handling of the Hillary Clinton private email server case. The day after Comey's firing, Trump reportedly told visiting Russian diplomats that \"I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off.\"\n\nAdditionally, Trump and his aides criticized Comey for stating privately that he was not a subject of investigation but would not say so publicly. Meanwhile, Comey has stated that he believes he was fired because he rebuffed Trump's request to go easy on a central figure in the Russia probe, former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nThe FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election in order to help Trump.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler Outlines Democratic Strategy for Mueller Report Release and Document Requests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on ABC's This Week, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler outlined the Democratic strategy for revealing the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and requested documents from dozens of individuals close to the White House this week. However, Nadler downplayed the possibility of impeaching President Trump, stating that they do not yet have sufficient evidence to initiate impeachment proceedings.\n\nNadler emphasized the importance of convincing the American people before moving forward with impeachment, stating, \"Before you impeach somebody, you have to persuade the American people that it ought to happen.\" He acknowledged that the high bar of convincing Trump supporters they aren't trying to overturn the last election is a significant challenge.\n\nOn Monday, the Democrats will request documents from 60 people, including Donald Trump Jr. and Trump Organization chief financial officer Allan Weisselberg, as part of investigations into obstruction of justice, corruption, and abuse of power. Nadler expressed a desire to see what the special counsel uncovers in terms of Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign, and he plans to subpoena that information if the Justice Department keeps it under wraps.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy countered that Democrats are on a \"fishing expedition\" and will latch onto whatever they can to impeach the president. Despite Nadler's claims, McCarthy asserted that there is no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nNadler responded to these allegations by stating that his side is conducting due diligence after Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, implicated the president in crimes, including pay-offs to a porn actress, Stormy Daniels, on the cusp of the election to cover up an alleged affair. Nadler emphasized that seeking to sabotage a fair election would be an impeachable offense, but they are far from making decisions about that.\n\nMcCarthy, in turn, argued that Cohen, as an attorney, had a responsibility to advise Trump on the law, and any violations would not be impeachable. The ongoing political drama between the two parties continues to unfold as the Democrats push for transparency and the Republicans maintain their support for the president.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Halts Risk Adjustment Payments for Obamacare Insurers, Sparking Industry Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked backlash from the health insurance industry, the Trump administration announced Saturday evening that it is temporarily freezing billions of dollars of payments to health insurance companies intended to help them manage higher-risk patients. The federal government provides Obamacare insurers risk adjustment payments, which are designed to cushion insurers from taking steep losses on high-risk patients in the Obamacare marketplace.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the abrupt halt of these payments Saturday evening, citing a February 2018 ruling from the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico that invalidates them.\n\n\"We were disappointed by the court's recent ruling,\" CMS Administrator Seema Verma said in a statement. \"As a result of this litigation, billions of dollars in risk adjustment payments and collections are now on hold. CMS has asked the court to reconsider its ruling, and hopes for a prompt resolution that allows CMS to prevent more adverse impacts on Americans who receive their insurance in the individual and small group markets.\"\n\nThe insurance industry is already speaking out against the administration's decision, calling it a crucial blow during a time when insurance companies are trying to come up with premiums and packages for 2019.\n\n\"We are very discouraged by the new market disruption brought about by the decision to freeze risk adjustment payments. This decision comes at a critical time when insurance providers are developing premiums for 2019 and states are reviewing rates,\" trade group America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) said in a statement Saturday. \"We encourage the Administration to reevaluate its decision and work with all stakeholders to make health care more affordable for all Americans.\"\n\nInsurers themselves are voicing concerns for market destabilization following the announcement.\n\n\"This action will significantly increase 2019 premiums for millions of individuals and small business owners and could result in far fewer health plan choices,\" Blue Cross Blue Shield Association President and CEO Scott Serota said in a statement. \"It will undermine Americans' access to affordable coverage, particularly those who need medical care the most.\"\n\nOver the course of his first 18 months in office, the president has targeted Obamacare with a series of moves intended to undermine the system and disrupt the marketplace. The president has rolled back funding for a program intended to help individuals navigate the insurance marketplace, Obamacare's navigator program, signed an executive order to allow for groups to purchase insurance across state lines, stopped federal funding for Obamacare subsidies, pushed for consumer access to more affordable short-term, limited duration health insurance plans, cut Obamacare's open enrollment period in half and its advertising budget 90 percent.\n\nTrump made repealing and replacing Obamacare a key part of his successful bid for the presidency in 2016, but he has, thus far, been unable to materialize that goal. House Republicans passed a bill \u2014 the American Health Care Act \u2014 in May 2017 after a few months of rocky negotiations that nearly stopped the effort in its tracks. Senate Republicans had a more difficult time, given their 52- and subsequently slim 51-seat majority in the upper chamber. The Senate tried roughly a handful of times in 2017 to repeal and replace Obamacare, offering up a \"skinny repeal\" in July 2017 with no replacement as a last-ditch effort to overhaul the American health care system. That, too, failed to pass muster within the entirety of either the Republican or Democratic conferences.\n\nUltimately, Republicans and the White House have moved on from repealing and replacing Obamacare, although a coalition of outside conservative groups have hopes of reviving the debate in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear he is ready to move on from the issue, but he has said he would entertain a proposal that was guaranteed to get enough votes to pass.",

Alexander Vindman Recalled Amidst Impeachment Inquiry\n\nIn a series of personnel moves that have been met with bipartisan criticism, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, both key witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry, have been recalled.\n\nIn a statement released Friday, Ambassador Sondland announced, \"I was advised today that the president intends to recall me effective immediately as United States Ambassador to the European Union.\" He expressed gratitude to President Trump \"for having given me the opportunity to serve.\"\n\nThe statement comes hours after Lt. Col. Vindman, another witness in the impeachment inquiry, was ousted from his White House job with the National Security Council.\n\nDuring the House impeachment inquiry, Ambassador Sondland testified that \"everyone was in the loop\" about an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden. This allegation forms the crux of the Democrats' impeachment case against the president.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat, commented, \"Firing Ambassador Sondland and a hero like LTC Vindman for telling the truth is yet more abuse of power by the president.\" He further tweeted, \"These self-serving acts won\u2019t stop until Donald Trump is out of office, or Republicans finally decide to stand up against this petty retaliation.\"\n\nTom Fitton, an ally of the president who heads the watchdog group Judicial Watch, approvingly referred to the personnel moves as \"cleaning house.\"\n\nSen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, described the ousters of Ambassador Sondland, Lt. Col. Vindman, and his twin brother, Yevgeny, from the National Security Council as \"clear political retaliation, the likes of which is seen only in authoritarian countries around the world.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, noted that Ambassador Sondland is a political appointee who serves at the pleasure of the president. He tweeted, \"No point in having a political appointee who no longer has the President's confidence.\" Regarding Lt. Col. Vindman, Sen. Rubio stated, \"He was assigned to NSC to serve the President who has a right to have people he trusts on his staff.\"\n\nThe ousters of Ambassador Sondland and Lt. Col. Vindman have sparked widespread criticism and concern, with many viewing these moves as an attempt to silence witnesses and obstruct the impeachment inquiry. The developments underscore the ongoing political tension and the high stakes of the impeachment process.",
    " Title: \"Rove Critiques Affordable Care Act: Unintended Consequences of Job Hours and Self-Funded Health Plans\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal, Republican strategist Karl Rove argues that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has several unintended negative consequences. One of these consequences, according to Rove, is a shift in job hours, with more part-time and fewer full-time jobs being created.\n\nRove points out that the Affordable Care Act requires companies with at least 50 employees to provide health insurance to any employee working more than 30 hours a week or face a fine. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of hourly employees working 30-34 hours a week has decreased by an average of 146,500 per month over the past year, while the number working 25-29 hours has increased by 119,000 per month.\n\nRove suggests that this lack of hours can particularly impact single working mothers and younger workers. He also argues that the 50-employee threshold may discourage businesses from growing beyond that size, leading the U.S. to follow in the footsteps of countries with slower economies, such as France.\n\nAnother issue Rove raises is the impact of Obamacare on businesses with self-funded health plans. These companies act as their own insurer, collecting premiums and paying claims filed by their workers. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 61 percent of workers are in self-funded plans. Rove claims that these companies have an incentive to choose self-funding because the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) governs self-funded plans, not the Affordable Care Act.\n\nERISA allows self-funded plans to charge premiums based on risk, offer a wider menu of options, and avoid expensive provisions such as Obamacare's new tax on insurance policies. However, Rove notes that Obamacare supporters are not fond of the success of these programs in curbing premium increases and managing costs. He mentions that Delaware, New York, and Oregon have already prohibited small- and mid-size companies from using self-insurance plans.\n\nRove also expresses concern that the new Labor Secretary, Thomas Perez, may issue regulations that erode the attractiveness of self-funded plans and push more companies' health policies into Obamacare's system.\n\nFinally, Rove states that the number of uninsured Americans will not drop below 30 million in the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, contradicting Obamacare's promise of \"universal\" coverage.",
    " Title: Court Documents Reveal Trump University's Sales Techniques and Media Guidelines\n\nArticle:\n\nA collection of hundreds of pages of court documents related to Trump University, the real estate and investment training venture of former President Donald Trump, has been released by a federal judge this week. The documents, which include a detailed guide for selling courses and mentoring sessions, as well as dealing with the media, were made available in response to a request from The Washington Post.\n\nThe documents, which span several years, can be categorized into two main sections: depositions from Trump University executives and \"playbooks\" - marketing and strategy plans for selling courses and mentoring sessions. The playbooks emphasize the selling of the \"Gold\" level courses, which cost nearly $35,000.\n\nThe topics covered in the Trump University documents range from expense reporting to sales strategies in various environments, from one-off preview events to three-day sessions. The majority of the pages are marked \"Confidential.\"\n\nThe 2008 edition of the playbook includes tips for dealing with the media, starting with directing any reporters to a Trump media contact. The guide also suggests that courtesy gets you a long way.\n\nThe playbooks, which span several years, also include Trump University employees' suggested responses to customers who balk at a sale, offering rebuttals to objections that range from a need to consult a spouse to a reluctance to go into debt.\n\nThe 2010 Playbook also requires sales staff to \"Be Deliberate.\" Here's that paragraph:\n\n\"Be deliberate and conscious when communicating to potential students. Remember that we have time to think and plan and develop questions and commands that lead people into a flow that they must deal with and respond to. Without a game plan you are required to respond to them and do much more thinking on your feet. Remember that we need to stay on 'offense.'\"\n\nThe playbook also advises Trump's sales teams not to let a lack of money be used as an excuse for turning down Trump University's three-day training.\n\n\"Money is never a reason for not enrolling in Trump University,\" the sales guide states, adding, \"if they really believe in you and your product, they will find the money.\"\n\nThe documents and records were ordered to be released by U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of the Southern District of California, who has been a target of personal attacks from Donald Trump. Trump previously questioned whether Curiel's Hispanic heritage made him biased due to Trump's support for building a wall on the Mexican border.\n\nThe documents stem from lawsuits filed by Trump University's customers back in 2013; their case gained new prominence back in February, when Trump's Republican rival Marco Rubio brought them up during a debate. After that debate, Michael Isikoff, the chief investigative correspondent for Yahoo! News, spoke to NPR's Robert Siegel about the former students' complaints against Trump.",
    " Title: Mistrial Declared in Corruption Trial of New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the corruption trial of New Jersey's Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Menendez ended in a mistrial on Thursday, as the jury reported an impasse, unable to reach a unanimous verdict on bribery, fraud, and other charges. The hung jury marks a victory for Menendez and a setback for federal prosecutors in what was the Justice Department's first high-profile corruption trial since the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last year that limited the department's ability to bring such cases.\n\nMenendez, a 63-year-old political veteran who has been a senator since 2006, was accused of accepting private flights, campaign contributions, and other bribes from a wealthy Florida ophthalmologist, Salomon Melgen, in exchange for official favors. One juror, Ed Norris, revealed to reporters that the panel was split 10-2 in favor of acquittal, which could discourage the government from pursuing a second trial.\n\nThe Justice Department has yet to announce whether it will seek to retry Menendez, who is expected to run for re-election next year. In a statement, the department said it would \"carefully consider next steps.\" Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, called for the Senate's ethics committee to investigate the allegations against Menendez. The committee confirmed it would resume its inquiry, which was put on hold in 2013 to allow the criminal probe to proceed.\n\nA tearful Menendez thanked God, his family, the jurors, and two senators who testified on his behalf as character witnesses, Democrat Cory Booker and Republican Lindsey Graham, outside the courthouse in Newark, New Jersey. \"The way this case started was wrong,\" said Menendez, flanked by his grown children. \"The way it was investigated was wrong. The way it was prosecuted was wrong. The way it was tried was wrong as well.\"\n\nThe mistrial provides at least a temporary measure of relief for Menendez's Democratic colleagues in the Senate, where Republicans would likely have pushed for resignation or expulsion if Menendez had been convicted. The case was seen as a test for prosecutors in the wake of last year's Supreme Court ruling that vacated the bribery conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. In doing so, the high court narrowed the grounds for corruption cases.\n\nDuring the 10-week trial, prosecutors accused Menendez of pressuring Medicare officials to change the agency's billing practices after it concluded that Melgen overbilled it by millions of dollars. Melgen, Menendez's co-defendant in the corruption trial, was separately convicted in Florida earlier this year of a massive Medicare fraud. According to the government, Menendez also helped secure visas for the married Melgen's foreign girlfriends and asked U.S. officials to resolve a port dispute in the Dominican Republic involving one of Melgen's businesses. In exchange, Melgen allegedly showered the senator with luxury vacations and hundreds of thousands of campaign dollars. Defense attorneys argued that prosecutors cherry-picked gifts exchanged between close friends to suggest impropriety when none existed.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Community Warns of Ongoing Russian Election Meddling, Calls for Congressional Action\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has issued a stark warning that President Putin has personally ordered a campaign to undermine American democracy and sow chaos in the electoral system. This assertion, made with high confidence, follows a series of well-documented Russian efforts to hack political organizations and state election boards, as well as disinformation campaigns on social media platforms.\n\nRussia, as a perceived adversary not only to the United States but to freedom-loving people worldwide, has been employing disinformation and chaos as a tactic since the Soviet era. This strategy, updated with modern tools, has resulted in a widespread proliferation of Russian disinformation throughout the Western world. From elections in Britain, France, and Montenegro to invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, Moscow has pursued an aggressive foreign policy aimed at spreading disorder and expanding Russian influence in states that were once under the control of Soviet Communism.\n\nThe threat of Russian meddling in U.S. elections is not a relic of the past. Just last week, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, cautioned that \"the warning lights are blinking red\" that Russia and other adversaries will continue to launch cyberattacks on the digital infrastructure, including many energy companies in South and West Texas.\n\nIn response to these threats, many of the author's constituents have inquired about the role Congress can play in protecting the American people and providing a check on the executive branch's actions following the Helsinki summit. The author suggests that Congress could take the lead on European security issues, as it has in recent years.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, Congress repeatedly pressured the president, using the power of the purse through appropriations bills, to send lethal weaponry to assist Ukraine in its fight against Russian-backed separatists. Last year, Congress passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act to impose severe sanctions on Russia as a response to its meddling in the U.S. presidential election. This year, the House passed the Ukraine Cybersecurity Cooperation Act to enhance Ukraine's ability to respond to Russian-supported disinformation and propaganda efforts.\n\nThe author is also optimistic about the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations' decision to invite Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to testify on the president's recent meetings with Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin. This transparency is crucial in maintaining a balanced and informed discussion on foreign policy matters.",
    " Title: An Unbiased Analysis of the Leaked 1995 Trump Tax Returns and the Implications for the Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the New York Times published a report based on a leaked 1995 Donald Trump tax return, revealing a significant financial loss of over $900 million. This revelation has sparked a heated debate, with some viewing it as a potential political blow to the Republican presidential nominee, while others argue that it is a common business practice.\n\nThe tax return, which shows a loss that could have allowed Trump to carry forward against taxable income for up to 18 years, has raised questions about Trump's business acumen and financial stability. The report suggests that Trump's substantial losses were a result of poor investments in the Atlantic City gaming and tourism market in the early 1990s.\n\nWhile the tax return itself may not necessarily paint Trump in a negative light, the manner in which it was obtained has sparked controversy. The leak, which is believed to have originated from within Trump's inner circle, has been criticized for violating the candidate's right to privacy and potentially breaching confidentiality agreements.\n\nIt is important to note that the practice of carrying forward losses to offset future taxable income is a common business strategy. According to the Tax Foundation, about 1 million taxpayers had a net operating loss (NOL) in 1995, a result of business deductions exceeding business income in a particular year. Under tax rules, this loss can be carried back up to two years and carried forward up to twenty years.\n\nThe use of NOLs is not unique to Trump, as the New York Times and Hillary Clinton have also made use of this tax strategy. The practice is legal and serves as a means for businesses to hold onto their money during lean years and reinvest during profitable periods.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the leak of Trump's tax return has diverted attention from the issues at hand and has raised questions about the ethics of political journalism. It is crucial that the identity of the leaker is uncovered and the villain is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nRegardless of one's political leanings, it is essential to uphold the rule of law and respect the privacy rights of American citizens. The leak of Trump's tax return, while potentially damaging to his campaign, does not pose a threat to our freedom or the rule of law. However, the outlaw character of those who conspired to violate Trump's confidentiality is a matter of concern for all Americans.",
    " Title: Trump Transition Team Accuses Special Counsel Mueller's Office of Unlawful Obtaining of Emails; Mueller's Team Denies Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a seven-page letter sent to the Senate Homeland Security Committee and the House Oversight Committee, Kory Langhofer, attorney for President Donald Trump's transition team, has accused the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office of unlawfully obtaining tens of thousands of emails from the General Services Administration (GSA). The GSA, which holds all transition documents, allegedly handed over the requested \"copies of emails, laptops, cell phones, and other materials\" of 13 members of the transition team, despite the agency not owning or controlling the records in question.\n\nLanghofer claimed that the transition team was never informed that the documents were handed over, and there were potential violations of attorney-client privilege as well as the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unlawful search and seizure. Axios reports that the transition emails are said to include sensitive exchanges on matters such as potential appointments, gossip about the views of particular senators involved in the confirmation process, speculation about vulnerabilities of Trump nominees, strategizing about press statements, and policy planning on everything from war to taxes.\n\nA source told Axios that the transition team will be sending a letter to Mueller asking for some emails to be returned because they're privileged. However, Mueller's team has pushed back, with spokesman Peter Carr stating, \"When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner's consent or appropriate criminal process.\"\n\nGSA Deputy Counsel Lenny Loewentritt also contradicted the claims made by Trump's transition team. Loewentritt specifically rejected a claim by the transition lawyer that the late GSA general counsel made a commitment to inform Trump's team if there were specific requests for any documents because the campaign \"owned and controlled\" emails that were sent at the time. In an interview with BuzzFeed, Loewentritt said that the truth is the exact opposite because the transition team was clearly told that \"in using our devices,\" materials \"would not be held back in any law enforcement\" actions.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti took to Twitter to explain why Trump's transition team is \"playing politics\" but the issue itself \"is a bad sign for them.\" Mariotti wrote that what is unusual in this case is that Mueller's team got the emails from the GSA rather than the Trump transition. He suggests that \"Mueller was concerned that he wouldn't receive all of the emails if he obtained them from the Trump team,\" which, according to Mariotti, \"suggests that he has reason to distrust Trump's team.\"\n\nMariotti also noted that disputes over privilege are common when prosecutors obtain emails and documents from third parties. He wrote, \"The biggest conclusion I'd draw from their letter is that they're concerned about Mueller's investigation and are doing whatever they can to discredit it.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell also dismissed the supposed complaints by the transition team as much ado about nothing, writing on Twitter, \"Private documents on a U.S. Government, public email system? What are they afraid was found? Baloney. This is another attempt to discredit Mueller as his #TrumpRussia probe tightens.\"",
    " Title: John Bolton's Departure from Trump Administration: A Closer Look at His Decision to Testify\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, John Bolton, former National Security Advisor to President Donald Trump, has decided to testify before the Senate in the ongoing impeachment trial. This move comes after months of speculation about his stance on the matter.\n\nBolton's decision to testify could be seen as a departure from the Trump administration, a move that was reportedly prompted by his disagreements with the President's foreign policy decisions and actions. In 2018, when Trump mused about withdrawing the United States from NATO, Bolton was said to have been distressed and worked to prevent it. His disagreements with Trump's foreign policy extend to the President's relationship with Russia, with Bolton reportedly characterizing Trump's meddling with aid to Ukraine as a \"drug deal.\"\n\nBolton's professional principles, honed over a career in government, may have also played a role in his decision. As a seasoned government professional, Bolton has an informed respect for the institutional architecture and ethos of American foreign policy. Before becoming Trump's National Security Advisor, he served as Ambassador to the United Nations, Undersecretary of State, Assistant Secretary of State, and Assistant Attorney General.\n\nHowever, speculation also suggests that personal indignation and financial gain could have influenced Bolton's decision. He reportedly lobbied the President for the National Security Advisor job for years and received a reported $2 million advance for his upcoming book, due out on March 17. The revelations in the book are expected to make it an instant bestseller.\n\nDespite the potential for personal gain, it is likely that Bolton's sense of patriotic duty and professional principles played a more significant role in his decision. Bolton served almost a year and a half in a job under a famously mercurial President, and towards the end, was reportedly unhappy in it. His book, which didn't need the impeachment trial revelation to make it a hot item or line his pockets, suggests a more honorable motivation behind his decision.\n\nIn conclusion, John Bolton's decision to testify before the Senate in the impeachment trial is a complex one, driven by a combination of personal, professional, and patriotic factors. While the financial gain from his book is a factor, it is unlikely to be the primary motivation for his decision.",
    " Title: Civil Rights Leader Jesse Jackson Criticizes Lack of Focus on Everyday People's Issues in Presidential Debates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588, civil rights leader and activist Rev. Jesse Jackson expressed his disappointment over the lack of discussion on key issues, such as poverty and gun violence, in the presidential and vice presidential debates.\n\nJackson criticized the candidates for focusing on reconciliation of a $5 trillion dollar figure, a sum he described as incomprehensible, while ignoring the impact of foreclosed housing driving the middle class into poverty. He argued that the moderators missed opportunities to discuss issues like controlling semi-automatic weapons and poverty in areas where these subjects are particularly relevant.\n\n\"With their questions, if you have a debate in Denver, how can you miss semi-automatic weapons in Aurora, which is [near] Denver and Columbine? How can you have a debate in Kentucky and don't mention poverty?\" Jackson said, referencing shootings in both locations.\n\nThe poorest county in America is in Kentucky, the state that hosted the vice presidential debate, according to Jackson. He also pointed out that not one moderator has raised the issue of poverty or the issue of low credit scores, with 50 million people living in poverty and another 50 million having a credit score so low they can't borrow money from banks.\n\nJackson also expressed frustration with the scarce attention given to \"voter suppression\" during the debates. He stated, \"The most glaring omission from the discussion is, you can conceivably win the debate and lose the election because of the impact of voter suppression and roll purging.\"\n\nDespite his criticisms, Jackson had high praise for President Obama's performance in Tuesday's presidential debate, describing him as \"alive and vibrant\" and \"punching and counterpunching.\"\n\nRegarding his son, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.), who is currently on medical leave and under criminal investigation, Jackson said, \"My son is still recovering and under medical supervision.\"",
    " Title: Joe Biden Criticizes Trump's Handling of Coronavirus Pandemic, Emphasizes Unity and Cooperation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly anticipated public address on the coronavirus pandemic, former Vice President Joe Biden took aim at President Donald Trump's administration, criticizing its response to the crisis while emphasizing the need for unity and cooperation.\n\nDuring his speech on Thursday, Biden, who is widely expected to secure the Democrat nomination, did not shy away from criticizing the current administration's handling of the pandemic. He accused the administration of ignoring science, having an \"adversarial relationship with the truth,\" and promoting racism.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this virus has laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,\" Biden said. \"Public fears are being compounded by a pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by an adversarial relationship with the truth.\"\n\nBiden proposed that leadership that is open-minded and willing to cooperate across national boundaries is crucial to combat the virus. He argued that the government's ability to respond effectively has been undermined by the Trump administration's actions, including the hollowing out of agencies and the disparagement of science.\n\n\"Our ability to derive a global response is dramatically undercut by the damage Trump has done to our credibility and our relationships around the world,\" Biden said.\n\nWhile many of the solutions Biden proposed are already being implemented by the federal government, he accused Trump of sowing fear and racial division. In particular, Biden claimed that Trump's attempt to hold China accountable for failing to contain the virus were emboldening racism and \"xenophobia.\"\n\n\"Labeling COVID-19 a 'foreign virus' does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration,\" Biden said. \"Let me be crystal clear: the coronavirus does not have a political affiliation.\"\n\nBiden also condemned acts of racism and xenophobia against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, stating that they must not be tolerated.\n\nThe speech came a day after the Biden campaign unveiled its \"Public Health Advisory Committee,\" which is tasked with providing the former vice president guidance on the pandemic. The political leanings of some of the individuals tapped for the committee were made evident by a plan Biden touted on Thursday, which included among its proposals for combatting the virus the rejoining of the Paris climate accord.",
    " Title: Pennsylvania Woman Dies in Jail While Serving Sentence for Unpaid School Fines: A Call to Question the Criminalization of Poverty\n\nA 55-year-old Pennsylvania woman, Eileen DiNino, passed away in a Berks County jail cell over the weekend while serving a 48-hour sentence for unpaid school fines related to her children's attendance. The cause of her death is yet to be determined, but it is not considered suspicious.\n\nDistrict Judge Dean Patton, who expressed reluctance in sentencing DiNino, stated to the Associated Press, \"We don't do debtors' prisons anymore. That went out 100 years ago.\" However, more than 1,600 people have been jailed in Berks County alone due to similar fines, with the majority being women.\n\nDiNino, a mother of seven, was reportedly struggling financially and did not work or appear to have much help with four children still at home. She frequently missed hearings or arrived without the necessary documents. Judge Patton described her as a woman who \"cared about her kids, but her kids ruled the roost.\"\n\nDespite her struggles, DiNino presented herself clean and neat when she surrendered to serve her sentence on Friday. \"She was a different person. She was cleaned up, smiling,\" Patton said, adding that he believes she realized the weight was lifted off her shoulders upon completion of the sentence.\n\nBerks County Commissioner Kevin Barnhardt, chairman of the county prison board, expressed outrage that DiNino died alone and away from her family while serving a sentence for being poor. \"This woman died in prison, away from her family,\" Barnhardt told the Reading Eagle. \"And for what?\"\n\nThe circumstances of DiNino's death serve as a stark reminder of the criminalization of poverty in the United States. Thousands have been jailed in Berks County for failure to pay truancy fines, while court fees and other fines have put thousands of others behind bars across the country.\n\nAn investigation by National Public Radio revealed instances such as a homeless man being sentenced to a year in jail for inability to pay a $2,600 penalty for shoplifting a $2 can of beer, and a teenager being jailed for three days for catching a fish off-season due to an unpaid fine.\n\nThe tragic death of Eileen DiNino raises questions about the justice system's treatment of the economically disadvantaged and the criminalization of poverty in the United States.",
    " Title: Three American Detainees Return Home from North Korea, Clearing Path for Trump-Kim Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, three American citizens, who were previously detained in North Korea, have been released and returned home early Thursday morning. The prisoners, who were welcomed by President Donald Trump and his wife Melania, were handed over to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during his visit to Pyongyang on Tuesday.\n\nThe three men, Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song, and Kim Sang Dok (also known as Tony Kim), are Korean-American and share the common surname Kim, but are not related. They were greeted at Joint Base Andrews by an American flag strung between two fire trucks parked on the tarmac, and their homecoming was broadcast live on cable news networks.\n\nKim Dong Chul, who was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor in 2016 for espionage, expressed his gratitude upon returning home. \"It's like a dream,\" he said through a translator. \"We are very, very happy.\"\n\nThe return of these prisoners, whom the U.S. has called \"hostages,\" clears an obstacle for direct talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The president expects to announce a date and location for the summit within days and has ruled out the Korea Peninsula's Demilitarized Zone. An administration official later stated that he is leaning toward Singapore as the summit location.\n\nTrump thanked Kim for releasing the men and expressed optimism about the upcoming summit. \"I really think we have a very good chance of doing something very meaningful,\" Trump said. \"I really think he wants to do something and bring that country into the real world.\"\n\nSenator Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, cautioned against celebrating prematurely. \"We're not there yet,\" King said on CNN.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who joined Trump at the homecoming, stated that all three men \"seem to be in good health\" and were glad to be heading home. Pence also spoke with the parents of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who was detained in North Korea for trying to steal a propaganda poster from a hotel and died shortly after being returned home in a coma last year.\n\nAfter meeting Trump and Pence, the former detainees were taken to Walter Reed military hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, for evaluation and treatment. Vice President Pence is scheduled to sit for interviews with NBC, ABC, and CBS to be broadcast on their morning news programs.\n\nPence also stated during an interview with CBS News that Kim's agreement to release the three gives hope that this may be different from past negotiations with North Korea, where promises were made but not kept.",
    " Title: CNN Dismisses Donna Brazile: A Call for Reevaluation of Paid Political Pundits in News Media\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, CNN has terminated the contract of Donna Brazile, the former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, following the revelation of her leaking debate questions to the Hillary Clinton campaign. The decision, while appropriate in light of Brazile's actions, has brought to light a broader issue within the news media: the reliance on paid partisan pundits.\n\nAccording to leaked emails from the Podesta hack, Brazile provided the Clinton campaign with advance knowledge of debate questions, as evidenced by an email with the subject line, \"From time to time I get the questions in advance.\" In another email, she previewed a question that would be asked by a Flint resident, inquiring about Clinton's plans for the city.\n\nBrazile's actions were wrong, and her breach of trust is undeniable. While CNN hired her to represent and advocate for the Democratic Party, her actions directly compromised the integrity of CNN, a clear violation of the implied oath of partisanship. Brazile's deceit has exposed a troubling aspect of news talk, one that may not be easily remedied as she is now being scrutinized by the ethics committee.\n\nThe issue at hand is not just Brazile's corrupt act, but the entire ecosystem of paid partisan yakkers that populates news shows. These individuals, who include figures such as Tim Russert, Bill Bradley, George Stephanopoulos, Joe Scarborough, and many more, are not hired for their political insights but for their recognizable faces and predictable commentary.\n\nThe presence of these partisan contributors creates an illusion of impartiality and inclusion, as they are divided between Republicans and Democrats. In reality, they provide safe and predictable chatter, filling airtime with platitudes and generalizations. Their role in the news shows is a result of practicality, as they are a cheap and readily available source of on-air talent for the 24/7 programming needs of television.\n\nThe contributions of these paid pundits are not journalism, nor are they politics. They often dilute political conversations to the weakest of teas, making it difficult for the average viewer to follow. The paid contributor segments are, more often than not, a tasteless and uninformative filler, offering little value to the political discourse.\n\nIt is time for news shows to reconsider their reliance on political hacks and instead hire journalists whose job it would be to extract meaningful information from these pundits. Under this new system, Brazile and others like her could still be interviewed, but they would no longer be paid, and they would be held accountable for providing substantive and valuable insights.\n\nAs Donna Brazile reflects on her actions and the consequences that followed, it is a reminder of the need for transparency, accountability, and integrity in the news media. The dismissal of Brazile should serve as a catalyst for change, pushing news shows to prioritize journalism over partisanship and to hold their contributors to a higher standard.",
    " Title: SeaTac, Washington, to Implement Highest Minimum Wage in the Nation, Sparking Job Cuts and Business Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the debate on increasing the federal minimum wage continues in Washington D.C., the city of SeaTac, Washington, is set to establish the highest minimum wage rate in the nation, starting on January 1. Approximately 1,600 hotel and transportation workers in SeaTac will see their pay rise to $15 per hour, a 60% increase from the state's current minimum wage of $9.32.\n\nWhile many workers welcome the higher pay, employers are grappling with the significant increase in labor costs. Some are considering job cuts as a means to absorb the increased expenses. Cedarbrook Lodge General Manager Scott Ostrander stated, \"We're going to be looking at making some serious cuts. We're going to be looking at reducing employee hours, reducing benefits, and eliminating some positions.\"\n\nIn the short term, these job cuts are expected, but the Cedarbrook Lodge plans to offset the higher labor costs by building an addition to the hotel. The aim is to increase revenue to compensate for the increased wages. However, not every employer is as ambitious. One has announced plans to close one of its two restaurants, eliminating 200 jobs.\n\nThe SeaTac minimum wage increase has also caused Han Kim, who runs Hotel Concepts, a company that owns and manages 11 hotels in Washington state, to postpone plans to build a hotel in SeaTac. The company already has three hotels in SeaTac, and Kim and a business partner were looking to build a fourth on land they own. \"Uncertainty is bad for business, and right now we're right in that area, so we're just putting everything on hold,\" Kim said.\n\nOpponents of the $15 minimum wage scored a legal victory last week when a King County, Washington, judge ruled that it does not apply to any of the workers at the SeaTac airport. Superior Court Judge Andrea Darvas ruled that only the Port of Seattle can set wage and other work rules at the airport, eliminating 4,700 workers from the successful ballot initiative.\n\nBackers of the $15 minimum wage have vowed to appeal the ruling up to the state Supreme Court. One of the biggest supporters is Kshama Sawant, a socialist who also won her election to the Seattle City Council. She plans on making Seattle the next city to have a $15 minimum wage. \"There may be a few jobs lost here and there, but the fact is, if we don't fight for this, then the race to the bottom will continue,\" Sawant said.\n\nSawant is skeptical that the higher minimum wage will lead to mass layoffs. However, the American Car Rental Association estimates that 5% of low-wage jobs will be cut, and another 5-10% of those workers will be replaced by more experienced workers. The owner of Dollar Rental Cars told Fox News she will outsource some functions, change schedules, and cut some staff in response to the new policy.",
    " Title: Minneapolis Mayor and City Council Members Diverge on Police Department's Future Amid Ongoing Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and a majority of the city council members find themselves at odds over the future of the city's police department, following the death of George Floyd. On Sunday, Frey reiterated his stance against abolishing the police force, while a veto-proof majority of city council members expressed their desire to take that drastic step.\n\nFrey, who ordered the evacuation of a police station during the riots last month, faced a hostile crowd outside his home on Saturday. Protesters shouted him down when he defied their demands to dismantle the city's police forces entirely.\n\n\"I'll work relentlessly with Chief [Medaria] Arradondo and alongside the community toward deep, structural reform and addressing systemic racism in police culture,\" Frey said in a statement to KARE. \"We're ready to dig in and enact more community-led, public safety strategies on behalf of our city. But, I do not support abolishing the Minneapolis Police Department.\"\n\nBefore the crowd, Frey had prefaced his comments by saying he was \"coming to grips\" with his \"own brokenness,\" and by promising to put the police union \"in its place.\" However, many protesters were unconvinced, shouting, \"It's not about you!\" and \"Go home, Jacob, go home!\"\n\nOn Sunday, nine city council members spoke at a protest at Powderhorn Park, a neighborhood in Minneapolis. The number of supporters in attendance represented a veto-proof majority to push the measure through, according to Fox 9. Council President Lisa Bender, VP Andrea Jenkins, and Councilmembers Alondra Cano, Jeremiah Ellison, Steve Fletcher, Phillipe Cunningham, Cam Gordon, and Jeremy Schroeder were among those in attendance.\n\nCouncilmember Jeremiah Ellison, the son of state Attorney General Keith Ellison, has openly declared his support for Antifa, the left-wing group that President Trump has sought to designate as a terrorist organization. Most members of the city council have belonged to the Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party.\n\n\"Our commitment is to end our city's toxic relationship with the Minneapolis Police Department,\" Bender said. \"It is clear that our system of policing is not keeping our communities safe. Our efforts at incremental reform have failed, period.\"\n\nBender went on to say she and the eight other council members that joined the rally were committed to ending the city's relationship with the police force and \"to end policing as we know it and recreate systems that actually keep us safe.\"\n\nOn Monday, Bender told CNN that people worried about having no one to call during a home invasion were speaking from a \"place of privilege.\" Those comments drew widespread backlash.\n\nEllison, for his part, promised that the council would \"dismantle\" the department.\n\nNationally, efforts to defund the police have been broadly unpopular, with only about 20 percent of Americans favoring reductions in police forces. Citing publicly available data, commentators have asserted that the very idea of systemic racism by police is questionable.\n\nIn 2018, African-Americans made up 53% of known homicide offenders in the U.S. and committed about 60% of robberies, though they are 13% of the population, according to Heather Mac Donald's article in The Wall Street Journal this week. In 2018, there were 7,407 black homicide victims. Assuming a comparable number of victims last year, those nine unarmed black victims of police shootings represent 0.1% of all African-Americans killed in 2019. By contrast, a police officer is 18\u00bd times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer.\n\nMac Donald continued, \"A 2015 Justice Department analysis of the Philadelphia Police Department found that white police officers were less likely than black or Hispanic officers to shoot unarmed black suspects. Research by Harvard economist Roland G. Fryer Jr. also found no evidence of racial discrimination in shootings.\" Any evidence to the contrary fails to take into account crime rates and civilian behavior before and during interactions with police.\n\nFryer's work has also determined that when police pull out of communities, black deaths tend to increase. \"The false narrative of systemic police bias resulted in targeted killings of officers during the Obama presidency,\" Mac Donald concluded.\n\nDisbanding an entire department has happened before. In 2012, with crime rampant in Camden, New Jersey, the city disbanded its ineffective union-run police department and replaced it with a new force that covered Camden County. Compton, California, took the same step in 2000, shifting its policing to Los Angeles County.\n\nThe move to defund or abolish the Minneapolis department is far from assured, with the civil rights investigation likely to unfold over the next several months.",
    " Title: Voter Fraud Ring Busted in Los Angeles: Nine Accused of Forging Signatures for Ballot Measures and Voter Registration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a voter fraud ring has been uncovered in Los Angeles, with nine individuals accused of forging signatures on state ballot measure petitions and voter registration forms. The defendants, who face several criminal charges including circulating a petition with fake names, voter fraud, and registering a fictitious person, reportedly lured the homeless with cash and cigarettes in exchange for their signatures.\n\nThe district attorney's office announced the charges on Tuesday, three weeks after they were filed but made public only recently. The alleged fraud scheme, which took place on L.A.'s skid row during the 2016 election cycle and this year, was part of a Los Angeles Police Department crackdown on suspected election fraud on skid row earlier in the year.\n\nOfficer Deon Joseph, the senior lead officer on skid row, told The Times in September, \"They paid individuals to sign the names. That's an assault on our democracy.\"\n\nLA elections chief, Dean Logan, told the publication that he is confident his staff, which manually compares signatures, did not let the forgeries slip through. However, he expressed concern about any activity that shakes the trust of the voter in our system.\n\nThis incident is not an isolated one, as voter fraud does occur in the United States. Similar incidents have been reported in states like Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. The issue, though not common, has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that it doesn't happen often, while others maintain that even rare instances of voter fraud can undermine the integrity of the electoral process.",
    " Title: Trump Attorney Michael Cohen Revealed as Third Client: Fox News Host Sean Hannity\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, it has been revealed that Donald Trump's longtime attorney, Michael Cohen, has been representing Fox News host Sean Hannity. This information was unveiled in a federal court on Monday.\n\nFederal Judge Kimba Wood ordered Cohen's legal team to disclose the identity of a client that Cohen's team had withheld in earlier court documents. The disclosure was part of a dispute over evidence seized by the FBI from Cohen's home and office earlier this month.\n\nCohen and Trump had sought either to permit them to review the material before prosecutors got to see it or to appoint an independent \"special master.\" The judge stated that she could not decide about how seriously to treat Cohen's and Trump's claims about attorney-client privilege unless she knew what clients Cohen had been representing.\n\nAn attorney for Cohen, who had asked whether he could submit the name to the judge in a sealed envelope or to the \"special master,\" had no choice but to reveal it in open court. Cohen's attorney had previously identified two other clients: Trump and Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy. These men are involved in cases in which Cohen allegedly arranged payments to women to keep them quiet about alleged sexual encounters.\n\nCohen has acknowledged paying pornographic actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election for what her lawyer said was silence about her alleged liaison with Trump in 2006. Cohen also reportedly arranged a deal for Broidy in which model Shera Bechard was paid $1.6 million when she became pregnant after an affair.\n\nTrump denies any sexual relationship with Daniels. Broidy acknowledged the affair with Bechard and apologized to his family. There was no immediate indication as to whether Hannity might have been involved in such an arrangement. Hannity issued a statement on Monday afternoon that said his discussions with Cohen had never involved anyone else.\n\n\"Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,\" Hannity said. \"I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective. I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear, they never involved any matter between me and a third party.\"\n\nHannity said separately on Twitter that his discussions with Cohen \"dealt almost exclusively about real estate.\"\n\nHannity has been a vocal supporter of Trump and Cohen on his show and a critic of the FBI and Justice Department. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Hannity's show last week that the FBI raid on Cohen was like the abuses of the \"Gestapo.\"\n\nAfter a long hearing on Monday, Wood said she had concluded the hearing without deciding whether to appoint the \"special master\" sought by Cohen or to permit the Justice Department's \"filter team\" to continue its work. While federal investigators will retain possession of what was seized, they still cannot look at the substance yet even as they are cataloging the amount of papers, electronic files, and other materials.",
    " Title: Americans' Dissatisfaction with Obama's Handling of ISIS and National Security, According to New CNN/ORC Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - A new CNN/ORC poll released Monday indicates that Americans are increasingly displeased with President Barack Obama's handling of ISIS, and a growing number of the nation believes that the fight against the terrorist organization is going poorly.\n\nThe poll shows that 57% disapprove of Obama's handling of foreign affairs overall, and 54% disapprove of his handling of terrorism. Additionally, 60% rate Obama negatively on his handling of electronic national security.\n\nThe declining approval ratings for Obama on national security come as a weekend of international turmoil further underscores the growing threats abroad. Egypt launched a second round of airstrikes against Islamic State strongholds in Libya on Monday, in response to a video released Sunday that appeared to show ISIS militants beheading a group of 21 Egyptian Christians.\n\nObama issued a statement condemning the killing of the Christians on Sunday night, but his Republican opponents have consistently argued that the growing ISIS threat is exacerbated by what they see as his weak leadership.\n\nIn the poll, Americans increasingly believe that U.S. military action against ISIS is going badly, with 58% saying so in the latest survey, up from 49% who said the fight was not going well in October. Even among Democrats, nearly half\u201446%\u2014say things are not going well in the battle against ISIS.\n\nAbout half of respondents, 51%, say they trust the President as Commander-in-Chief of the military. However, with ISIS affiliates continuing to commit brutal, gruesome murders and multiple terrorist attacks abroad grabbing international headlines over the past few months, support for sending ground troops to Iraq and Syria to confront the threat appears to be growing.\n\nThe survey suggests that Americans are warming up to the idea of sending ground troops to combat the terrorist organization. In November, just 43% supported deploying ground troops, while 55% of Americans opposed it; now the number in support has ticked up to 47%, the highest level of support yet measured, with just half of Americans opposed.\n\nThe parties have become more polarized on the prospect since November, with 61% of Democrats opposed and a similar majority of Republicans supportive of the prospect, an eight-point increase. Independents, meanwhile, are split, with 48% in favor and 50% opposed.\n\nThe prospect of sending in ground troops remains a sticking point for both congressional Democrats and Republicans in the debate over Obama's Authorization for the Use of Military Force, which would give him legal authority to combat ISIS. But the AUMF, and Obama's decision to go to Congress for the official authority to continue battling ISIS, is widely popular, according to the new poll.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of Americans say Congress should give Obama the authority to fight ISIS, a slight decline from 82% who supported it in December. A similarly large majority say Obama was right to ask Congress for the authority, rather than proceeding with the battle unilaterally.\n\nThe survey was conducted among 1,027 adult Americans from Feb. 12-15, and has a margin of sampling error of 3%.",
    " Title: White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's Assertions Prove False in Quick Succession\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early days of the Trump administration, Press Secretary Sean Spicer found himself in a series of missteps that led to the revelation of false assertions made during his press briefings.\n\nDuring his inaugural briefing on the first official workday of President Donald Trump's term, Spicer's statement about the size of the inaugural crowd was met with skepticism and ridicule. This was followed by his defense of National Security Advisor Mike Flynn's contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\n\nOn the issue of Flynn's contact with Kislyak, Spicer stated during a briefing on Monday that there had only been one call, and that it dealt with four subjects: a plane crash, Christmas, a conference about ISIS, and setting up a call between Trump and Vladimir Putin. However, three weeks later, it was reported that Flynn had allegedly discussed U.S.-imposed sanctions on Russia with Kislyak, and had misled the White House regarding the nature of their conversation. Flynn resigned on February 13.\n\nIn a further twist, it was revealed that Spicer's assertion that there had been no other conversations between Flynn and Kislyak was also false. The White House confirmed that Flynn had met with Kislyak alongside Jared Kushner, the president's senior adviser and son-in-law, in December. This meeting was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed by The Hive.\n\nThe White House has been grappling with questions about the meetings, discussions, and reasons for the frequent interactions between members of the Trump administration and Kislyak, particularly during the election season and the transition period. The lack of transparency and the subsequent revelation of false statements have raised questions about the administration's honesty and its dealings with Russia.\n\nAs the investigation into Russia's involvement in the 2016 election continues, it remains unclear who within the Trump administration was aware of these meetings and discussions, and why they chose to conceal this information from others, including Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Spicer, Trump, and Sessions have all stated that they were not aware of these meetings. The unfolding events have cast a shadow of doubt over the Trump administration's dealings with Russia and its commitment to transparency.",
    " Title: Army Regulations Determine Fate of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl as Active Duty Commitment Ends\n\nArticle:\n\nThe fate of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked off his base in Afghanistan in 2009 and was held captive by the Taliban until last May, hangs in the balance as he approaches the end of his active duty commitment. According to military law expert Charles Gittins, the Army must either court-martial him or give him an honorable discharge, as he has completed his service.\n\nUnder Army regulations, service members who are still serving their enlistment commitment are treated differently than those, like Sgt. Bergdahl, who have completed their active duty service. An active duty soldier whom the Army wishes to discharge can be sent to an administrative board. However, Sgt. Bergdahl, who is awaiting an Army decision on whether he will face criminal charges, is not in this category.\n\nIf the Army wishes to seek an other-than-honorable discharge, it would have to pursue criminal charges. In such a case, the soldier could negotiate a less-than-honorable discharge in lieu of a trial, according to Mr. Gittins. A conviction at court-martial could result in a bad conduct or dishonorable discharge.\n\nMaj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, the officer tasked with investigating Sgt. Bergdahl's actions in Afghanistan, has completed his report and submitted it to the office of Army Secretary John McHugh. A source familiar with the probe stated that Sgt. Bergdahl has denied deserting and provided an explanation for his actions on June 30, 2009. Soldiers from Sgt. Bergdahl's unit have accused him of desertion.\n\nSgt. Bergdahl is currently at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, assigned to the company headquarters. He was interviewed last August by Gen. Dahl, with his attorney, Eugene Fidell, present. Mr. Fidell, a military law expert and Yale Law School instructor, praised Gen. Dahl's professionalism and expressed hope for his future career.\n\nThe source familiar with the investigation did not know Gen. Dahl's conclusions, which have implications beyond Sgt. Bergdahl's fate. The investigation's outcome could fuel the ongoing debate about President Obama's decision to release five Taliban leaders in exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl's release and the subsequent criticism of the administration for not notifying Congress ahead of time, as required by law.\n\nThe White House's initial praise for Sgt. Bergdahl brought rebuttals from his battlemates, who portrayed him as a deserter who abandoned his unit and caused unnecessary missions to find him. The source familiar with the investigation revealed that Sgt. Bergdahl, while a captive, tried to escape and was abused. The Rolling Stone published emails from then-Private Bergdahl expressing disenchantment with his combat role in Afghanistan.\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) has accused the Pentagon of orchestrating a ransom payment for Sgt. Bergdahl, with the money allegedly paid to an \"Afghan intermediary.\" The Pentagon denies making a ransom payment, and Rep. Hunter has asked the Defense Department inspector general to investigate.\n\nThe Army is yet to make a decision on the next steps, with Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby stating that it is up to the Army to decide what the next steps are and that they will not rush the process. The Army is expected to make the investigation public at an appropriate time.",
    " Title: Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib's Criticism of Facial Recognition Technology and Workforce Diversity Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a visit to Detroit's \"Real-Time Crime\" center, which employs facial recognition technology, Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) expressed concerns about the racial makeup of the analysts working in the facility. Tlaib, a member of the progressive \"Squad,\" criticized the predominantly white workforce in a city that is 80 percent black, stating that analysts should be African American, not non-African American.\n\nDuring her tour of the facility, Tlaib expressed her belief that non-African Americans may struggle to identify African Americans and other people of color. She cited personal experiences and anecdotal evidence, such as misidentifying Congressmen Elijah Cummings and John Lewis, as examples. In response, Craig, the Detroit Police Chief, stated that the diverse group of crime analysts in the center was a slap in the face to all the men and women working there.\n\nTlaib's comments have sparked controversy, with critics labeling her remarks as reverse racism. In response to questions about whether non-whites should be barred from working as crime analysts in mostly white communities, Tlaib suggested looking up the issue, citing numerous studies, events, and anecdotal evidence that show facial recognition technology and white people often misidentify non-white faces.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that facial recognition technology is flawed due to its reliance on human programmers, who are predominantly white and male. For instance, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported in July that facial recognition algorithms misidentify black faces 5 to 10 times more often than white faces. Researchers at MIT have also noted that the technology is flawed because it learns from human programmers, who are almost all white and male.\n\nTlaib's comments have been met with criticism from conservatives and the Detroit Police Chief, who have condemned her remarks as reverse racism. However, Tlaib has repeatedly invoked these scientific studies to support her position. Despite the controversy, the issue of workforce diversity and the potential biases in facial recognition technology remains a topic of ongoing debate.",
    " Title: Legal Challenges Mount Against Trump's National Emergency Declaration for Border Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to use emergency powers to secure funding for the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is facing legal challenges from several states and advocacy groups. California and New York have announced their intention to challenge the move, which they argue is a bypass of Congress and a gross abuse of power.\n\nBuilding the wall was a key campaign promise for President Trump. Democrats have criticized the move, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer vowing to contest it in Congress and the courts. On Friday, Mr. Trump signed an emergency declaration along with a spending bill aimed at preventing a repeat of the recent government shutdown.\n\nWithin hours of the declaration, the first legal challenge against the national emergency was launched by the liberal advocacy group Public Citizen, on behalf of a nature reserve and three Texas landowners who have been told the wall may be constructed on their properties. Governor Gavin Newsom of California dismissed the president's decision as \"political theatre.\"\n\nNew York state's Democratic attorney general, Letitia James, said the state would not \"stand for this abuse of power and will fight back with every legal tool at our disposal.\" The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) also announced plans to file a lawsuit in the coming days to curb \"this blatantly illegal executive action.\"\n\nThe trouble with going nuclear, as some analysts suggest, is that it creates fallout. This has been presented as a predictably partisan issue, with Republicans on one side and Democrats on the other. However, the president's move has made it more complicated than that, with a number of Republican senators expressing unease about the president invoking a national emergency.\n\nThe National Emergencies Act contains a clause that allows Congress to terminate the emergency status if both houses vote for it and the president does not veto. With a comfortable majority in the House, Democrats could pass such a resolution to the Senate. The Republicans control the Senate, but a number of Republican senators have been vocal in their unease about the president's move.\n\nThe resolution would still require Mr. Trump's signature to pass, allowing him to veto it. A supermajority in both houses of Congress is needed to overturn a presidential veto. The National Emergencies Act is intended for times of national crisis, and Mr. Trump has claimed that there is a migration crisis at the nation's southern border - a claim strongly refuted by migration experts.\n\nDeclaring a national emergency would give the president access to special powers that effectively allow him to bypass the usual political process, and he would be able to divert money from existing military or disaster relief budgets to pay for the wall. Emergency declarations by previous presidents have been overwhelmingly used for addressing foreign policy crises.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told reporters that Mr. Trump's move \"creates zero precedent.\" He added, \"This is authority given to the president in law already. It's not as if he just didn't get what he wanted so he's waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.\"\n\nThe $8 billion for the wall would be made up of funds from the Department of Defense, with the largest amount coming from the military construction budget. This is almost certain to bring a legal challenge, as projects that could be cancelled include constructions at Guantanamo Bay, a military school in Japan, and special forces facilities in North Carolina.\n\nPoor living conditions for military families have become a concern, but a Pentagon spokesman, Bill Speaks, insisted \"military family-housing projects will not be affected.\" Trump officials also said that projects affecting force-readiness would not be compromised. Mr. Trump said military officials had told him the wall was more important, and that what he was told would be cut \"didn't sound too important to me.\"",
    " Title: Over 50 Pakistani Journalists Test Positive for Coronavirus as Country Eases Lockdown Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nIslamabad, Pakistan - A total of 54 journalists and media workers have tested positive for the coronavirus across Pakistan, according to data released by the Freedom Network rights group on Monday. This marks a significant increase in infections within the journalism community, highlighting the need for stricter adherence to safety guidelines as the South Asian nation continues to ease its lockdown amid a spike in cases and deaths.\n\nOne of the first journalists to test positive for the virus in the country was Salman Ashraf, a reporter for local television station Geo News in the southwest city of Quetta. Ashraf, who was one of seven people to test positive for the coronavirus in his organisation's Quetta bureau, shared his experience, stating, \"I was in the office and my body felt like I had a fever, and I felt really dizzy. I left the office before my shift ended. When I returned home, it was very difficult. I had a high fever, and a lot of body pain. I could not stand up.\"\n\nThe data shows a similar pattern of clusters of coronavirus cases in newsrooms and bureaus across the country, where journalists, technical staff, and media assistants often work in close proximity to each other. The number of infections in Pakistan began spiking last week, with several consecutive days of record increases in new infections and deaths. On Sunday, reported infections rose by a further 1,476 to 30,941, with at least 667 deaths and 8,212 patients having recovered.\n\nAs the country implements a government-mandated easing of lockdown measures, provinces have begun allowing smaller markets and several industries to reopen for up to five days a week, operating from sunrise until 5 pm each day. Prime Minister Imran Khan's government has insisted that a full lockdown is not economically sustainable for a country that was already in the midst of an economic crisis when its outbreak began in late February.\n\nLast month, the International Monetary Fund estimated that Pakistan's economy would contract by 1.5 percent owing to the coronavirus-related lockdowns, close to the worst such figures since the country gained independence in 1947. Khan has insisted that industries be required to follow government-mandated standard operating procedures to keep workers safe, or face being closed down again.\n\nFor journalists working across the country, individual news organisations have issued guidelines regarding social distancing and protective equipment while reporting. However, implementation on the ground has been inconsistent, with many journalists disregarding or ignoring the guidelines.\n\n\"We are going into the field in the same way,\" said one journalist in Quetta, speaking on condition of anonymity fearing reprisals from his employer. \"We are working in the same way, in the field and in the office. We are contacting the public in the same way.\"\n\nCompetition in Pakistan's news media landscape is cut-throat, with more than 30 24-hour television news channels competing with each other for ratings, in addition to dozens of national and regional newspapers.\n\n\"The general behavior that we are seeing, I am mentally prepared that I am going to get the virus. And I do not feel like I can save myself from this,\" said Syed Shahzad Kazmi, a cameraman for the local Roze News television station in the northwestern city of Peshawar. \"They are not taking it as seriously as it should be.\"\n\nKazmi, who tested positive for the coronavirus late last month, spent two weeks in quarantine at home before being certified as having recovered by health authorities. Asad Ali, a cameraman for the Gourmet News Network in Peshawar, tested positive for the coronavirus after being infected by a co-worker at his organisation's bureau. After spending two weeks in quarantine, he said he was back at work on the night shift, working as normal.\n\nIqbal Khattak, representative for the global media rights group Reporters Without Borders in Pakistan, stated, \"The protocol is quite good, but still, I think the protocol needs some [additional] steps.\" RSF's recommendations to Pakistani news organisations include no longer requiring television reporters to report live from places with large crowds, restricting coverage of press conferences where large numbers may gather, and avoiding commissioning reports from hospitals.\n\n\"I was just watching the 3 pm bulletin... and these journalists were all on the streets, close to the public,\" said Khattak. \"This is a worrying sign. [...] Getting live hits from the field is a risk that they are taking, and I think media houses should avoid taking these risks.\"",
    " Title: Retired General John Allen Tapped to Lead International Coalition Against ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that marks a return to a challenging and complex mission, retired four-star Marine General John Allen has been appointed to coordinate the international coalition against the Islamic State (ISIS), Secretary of State John Kerry announced on Friday. The appointment comes as President Barack Obama has vowed to destroy the militant organization that has taken control of portions of both Syria and Iraq.\n\nAllen, a veteran of many of the Middle East's most challenging conflicts, is well-acquainted with the difficult terrain he is about to enter. He was one of the top commanders in western Iraq during the \"Sunni Awakening,\" a program that worked to turn Sunni tribes in Anbar province against the al Qaeda affiliate operating in Iraq at the time. The militant organization now known as ISIS is the successor to that al Qaeda group.\n\nAllen, who graduated with honors from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1976, has a long and distinguished list of accomplishments. He took command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan in 2011, after General David Petraeus, then the coalition's commander, was nominated to become director of the CIA. Allen was the first Marine to head up the military effort in Afghanistan.\n\nBefore his command in Afghanistan, Allen was deputy commander at U.S. Central Command, which oversees all military operations in the Middle East. He is also a decorated veteran of the armed forces, having received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal and the Defense Superior Service Medal among others.\n\nAllen was briefly caught up in the 2012 scandal involving Petraeus' infidelity that led to the retired general's resignation from his CIA post. An investigation into \"flirtatious\" email exchanges between Allen and Jill Kelley, the Florida woman whose complaints about threatening emails from Petraeus' mistress, Paula Broadwell, brought the scandal into the public, led Allen to withdraw his nomination by Obama to become NATO's supreme allied commander in 2013. The Defense Department eventually cleared him of any wrongdoing, and Allen retired from the Marines.\n\nAllen is the married father of two daughters and holds master's degrees from Georgetown University, the Defense Intelligence College, and the National War College.",
    " Title: U.S. Defense Workers Return to Duty as Shutdown Enters Second Week\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second week of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is mirroring the events of the previous week, with no significant progress in negotiations between the political parties. However, one notable development is the return to work of U.S. civilian defense workers.\n\nAs reported by NPR's Bill Chappell, the Department of Defense has ordered most of its furloughed civilian employees, approximately 400,000 workers, to return to work starting Monday. This decision was announced by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel over the weekend and is based on the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" a legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Obama last week.\n\nHagel clarified that the law does not allow for a blanket recall of all civilians, but it can be used to bring back workers who support service personnel. The move is aimed at ensuring the smooth operation of military operations and the well-being of service members.\n\nThe shutdown has been marked by a series of partisan exchanges, with more than a dozen lawmakers appearing on Sunday shows to present their perspectives on the ongoing stalemate. The longer the standoff persists, the closer it comes to the October 17 deadline for raising the debt ceiling, setting the stage for a potential showdown on fiscal policy in the coming weeks.\n\nIn a critical assessment, The Washington Post noted that no party in Washington, including President Obama, House Republicans, and Senate Democrats, is emerging unscathed from the shutdown. However, the Post also points out that Republican governors with White House aspirations seem to be faring better than their counterparts in Congress.\n\nAccording to the Post, governors such as Bobby Jindal and Chris Christie are benefiting from the shutdown, with the chaos and name-calling in Washington serving as evidence that a problem-solver from outside the political establishment is needed. The shutdown, along with the partisan bickering, is seen as a testament to the broken nature of Washington politics.",
    " Title: President Obama's Shift in Perspective: A Look at His Changing Views on Construction Jobs and the Keystone XL Pipeline\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to his previous stance, President Barack Obama has expressed skepticism towards the creation of blue-collar jobs associated with the Keystone XL oil pipeline. During a speech in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Tuesday, the President chuckled derisively when discussing the pipeline project's potential to generate thousands of jobs over two years.\n\n\"They keep on talking about this\u2014an oil pipeline coming down from Canada that\u2019s estimated to create about 50 permanent jobs,\" Mr. Obama said. \"That\u2019s not a jobs plan.\"\n\nIn a recent interview, the President estimated that the pipeline project would create \"maybe 2,000\" construction jobs, referring to these jobs as \"a blip\" in comparison to the nation's employment needs. This contrasts sharply with Mr. Obama's attitude during his first term, when he expressed enthusiasm for construction jobs and called for more temporary stimulus spending on infrastructure projects to aid unemployed construction workers.\n\nIn 2011, as part of his \"We Can\u2019t Wait\" campaign, Mr. Obama held an event at the Key Bridge in Georgetown to urge Congress to approve more temporary stimulus spending on infrastructure projects. At the time, he emphasized the importance of construction jobs in the economic recovery.\n\n\"Of all the industries hammered by the economic downturn, construction has been among the hardest hit,\" Mr. Obama said. \"I\u2019m joining many of these workers to say that it makes absolutely no sense when there\u2019s so much work to be done that they\u2019re not doing the work.\"\n\nIn February 2009, Mr. Obama urged Congress to approve an $800 billion-plus economic stimulus package, citing the need for construction jobs. He argued that the stimulus legislation would create 3 to 4 million jobs and lay the groundwork for long-term growth by repairing infrastructure and moving the country toward energy independence.\n\nEven before taking office in January 2009, Mr. Obama was promoting government-funded infrastructure projects, many of which would have been temporary jobs given the act's proposed life of two or three years. Two years later, amid criticism that the stimulus law hadn't produced the promised number of construction jobs, Mr. Obama joked, \"Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected.\"\n\nThe President's top aides have defended his recent comments, stating that he was not disparaging the value of construction jobs but rather highlighting the lack of a comprehensive jobs strategy from House Republicans. Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to Mr. Obama, told reporters that the President's latest comments are \"not inconsistent\" with previous statements about construction jobs.\n\n\"One infrastructure project is not a jobs strategy,\" Mr. Pfeiffer said. \"That would be like saying our jobs strategy is to repair the Key Bridge. We\u2019re talking about one thing, and it would have some temporary jobs which would be significant. But in the overall scale of the employment situation in this country, as the president said, it\u2019s a blip.\"\n\nMr. Pfeiffer suggested that the President's comments about Keystone are aimed at September confrontations with Republicans over spending and borrowing.\n\n\"He\u2019s put his jobs ideas on the table, he\u2019s calling on Republicans to do the same,\" Mr. Pfeiffer said. \"To date, the core of the Republican jobs package\u2026 is vote to repeal Obamacare for the 40th time and build the Keystone pipeline. There\u2019s a legitimate debate over whether you should build that pipeline or not. The president\u2019s point is that\u2019s not a jobs strategy.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers have criticized the President's job estimates for the project, with House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton stating, \"The president famously pledged to \u2018do whatever it takes\u2019 to create jobs\u2014but this is a new low.\"\n\nThe State Department has estimated that the pipeline project would create 5,000 to 6,000 construction jobs per year, with TransCanada Corp., the pipeline builder, estimating about 13,000 jobs over two years. The State Department also said the project could support another 42,000 jobs per year for two years across the U.S. in related industries.",
    " Title: Trump Endorses Paul Ryan, Shocks Grassroots Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump endorsed House Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Friday, marking an end to his days-long hesitation to back the party's most influential leader.\n\n\"In our shared mission to make America great again, I support and endorse our speaker of the House, Paul Ryan,\" Mr. Trump said at a campaign rally in Mr. Ryan's home state of Wisconsin.\n\nThe endorsement signaled a readiness from the New York billionaire to work with the Republican Party establishment that had initially opposed his candidacy. However, it also sparked outrage among grass-roots conservatives who wanted Mr. Trump to challenge establishment figures like Mr. Ryan, viewed as fake conservatives or RINOs, the derogatory acronym for those deemed to be Republicans in name only.\n\nMr. Trump had previously withheld his endorsement in Mr. Ryan's primary race against an anti-establishment rival, Paul Nehlen, a strong Trump supporter. In recent days, Mr. Trump had stated that he \"wasn't there yet\" in backing Mr. Ryan, echoing the speaker's earlier comments when he resisted endorsing Mr. Trump.\n\nAt the rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Mr. Trump referenced Ronald Reagan's tenet, stating, \"We may disagree on a couple of things, but mostly we agree. And we're going to get it done, and we're going to do a lot of wonderful things.\"\n\nIn addition to endorsing Mr. Ryan, Mr. Trump also announced endorsements for two Senate Republican incumbents in tight races who had been tentative in their support for him: Arizona Sen. John McCain and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte.\n\nThe trio of endorsements, particularly the one for Mr. Ryan, caught some of Mr. Trump's diehard supporters off guard.\n\n\"He has broken our heart doing this tonight,\" said Trump supporter Sue Payne, a conservative activist working to defeat Mr. Ryan. \"We finally thought we had a voice to stand up against the RINO establishment. He sold us out.\"\n\n\"What happened tonight is the establishment got their claws in him and they are pulling the strings. What do we believe now?\" she added.\n\nMr. Nehlen, who faced an uphill battle in taking on the powerful House speaker, understood Mr. Trump's decision to back the party leadership.\n\n\"Given his stature as our party's official nominee, Mr. Trump's decision to support the Republican Speaker is appropriate and is a display of true leadership,\" Mr. Nehlen said in a statement.\n\n\"Mr. Trump's early refusal to endorse Ryan sent a clear signal to Wisconsin voters that Ryan is not his preferred candidate in this race. Speaker Ryan's globalist agenda stands in clear opposition to the will of the Republican electorate, who want safe communities, immigration control, smart trade deals, and leaders who put the needs of the American people first,\" he added.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Rule to Limit Food Stamp Benefits, Sparking Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a move that has sparked controversy, the Trump administration has proposed a rule that could potentially affect as many as 3.1 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The proposed rule, unveiled Tuesday, aims to eliminate what the administration deems as \"loopholes\" and save taxpayer funds.\n\nUnder the proposed rule, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) SNAP would no longer provide benefits to families solely because they are enrolled in food assistance programs run by the states where they reside. This change is intended to address a situation where some states have expanded eligibility to recipients who would not otherwise qualify for the federal program based on asset or income limitations.\n\nUSDA officials argue that the proposed rule would \"fix a loophole\" that has allowed households to receive assistance \"when they clearly don\u2019t need it.\" The agency claims the proposal could save billions in taxpayer funds. Recipients who lose their benefits could reapply and qualify if they meet the federal standards for assistance.\n\nCritics, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), have denounced the proposal, with Pelosi calling it an \"act of staggering callousness.\" Anti-poverty advocates argue that the rule will make working Americans hungrier and make it harder for families to work their way out of poverty.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue defended the proposal, stating, \"The American people expect their government to be fair, efficient, and to have integrity \u2013 just as they do in their own homes, businesses, and communities.\"\n\nThe proposed rule comes after the administration's December proposal to tighten work requirements for SNAP recipients. This previous proposal would restrict states from exempting work-eligible adults from receiving food stamps if they are not seeking employment.\n\nIn response to the latest proposal, Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) criticized the move as a hypocritical dictate from a party that often preaches states' rights. \"When it comes to putting that rhetoric into practice for SNAP, they take the opposite position,\" she said.\n\nThe debate over the food stamp program, often considered an example of government waste by conservatives, continues to be a contentious issue in Washington. In December, Congress rejected Republican-sponsored changes to SNAP as part of a $400 billion farm bill.",

The incident occurred during a closed-door hearing with Laura Cooper, the U.S. defense official who oversees Ukraine and Russia matters.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, which focuses on President Donald Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, was the center of the confrontation. In a highly charged atmosphere, Republican lawmakers stormed into a hearing room where Cooper was due to testify, causing a commotion and prompting the intervention of Capitol police.\n\nRepublican Representative Ted Lieu described the situation, stating, \"They're freaked out. They're trying to stop this investigation. They don't want to hear from witness Cooper today. They know more facts are going to be delivered which are absolutely damning to the president of the United States.\"\n\nRepublican Representative Mark Meadows explained the lawmakers' actions, saying, \"There's about 20 members (lawmakers) down there, at least a dozen that are not on the three committees. And they're going to wait until there's a more open and transparent process.\"\n\nThe Republicans' actions have been met with criticism from Democrats, who view it as an attempt to obstruct the impeachment inquiry and intimidate witnesses. Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell stated, \"We see this as an effort not only to intimidate this witness but also to intimidate future witnesses from coming forward. It's not going to work. We're not going to be deterred.\"\n\nThe impeachment inquiry could lead to the House passing formal charges, known as articles of impeachment, prompting a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate on whether to remove Trump from office. However, Senate Republicans have shown little appetite for removing Trump.\n\nThis is not the first time Republicans have criticized the impeachment process, with some calling it a \"joke,\" a \"railroad job,\" a \"charade,\" and \"Soviet-style.\" The inquiry, triggered by a whistleblower complaint against Trump, has seen several key witnesses testify, including William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, who testified that Trump had made the aid contingent on Ukraine announcing investigations into Biden and his son Hunter Biden's tenure on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nCooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, did not testify on Wednesday, and the day's impeachment-related proceedings were suspended. As the impeachment inquiry continues, the focus remains on the allegations against President Trump and the actions of the U.S. Congress in addressing them.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Calls for Unprecedented Measures to Address COVID-19 Crisis, Emphasizes Long-term Policy Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of the unprecedented medical and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has called for immediate and far-reaching measures to protect all Americans. Sanders emphasized the need for a response that is guided by medical professionals, not politicians, and for long-term policy changes to ensure the country is better prepared for future emergencies.\n\nSanders, in a commentary published by CNN, stated, \"Our response must meet the enormous scale of the pandemic.\" He called for increased availability of coronavirus test kits, accelerated processing of tests, and the building out of more intensive care units and obtaining additional ventilators. Sanders also emphasized the importance of collaboration with other countries to learn about the novel coronavirus.\n\nIn the short term, Sanders believes that the response must prioritize the health and safety of all people, regardless of their income. He stated, \"In the short term, we must respond with unprecedented measures to make sure we protect all people regardless of their income.\"\n\nHowever, Sanders also called for long-term policy changes, particularly in the areas of healthcare and paid family and medical leave. He argued that the current healthcare system in the U.S. is inadequate, with many Americans uninsured or underinsured, and that the pandemic has put a spotlight on the shortcomings of the current system. Sanders called for a guarantee of healthcare as a human right, not a privilege.\n\nSanders also highlighted the need for paid family and medical leave, stating that many workers may be going to work while sick due to financial constraints. He called for the U.S. to join other major countries in guaranteeing paid family and medical leave to all workers.\n\nSanders also criticized globalization and disastrous trade policies, stating that they have outsourced jobs and factories overseas, leaving the U.S. dependent on other countries for essential goods during a national crisis. He called for fair trade policies that bring production and manufacturing back to the U.S.\n\nSanders concluded by stating, \"That is what our presidential campaign has been all about \u2014 and that is what our whole country must be about in the months ahead.\" The days ahead will be difficult and challenging, but Sanders emphasized the need for urgent short-term measures and long-term policy changes to fundamentally transform the country for the better.",
    " Title: Democrats Secure Virginia Governor's Seat, Boosting National Morale Amidst Trump Era\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Democrat Ralph Northam clinched a hard-fought victory in the Virginia gubernatorial race on Tuesday, marking a setback for President Donald Trump as Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a contest that saw a series of contentious exchanges on divisive issues.\n\nNortham, the state's lieutenant governor, managed to withstand a barrage of attack ads from Gillespie, who targeted the soft-spoken Democrat on issues such as immigration, gang crime, and Confederate statues. Trump, who endorsed Gillespie but did not campaign with him, had sent tweets and recorded messages in support of the former Republican National Committee chairman on Tuesday. However, after the election results, Trump quickly distanced himself from Gillespie.\n\n\"Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,\" Trump tweeted. \"With the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!\"\n\nAt his victory party, Northam told supporters that the Democratic sweep in Virginia sent a message to the nation.\n\n\"Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we will not condone hatred and bigotry, and to end the politics that have torn this country apart,\" Northam said.\n\nThe Virginia race was part of a series of state and local elections that also included a governor's race in New Jersey, where Democrat Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and ambassador to Germany, defeated Republican Kim Guadagno for the right to succeed Republican Chris Christie. Murphy had pledged to serve as a check on Trump in Democratic-leaning New Jersey. Guadagno, the lieutenant governor, was hindered by her association with the unpopular Christie.\n\nMurphy's win, along with Northam's victory in Virginia, a state that Clinton won by 5 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election, provided a much-needed boost for national Democrats who were eager to translate grassroots resistance to Trump into election victories. Democrats had already lost four special congressional elections earlier this year.\n\nA strong turnout in the Democratic-leaning northern Virginia suburbs of Washington helped propel Northam, who, in the end, won relatively easily. With nearly all precincts reporting, he led by a 53 percent to 45 percent margin.\n\nExit polls in Virginia showed that one-third of the voters went to the polls to oppose Trump, and only 17 percent went to support him. Democrats also swept the other top statewide Virginia races, winning the offices of lieutenant governor and attorney general, and gaining seats in the Virginia House of Delegates. Democrat Danica Roem became the first transgender person to win a state legislative race.\n\n\"This is a comprehensive political victory from statehouse to courthouse. Thank you, Donald Trump!\" Democratic U.S. Representative Gerald Connolly of Virginia told Northam's supporters at a victory party in northern Virginia.\n\nIn Virginia, Democrats had feared that a Gillespie win would embolden Republicans to emphasize divisive cultural issues in their campaigns for next year's elections, when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 of the U.S. Senate's 100 seats come up for election. Republicans now control both chambers.\n\nGillespie, speaking to crestfallen supporters in Richmond, Virginia, said he had run a \"very policy-focused campaign.\" However, voters in Arlington County - a suburban Democratic stronghold bordering Washington - said national politics were important to their votes.\n\n\"Trump talks about draining the swamp, but Gillespie kind of is the swamp,\" said Nick Peacemaker, who works in marketing and considered himself a Republican until Trump won the party's presidential nomination. Peacemaker said Gillespie seemed to shift closer to Trump's policies after securing the Republican gubernatorial nomination.\n\nIn local races across the country, Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio in New York and Marty Walsh in Boston both easily won re-election. Voters were also picking mayors in Detroit, Atlanta, Seattle, and Charlotte, North Carolina.",
    " Title: U.S. Restores Sanctions on Iran, Exempts Eight Countries for Oil Imports\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday reinstated U.S. sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, but granted exemptions for eight countries that can continue to import oil from the Islamic Republic without penalty. The sanctions, which take effect on Monday, cover Iran's shipping, financial, and energy sectors, marking the second batch of sanctions re-imposed since President Trump withdrew from the landmark accord in May.\n\nThe 2015 deal, one of former President Obama's biggest diplomatic achievements, provided Iran with billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, which many believed was being used to develop atomic weapons. President Trump repeatedly denounced the agreement as the \"worst ever\" negotiated by the United States and argued it gave Iran too much in return for too little.\n\nProponents, as well as the other parties to the deal\u2014Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, and the European Union\u2014have vigorously defended it. The Europeans have launched a drive to save the agreement without the U.S., fearing that the new sanctions will drive Iran to pull out and resume all of its nuclear work.\n\nThe new measures are expected to impact Iranians significantly. In Tehran, one man said the harder the U.S. pushes, the more people will resist. In a wealthier area, \u2588\u2588\u2588 met the Hossein family. \"I want to escape from Iran,\" said Essam, an accountant, who is disillusioned with both the U.S. and Iranian governments.\n\nFriday's announcement came just days before the U.S. congressional midterm elections, allowing President Trump to highlight his decision to withdraw from the deal\u2014a move that was popular among Republicans. Shortly after the announcement, President Trump tweeted an image of himself that resembles the TV series \"Game of Thrones\" with the tagline \"Sanctions are Coming, November 5.\"\n\n\"Our objective is to force the regime into a clear choice: either abandon its destructive behavior or continue down the path toward economic disaster,\" President Trump said in a statement issued Friday night. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions are \"aimed at fundamentally altering the behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\"\n\nPompeo has issued a list of 12 demands that Iran must meet to have the sanctions lifted, including an end to its support for terrorism and military engagement in Syria and a halt to nuclear and ballistic missile development. Pompeo said eight nations will receive temporary waivers allowing them to continue to import Iranian petroleum products as they phase out such imports entirely. He said these countries, which include U.S. allies such as Turkey, Italy, India, Japan, and South Korea, had made efforts to eliminate their imports but could not complete the task by Monday.\n\nThe waivers will be valid for six months, during which time the importing country can buy Iranian oil but must deposit Iran's revenue in an escrow account. Iran can spend the money but only on a narrow range of humanitarian items.\n\nPompeo defended the oil waivers and noted that since May, when the U.S. began to pressure countries to stop buying Iranian oil, Iran's exports had dropped by more than 1 million barrels per day. He said the Iranian economy is already reeling from the earlier sanctions, with the currency losing half its value since April. The government has ensured basic services like trash collection are working normally, and it's kept gas prices low at about 90 cents a gallon. However, prices in general have skyrocketed, according to \u2588\u2588\u2588's Palmer. That's for \"cheese, for butter, for jam, for meat, for chicken, everything,\" said Reza Eidiyuon, who, like everybody else in Tehran, is worried about the new U.S. sanctions.\n\nSome Iran hawks in Congress and elsewhere said Friday's move should have gone even further. They were hoping for Iran to be disconnected from the main international financial messaging network known as SWIFT.\n\nWith limited exceptions, the re-imposed U.S. sanctions will affect Iran as well as countries that do not stop importing Iranian oil and foreign firms that do business with blacklisted Iranian entities, including its central bank, a number of private financial institutions, and state-run port and shipping firms, as well as hundreds of individual Iranian officials.\n\n\"Our ultimate aim is to compel Iran to permanently abandon its well-documented outlaw activities and behave as a normal country,\" Pompeo told reporters in a conference call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin said 700 more Iranian companies and people would be added to the sanctions rolls. Those, he said, would include more than 300 that had not been included under previous sanctions.\n\nOn Saturday, the eve of the anniversary of the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran's Supreme Leader said the Islamic Republic is the \"victorious party\" after nearly 40 years of confrontation by the United States. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that despite military, economic, and propaganda wars waged by the U.S. against Iran over the last four decades, \"the U.S. is the defeated side and the Islamic Republic is the victorious party.\"\n\nKhamenei said the U.S. has failed to dominate Iran in the way it did before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted a pro-Western monarchy. He said the U.S. is weaker than it was in 1979.",
    " Title: Weinstein Company Requests Removal of Controversial Interviews from 'Fed Up' Documentary on YouTube, Counter-Notification Filed\n\nThe Weinstein Company, the distributor of the 2014 documentary 'Fed Up,' has requested that two interviews at the center of allegations of deceptive editing be removed from YouTube. The takedown request, listed as \"manually detected\" in YouTube's documentation, was made by the Weinstein Company.\n\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 has since initiated a counter-notification, requesting that the videos be reinstated on fair use grounds as they are the subject of a news report. The Free Beacon has moved the videos to another video platform and reinserted them into the original story while the dispute is settled by YouTube.\n\nThe videos in question feature two interviews from 'Fed Up' where the producers are accused of unethical editing techniques. In one of the videos, Dr. David Allison is shown stumbling during an answer and then pausing for several seconds before the film cuts to another interview, with an answer to the question he was asked never shown. Dr. Allison stated that he did provide an answer to the question and that Katie Couric, the film's producer and narrator, assured him he could pause to rework answers if needed.\n\n\"What she did to me is antithetical to not only just human decency and civility but it is antithetical to the spirit of science and democratic dialogue,\" Dr. Allison told the Free Beacon.\n\nThe other video features an interview with former Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation spokesperson Lisa Gable. Industry sources claim the audio of the off-camera interview was manipulated to embarrass Gable. An audio clip of the off-camera interviewer saying she did not believe Gable was answering her questions did not occur at the moment it is portrayed in the film, according to the sources. \"That response from the producer didn\u2019t actually follow that particular exchange and was edited to make it look like that was how their conversation actually went,\" one source said.\n\nThe Weinstein Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Revokes Obama-Era Transparency Rule on Drone Strike Civilian Deaths\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked criticism from lawmakers and human rights groups, President Donald Trump has revoked an executive order implemented by his predecessor, Barack Obama, requiring U.S. intelligence officials to disclose the number of civilians killed in drone strikes outside of war zones.\n\nThe 2016 executive order, which aimed to increase transparency, was a response to pressure on Obama to be more open about the use of drone strikes, a practice that has become increasingly common since the 9/11 terror attacks. The Trump administration has deemed the rule as \"superfluous\" and distracting.\n\nThe order applied to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which has carried out drone strikes in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Somalia. The revoked order required the head of the CIA to release annual summaries of U.S. drone strikes and assess how many civilians were killed as a result.\n\nSince Trump's presidency began in 2016, there have been 2,243 drone strikes, compared to 1,878 in Obama's eight years in office, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a UK-based think tank. During Obama's tenure, 1,878 drone strikes were carried out, according to researchers.\n\nCritics of the drone program under the Obama administration argued that the operations were overly secretive and failed to acknowledge instances of civilian casualties. In response, Obama stated that strikes were carried out in a precise manner, and intelligence officials would release data on civilians who were accidentally killed in strikes outside of war zones.\n\nPresident Trump has expanded upon the existing program, making it more ambitious. However, some operations outside of war zones have become more secretive under Trump's administration, leading to less transparency.\n\nLawmakers and rights groups have criticized Trump's decision, expressing concern that it could allow the CIA to conduct drone strikes without accountability. Rita Siemion of Human Rights First stated, \"The Trump administration's action is an unnecessary and dangerous step backwards on transparency and accountability for the use of lethal force, and the civilian casualties they cause.\"\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, a Democrat who chairs Congress's intelligence committee, called the requirement issued by Obama \"an important measure of transparency,\" and stated, \"there is simply no justification\" for cancelling it.",
    " Title: Nike's Controversial Decision to Feature Colin Kaepernick in \"Just Do It\" Campaign Escalates NFL Protest Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bold move that has further ignited the ongoing debate surrounding athlete activism and the NFL, Nike has chosen to make Colin Kaepernick the face of its 30th anniversary \"Just Do It\" campaign. The controversial quarterback, who is currently unemployed and taking legal action against the NFL, has become a polarizing figure in America due to his kneel-down protest against police brutality.\n\nThe announcement of the campaign has sparked a significant backlash, with Nike stock falling 3 percent, and other athletic shoe companies experiencing similar or greater dips. The hashtag #NikeBoycott trended on Twitter, and reports of Nike gear-burning and other protests have surfaced.\n\nThe NFL season is set to kick off this Thursday, and the partnership between Nike and the NFL, which runs through 2028, could potentially cause tension. Every NFL player wears a Nike-made uniform, and all sideline gear worn by players and coaches is likewise logoed. Any player or coach who wishes to protest the Kaepernick-Nike partnership might have to deface their own uniform.\n\nThe NFL player-protest issue is currently in limbo, with team owners voting in the offseason to punish players who protest on the field, but the rule is on hold pending negotiations with the players union. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has stated that any of his players who protest will be punished or banned. His team opens Sunday at Carolina.\n\nThe demonstrations are a pet cause of President Trump, who has openly urged owners to fire protesting players. Many NFL team owners are known to quake in fear at Trump's demands and threats. The protests had all but disappeared from everyone's radar until Trump revived the movement early last NFL season with insulting and demeaning tweets.\n\nLast week, Kaepernick's grievance against the NFL for colluding to deny him employment received a boost when an arbitrator denied the NFL's request for a dismissal. A portion of the money Nike pays the league for sponsorship could potentially wind up in Kaepernick's pocket.\n\nNike reportedly plans to sell Kaepernick shoes and sportswear, and to back up the initial \"Believe\" ad with billboards, TV commercials, and online ads. A billboard of the first Kaepernick ad went up near Niketown at Union Square on Tuesday.\n\nNike's corporate sincerity in backing Kaepernick's cause has been called into question. After all, the company plans to make money by selling Kaepernick gear. However, if Nike didn't have its heart and soul in this campaign, why would the company take the enormous and obvious risk in alienating millions of customers?\n\nThe NFL released a statement from Jocelyn Moore, the NFL's vice president of communications and public affairs, saying, \"The National Football League believes in dialogue, understanding, and unity. We embrace the role and responsibility of everyone involved with this game to promote meaningful, positive change in our communities. The social justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised deserve our attention and action.\"\n\nA recent NBC News and Wall Street Journal poll showed 54 percent of Americans feel the NFL protests are \"inappropriate,\" while 43 percent go with \"appropriate.\" Whatever profits Nike might make on Kaepernick gear would seem to be more than offset by the loss of revenue from protests of Nike.\n\nNike could have avoided the backlash by simply remaining out of the fray, or by quietly backing Kaepernick. This had to be a decision made at the Phil Knight level. Maybe Knight and his knights were heeding the words of Martin Luther King Jr.: \"There comes a time when silence is betrayal.\"\n\nThe NFL is now caught in a difficult position. If the owners follow the lead of Trump, Jones, and a majority (however narrow) of Americans, the league risks alienating about half its fans and maybe more than half its players. Almost all the protesting players are black, and 70 percent of the league's players are black. That's a powerful lobby.\n\nHowever, if the NFL caves to the players' union, and allows at least some protests, the league risks suffering boycotts of games and team and league sponsors. Other than the racial component of the debate, there are many shades of gray. Support for Kaepernick is problematical for those who can't forget or forgive him wearing cartoon-pig socks to protest police brutality.\n\nFor some, the new Nike campaign casts doubt on his rebel persona. \"Revolutionaries aren't sponsored by major corporations,\" said Fox Sports commentator Jason Whitlock. But if a revolution is being waged against forces backed by money and power, isn't money and power needed by the revolutionaries?\n\nAnd does anyone really believe Kaepernick willingly gave up a pro football career in order to cash in on his revolution by selling shoes? This is a man who, while unemployed, donated $1 million to hand-selected causes and who continues to lead educational camps for inner-city kids.\n\nIf that's all been a Kaepernick scheme to get rich selling shoes, it's certainly revolutionary.",
    " Title: Columbia University's cultureSHOCK Event: Comedian Nimesh Patel Removed for Controversial Performance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, comedian Nimesh Patel, a former Saturday Night Live writer, was removed from the stage during Columbia University's cultureSHOCK: Reclaim event. The annual charity showcase, which aims to promote Asian-American artistic expression and challenge harmful stereotypes, saw Patel's performance cut short due to jokes deemed homophobic and racist.\n\nAccording to the Columbia Daily Spectator, Patel's set included commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City, which included a joke about a gay black man in his neighborhood. This material was found inappropriate by the Columbia Asian American Alliance (AAA), the organizers of the event.\n\nDuring the performance, Patel made a remark about sexual orientation, stating, \"No one looks in the mirror and thinks, 'This black thing is too easy; let me just add another thing to it.'\" This comment, along with his remarks about racial identities, prompted members of AAA to interrupt the performance and denounce his material.\n\nAfter a few moments for closing remarks, Patel pushed back, asserting that none of his jokes were offensive. He claimed that he was merely exposing the audience to ideas that would be found \"in the real world.\" However, his microphone was cut from offstage, and he exited the event.\n\nIn a statement on Facebook, AAA defended its decision, stating, \"Patel's remarks ran counter to the inclusive spirit and integrity of cultureSHOCK, and as such, the choice was made to invite him to leave.\" The group added, \"We acknowledge that discomfort and safety can coexist, however, the discomfort Patel caused was unproductive in this space.\" AAA also expressed regret for inviting Patel in the first place.\n\nReactions from the audience were reportedly split on AAA's decision to remove Patel. As of now, Patel has yet to comment on the event. The 32-year-old comedian was the first Indian-American writer for SNL, but he left after last season. He has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing and has opened for comedians such as Chris Rock.",
    " Title: \"2020 Presidential Election: Trump Trailing in Polls, but Incumbency Advantage Remains a Factor\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest polls, President Donald Trump is trailing most Democratic candidates in the 2020 general election, even in traditionally Republican strongholds like Texas. While this may seem like a promising sign for Democratic voters, they should exercise caution in interpreting these results. The 2016 election demonstrated that polls taken 14 months before an election are not always predictive, and the race becomes more meaningful when a specific Democrat is pitted against a specific Republican.\n\nThe latest polling data from Texas, for instance, shows Trump polling behind not only Joe Biden but also Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. The numbers from Latino Decisions, North Star Opinion Research, and the University of Houston indicate that Trump's support ranges between 41% and 44% in the Lone Star State.\n\nSimilarly, a recent poll from the Washington Post and ABC News at the national level among registered voters shows Trump failing to breach 45% against any of his potential Democratic opponents.\n\nWhile it may be tempting to analyze the minor differences between the Democratic candidates in these polls, political analysts advise against over-interpreting these variations. The results, they argue, reveal more about Trump's vulnerability than they do about the relative strengths of the Democratic candidates.\n\n\"The results tell us a lot more about Trump's vulnerability than it shows the strength of the different Democratic candidates relative to each other,\" one pollster working with a 2020 campaign said.\n\nTrump has time to turn his position around, but he currently appears to be in a weaker position for re-election compared to the last two presidents who won second terms. A recent CNN poll shows that six in ten Americans believe Trump does not deserve a second term, a higher percentage than was reported for Obama or George W. Bush at the same stage of their presidencies.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's approval rating has consistently been unpopular throughout his first two years in office. According to the RealClearPolitics average of the president's approval rating, Trump has been 7 points more unpopular than popular, a stark contrast to the traditional driver of presidential approval, the economy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Democratic primary remains focused on the concept of electability, these polls suggest that Trump is in a weak position, and his path to victory becomes increasingly narrow if he fails to win over more voters. His low approval rating coupled with his poor showing in hypothetical head-to-head match-ups indicate that he may not be finding a winning strategy despite holding a winning hand.",
    " Title: Rep. Peter T. King Urges FBI to Focus on Muslim Community in Wake of Boston Marathon Bombings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings, Rep. Peter T. King, a leading GOP congressman and chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterintelligence and terrorism, has called for the FBI to focus their investigations on threats from within the Muslim community.\n\nDuring an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" King stated, \"If you know a threat is coming from a certain community, that's where you look.\" He emphasized that the strategy of terrorists has evolved since September 11, 2001, with groups like al Qaeda planning massive attacks from Middle Eastern training camps less frequently. Instead, they are using individuals, such as the two suspected Boston bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died during a shootout with police on Thursday night, and his brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was shot and remains in serious condition in a hospital. Both men were of Islamic faith.\n\nKing also criticized the FBI for failing to apprehend the two men before the bombings, which killed three and injured over 160 at the iconic Boston race on Monday. The FBI reportedly interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev but found no links to terrorism.\n\nIn response to King's comments, the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center issued a statement expressing their condolences and regret for the tragedy. They acknowledged that both suspects were known to their community, yet no one was able to predict the alleged suspects' actions. The statement read, \"This hurts, and we wish we all could have done something to prevent this.\"\n\nThe call for increased scrutiny of the Muslim community in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings has sparked controversy and debate, with many questioning the effectiveness and fairness of such an approach. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies continue to investigate the bombings and have not yet determined the motives behind the attack.",
    " Title: GSK Accelerates Production of Ebola Vaccine Amid Ongoing West African Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the drug company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has announced an unprecedented move to start mass production of a vaccine that is currently in the early stages of human testing. This decision comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it ethical to use unproven and experimental treatments in this public health emergency.\n\nThe push to discover Ebola therapies could potentially be a silver lining of the epidemic, as companies involved in Ebola drug development have pledged to bring their treatments to those in need if they prove effective. However, the road to market for new drugs is long, tedious, and fraught with failure.\n\nThe process of bringing a drug or vaccine to market in the United States typically involves three phases of clinical trials in humans. Before testing it on humans, researchers must first present promising data from animal studies to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and receive approval to recruit patients. This pre-clinical phase of drug development can take several years, and for every 5,000 compounds discovered at this stage, only about five are allowed to proceed to human trials.\n\nIf a drug moves forward, researchers must find hundreds and then thousands of volunteers to participate in clinical trials. In the first phase, they test the drug's safety on a small group of healthy individuals to ensure it doesn't cause immediate harm or worsen health conditions, and to determine the maximum tolerable dose.\n\nIn a larger group of participants, they test to ensure the treatment delivers on its promise and monitor its effectiveness against the best-available therapies or a placebo. The third phase involves an even larger group, up to 3,000 people, and researchers compare how the drug works against other treatments on the market and analyze safety data.\n\nThis entire drug development process takes an average of 12 years, and costs between $100 million and $1 billion. Only one in five therapies make it through this process, and it usually takes the FDA a couple of years to consider the data and bring the drug to market if it chooses to do so.\n\nGSK is already manufacturing an Ebola vaccine that has only promising animal studies behind it, but has not yet been fully tested in humans. The company has said it will have 10,000 doses stockpiled should the science for the vaccine prove out. However, the vaccine is only in phase one, a long way from the end of the development road.\n\nWhen asked about the timeline for bringing the Ebola vaccine to market, GSK representatives explained that the normal pathway for bringing a vaccine to market takes 10 years, and they are already three years into the process with the Ebola vaccine. While the crisis has focused attention on Ebola drug development and helped to galvanize resources, they were not yet clear on what would happen after a successful phase one trial and how much longer it would take to scale-up manufacturing and get the vaccine approved for use in people.\n\nThere is a chance that the usual process might be condensed or phases of clinical testing skipped, since Ebola is an unusually deadly pathogen and will be treated differently by regulators. However, even in dire situations, developing safe, new therapies takes time, and unfortunately, mostly ends in failure. We are only in phase one with the Ebola vaccine. If data look promising, hopefully, regulators will find ways to ensure it's not seven more years until we can prevent another Ebola epidemic.",
    " Title: Trump's Apology and Kavanaugh's Swearing-In: A Turning Point in American Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, President Donald Trump delivered a compassionate and apologetic speech at the swearing-in ceremony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court on Monday night. The president expressed remorse for the \"terrible pain and suffering\" Kavanaugh and his family endured during the contentious confirmation process, which he described as a violation of fairness and the presumption of innocence.\n\nTrump also addressed Kavanaugh's young daughters, praising their father as a \"great man, a man of decency, character, kindness, and courage.\" The event, which took place in front of a cheering White House audience, was a display of Republican solidarity, with Senators Mitch McConnell, Charles Grassley, Lindsey Graham, and Susan Collins in attendance.\n\nThe ceremony, however, was more than just a show of support. With the eight other Supreme Court justices present, Trump aimed to restore dignity to the judiciary, which has been tarnished by the mudslinging politics that characterized Kavanaugh's confirmation process. The president's concern that the character assassination attempt on Kavanaugh may be a seminal moment in American political and cultural history is well-founded.\n\nThe ideas that the court is just another political branch and that the presumption of innocence no longer applies if you are on the other team represent a seismic shift in how we view each other and the nation as a whole. If these ideas persist, we are in more trouble than we can imagine.\n\nWhile Trump has at times contributed to the political rancor, he was commendable in his efforts to repair the damage inflicted by Senate Democrats and their media allies during the confirmation process. Hillary Clinton, in an interview with CNN, suggested that civility can return when Democrats regain power. Her comments are as reckless as bringing a can of gasoline to a bonfire, stoking trouble to gain a foothold in the 2020 race.\n\nIn a separate event, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed legislation allowing a third gender option on city birth certificates. The change, which takes effect on January 1, removes the requirement for a medical or mental health professional's affirmation of an individual's gender to change the certificate. While the change may be significant for some, questions have been raised about its impact on society and the city's priorities.\n\nIn conclusion, the events of the past two days have highlighted the polarization in American politics and society. The Kavanaugh confirmation process has revealed the Republican Party's ability to fight back and win, while the third gender option on city birth certificates has sparked debate about societal norms and priorities. As citizens, it is crucial to engage in open and respectful dialogue to navigate these challenging times.",

The footage, released on Thursday, reportedly shows Project Veritas infiltrating RCA through an unnamed individual who took undercover footage of the group's ultra-secretive meetings.\n\nThe footage reveals a man identified as Nicholas Cifuni discussing the need to hide weapons from the police, stating, \"Don't be that fucking guy with the goddamn spike brass knuckles getting photos taken of you.\" He also allegedly teaches combat techniques such as eye gouging, stating, \"Practice things like an eye gouge. It takes very little pressure to injure someone's eyes.\"\n\nThe infiltrator, wearing a hoodie, ski mask, and sunglasses to protect his identity, described the process of becoming a member of Antifa, stating he was a \"prospect\" for the group. By his account, RCA enforced strict security measures, such as placing their phones in a neighboring bathroom with a fan that muffles sounds during meetings to prevent surveillance.\n\nThe source went on to show the vigorous security precautions deployed by the group upon their first meeting, remarking, \"They were getting this tradecraft from someone else, someone with much more experience, someone who did this for a living.\"\n\nProject Veritas identified the alleged founder of Rose City Antifa as Caroline Victorin, who previously lived in Sweden with her Swedish husband. Records uncovered by \u2588\u2588\u2588 indicate the couple moved in 2017 following a 2015 Gofundme fundraiser that attempted to procure funds for a green card for Caroline's husband.\n\nSweden has a large Antifa scene; a Swedish Defence Research Institute (FOI) report detailed the extent of the movement and tied the Swedish \"anti-hate\" group, the Expo Foundation, along with the UK anti-hate group Hope not Hate to the Antifa anarchist scene. Both groups have also received cash in the past from Hungarian-American left-wing billionaire George Soros through his Open Society Foundation.\n\nBased in the city of Portland, RCA has become well-known as one of the most violent cells of Antifa in the United States and has been well-documented by journalist Andy Ngo. Ngo himself was brutally beaten by the group during a protest last year and suffered a brain bleed as a result.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced plans to designate the violent leftist group Antifa as a terrorist organization in May 2020. The group has been linked to several violent incidents during the ongoing riots that began in Minneapolis, and RCA has also been active in Portland in recent days. They are allegedly behind a May 30 attack on a man carrying an American flag during the anti-police brutality protest, shouting, \"Black lives matter, faggot,\" as they beat him.",

The attack, which left five employees dead and two more injured, occurred on Thursday when a gunman entered the building with a shotgun and opened fire.\n\nChase Cook, a Capital Gazette reporter, tweeted, \"We are putting out a damn paper tomorrow.\" Staff members worked in the parking lot to ensure the publication of the newspaper. The gunman was arrested shortly after the incident and has been charged with five counts of first-degree murder.\n\nThe suspect, identified as Jarrod Ramos, is reported to have unsuccessfully sued the newspaper group for defamation in 2012. The Capital Gazette published obituaries for their fallen colleagues and shared the front page of their Friday paper on social media.\n\nThe shooting, which occurred at 14:40 local time (18:40 GMT), sent shockwaves through the newsroom as journalists posted updates on social media as the gunman fired through the glass door of the office. Anthony Messenger, an intern at the paper, tweeted during the attack. Selene San Felice, a staff member, told CNN that her initial reaction was to lie down under her desk.\n\nPhil Davis, a crime reporter who was also in the building, told The Baltimore Sun that he and his colleagues hid under their desks during the attack. \"I don't know why he stopped [shooting],\" he told the paper. He described the scene as \"like a war zone\" and shared his experiences as he waited to be interviewed by police.\n\nCounty executive Steve Schuh told CNN that the suspect had been hiding under a desk in the building when police officers arrived \"within 60 seconds\" of receiving news of the incident. There was \"no exchange of fire,\" he added.\n\nWilliam Krampf, deputy chief of Anne Arundel County Police, stated that the gunman had entered the building with a shotgun and \"looked for his victims as he walked through the lower level.\" An item believed to be an explosive device was found at the premises and destroyed, but later turned out to be a smoke bomb.\n\nPolice safely evacuated 170 people from the building, which housed 30 other businesses. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that before the Maryland shooting, seven journalists had been killed in the US in relation to their work since 1992.\n\nThe Capital Gazette reportedly wrote an article in 2011 about a woman who said Jarrod Ramos was stalking her, and he failed in his attempts to sue the paper for defamation the following year. Police did not ascribe any motive after arresting him following Thursday's attack.\n\nRamos is scheduled for a bail hearing on Friday morning in Annapolis. Federal agencies, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were involved in the response to the attack.\n\nMaryland governor Larry Hogan expressed his condolences on Twitter, stating he was \"absolutely devastated\" and in contact with authorities. President Donald Trump tweeted his \"thoughts and prayers\" were with the victims and their families. The White House Press Secretary, Sarah Sanders, later condemned the attack on \"innocent journalists doing their job.\"\n\nThe New York City Police Department (NYPD) deployed counterterrorism teams to media organizations in and around New York City as a precaution. Mayor of Annapolis Gavin Buckley told the Guardian he could not understand how the paper \"could make someone that hostile.\"\n\n\"If this is an attack on journalism, it is a sad state of affairs,\" he said. \"Because journalists, you don't get paid enough to put your life on the line, we're not in some war zone, we're not in some third-world country with a dictator.\"\n\nDemocratic senator Chris Van Hollen responded to a Gazette reporter on Twitter. Writer and alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos has faced criticism online for a controversial tweet about journalists. Mr. Yiannopoulos has since defended himself, stating the message was \"a troll.\"",
    " Title: Trump Delivers Unifying Address to Nation, Outlines Policy Priorities\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON -- In a bid to unify a divided nation and inspire the future, President Donald Trump delivered a speech to Congress on Tuesday, outlining his policy priorities and reaffirming his commitment to keeping his campaign promises.\n\nThe president set the tone with a public commemoration of Black History Month while reflecting on the work that remains to be done. He addressed recent threats targeting the Jewish community, vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, and the shooting in Kansas City, stating, \"We are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.\"\n\nEducation was highlighted as the \"civil rights issue of our day,\" with the president suggesting that allowing school choice will help revitalize urban regions and failing minority youths. He also doubled down on his promise to get tough on illegal immigration, stating, \"We are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens.\"\n\nIn a moving moment, the president recognized Carryn Owens, the widow of Senior Chief William \"Ryan\" Owens, who was killed last month in a covert raid against al-Qaeda in Yemen. He also called on Congress to dream big and dare bold moves for the nation, stating, \"This is our vision. This is our mission.\"\n\nThe Democratic response was delivered by former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, who criticized the president for rolling back regulations, waging war on immigrants, and calling to repeal Obamacare.\n\nCongressional members had a lot to say about President Trump's joint address, with many praising his unifying message and statesman-like demeanor. However, some expressed concerns about the lack of specifics in the president's speech, particularly regarding his budget and healthcare proposals.\n\nRepublican lawmakers feel encouraged and are ready to work on priorities like immigration reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare. Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell met with President Trump ahead of his speech and told the media they are on board with the president's bold agenda.",
    " Title: Controversy Erupts Over Alleged Skinny-Dipping Incident by GOP Congressmen in Israel\n\nArticle:\n\nA controversial report by Politico detailing a late-night skinny-dipping incident involving several Republican congressmen during a trip to Israel last year has sparked a series of clarifications and accusations between two primary opponents.\n\nThe report, which has since been met with denials and counter-accusations, claims the FBI investigated the incident, which took place during a visit by a group of GOP freshmen and leaders as guests of The American Israel Educational Foundation.\n\nAccording to the report, Kansas Rep. Kevin Yoder was among those who stripped naked and jumped into the water that night, with several other lawmakers and staff members also participating, some of whom were clothed or partially clothed. Alcohol may have been a factor for some, the report suggests.\n\nThe congressmen named in the report include Florida Rep. Steve Southerland, New York Rep. Tom Reed, California Rep. Jeff Denham, and New York Rep. Michael Grimm. The report also named Arizona Rep. Ben Quayle as participating, but his office and his wife vehemently denied his involvement.\n\nJay Heiler, Quayle's spokesman, told Fox News that Politico's inclusion of the congressman in the beach scenes was inaccurate. He stated that people were leaving the dinner that night at different times, and Quayle did not go to the beach afterward.\n\nQuayle's primary opponent, Rep. Dave Schweikert, has since accused Quayle of embarrassing \"both the institution of Congress and Arizona with his completely inappropriate behavior that calls into question yet again his fitness to be in Congress.\"\n\nIn response, Quayle's wife, Tiffany, claimed the Quayle family did not partake in the water antics, despite the Politico report. \"Ben and I and our daughter Evie were there together that evening in the Holy Land, although I was eight and a half months pregnant with her,\" she said. \"We were neither party nor witness to any of the inappropriate behavior described in the article, nor were we a part of, or aware of any inquiry. We did return to Arizona with some water from the Sea of Galilee to baptize Evie after she was born.\"\n\nThe Sea of Galilee is where Jesus is said to have walked on water.\n\nIn a statement to the Kansas City Star, Yoder expressed remorse for any embarrassment caused. \"I feel incredibly remorseful that I have caused embarrassment to my constituents and I have caused folks who believe in me to be disappointed,\" he said.\n\nThe incident has been rebuked by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the most senior Republican on the trip and the most senior Jewish lawmaker in Congress.",
    " Title: FBI's Handling of YouTube Comment Raises Questions Amidst Ongoing Florida School Shooting Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent mass shooting at a Florida high school has sparked renewed discussions about the FBI's role in identifying potential threats and preventing such tragedies. Last fall, a Mississippi bail bondsman and video blogger reported a comment on one of his YouTube videos that read, \"I'm going to be a professional school shooter.\" The commenter's username was \"Nikolas Cruz,\" the same name as the 19-year-old suspect in the shooting. However, the FBI has yet to conclusively link the account to the shooter.\n\nOn Thursday, FBI Special Agent in Charge of the Miami office, Robert Lasky, stated that the agency interviewed the man who reported the comment and searched public records databases, actions consistent with those taken during an FBI assessment, the lowest level and least intrusive stage of an FBI inquiry. Yet, they were unable to identify the poster.\n\nThe day before the shooting, Cruz, armed with an AR-15 rifle, entered his former high school in Florida and opened fire, killing 17 people. This incident follows a series of attacks in the last two years, including the Orlando nightclub massacre, the New York City bombings, and the Florida airport shooting, where the perpetrators had all been looked at by federal agents but were later deemed not to warrant continued law enforcement scrutiny.\n\nFBI assessments are initiated following tips, which can be as simple as observing unusual activity in a neighbor's garage or a classmate's comments. Agents often face the challenge of sifting through the tens of thousands of tips received each year to identify potential threats. Had the FBI been able to confirm Cruz was the same person as the YouTube poster, they would have found numerous photos of rifles, ammunition, and targets filled with bullet holes, likely leading to a face-to-face interview. The FBI did not notify police in Florida about the post before the mass shooting.\n\nRetired FBI Assistant Director Ron Hosko stated, \"They owe us some more detail on what they did.\" The questions arise as the FBI is under scrutiny and facing criticism from President Donald Trump and some congressional Republicans, who have accused the agency of anti-Trump bias, particularly in relation to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether the FBI dropped the ball in this case, according to Hosko. \"With anything that the FBI receives, they are constrained to act based on what they have in front of them,\" said Hosko. \"You have a random internet posting that suggests the person wants to do something, not that they are planning on doing something.\"\n\nFBI guidelines balance national security with civil liberties protections, imposing restrictions on the steps agents may take during the assessment phase. Agents can analyze information from government databases and open-source internet searches, and conduct interviews during an assessment. However, they cannot request wiretaps or internet communications without higher levels of approval and a more solid basis to suspect a crime.\n\n\"It's a tricky situation because sometimes you get information regarding individuals and they may be just showing off, blustering,\" said Herbert Cousins Jr., a retired FBI special agent in charge. A vague, uncorroborated threat alone may not be enough to proceed to the next level of investigation, according to Jeffrey Ringel, a former FBI agent and Joint Terrorism Task force supervisor who now works for the Soufan Group, a private security firm.\n\nMany assessments are closed within days or weeks when the FBI concludes there's no criminal or national security threat, or basis for continued scrutiny. The system is designed to ensure that a person who has not broken the law does not remain under perpetual scrutiny on a mere hunch\u2014and that the FBI can reserve its scarce resources for true threats.\n\nTips like the one that came in about the Florida gunman are among countless complaints that come into the FBI daily with varying degrees of specificity. \"How many of these do you expect the FBI to handle before it becomes the Federal Bureau of Complaints?\" said retired FBI Assistant Director Ron Hosko. \"They could spend their entire workforce tracking down internet exchanges that never going to go anywhere.\"",
    " Title: Putin's Timely Intervention Saves Obama from Congressional Defeat, but at What Cost?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the latest Syrian crisis, the return of Congress from their summer recess found the nation's future leaders immersed in the rigors of college life. The Class of '17, having been coached to impress college interviewers with tales of global adventures and intellectual pursuits, now find themselves on elite campuses with state-of-the-art facilities and sustainable dining options.\n\nHowever, the question remains: what are they learning? With the liberal arts diminished in many institutions, students are less likely to be trained in the art of critical analysis and rhetoric, skills that are crucial in understanding history and literature, and in navigating the complexities of political discourse.\n\nRecently, the Syrian crisis, which had put President Barack Obama in a tight spot, took an unexpected turn when Russian President Vladimir Putin intervened, effectively rescuing Obama from a potential defeat in Congress. The White House has since claimed that Obama's \"toughness\" was instrumental in the favorable turn of events, but the world knows that Putin was the true victor.\n\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry's gaffe, inviting an improbable rescue, mirrors the ancient Greek dramatic device known as deus ex machina, a \"god out of the machine\" that is used to resolve a seemingly insoluble problem in a play. Aristotle warned against using this device, as it lacks credibility and undermines the believability of the story. Presidents, like playwrights, should avoid relying on such deus ex machina, and instead find a more credible solution to their problems.\n\nThe Putin rescue operation has been hailed as a \"victory\" for Obama by some, but Washington and the West cannot afford another such victory. Putin, as the improbable god in the machine, has effectively taken control of the Syrian conflict and the Middle East, delaying aid to the rebels who had hoped for support. The debate over the Syrian atrocity, which Obama had promised would be a national conversation, has been effectively silenced, decided by who best exploited and manipulated Kerry's gaffe.\n\nSuzanne Fields, a columnist for The \u2588\u2588\u2588 and nationally syndicated, questions the value of such a resolution, and the loss of common cultural knowledge that results from the diminished study of the Greek and Roman classics. The ability to reason together, through the use of analogies and metaphors, is a lost skill, and one that is crucial in understanding and navigating the complexities of political discourse.\n\nPutin's timely intervention has saved Obama from a potential defeat, but at what cost? The debate over Syria, and the future of the Middle East, has been effectively silenced, and the world is left to wonder what lessons have been learned, and what the future holds.",
    " Title: Secret Service Director Julia Pierson Resigns Following White House Security Breach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a sudden turn of events, United States Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned on Wednesday, following a series of high-profile security incidents that raised concerns about the safety of the President and his family. The resignation was announced by Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson in a written statement, and was later confirmed by the White House.\n\nPresident Obama stated that new leadership was required for the agency, according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. Johnson, in his statement, said, \"Today, Julia Pierson, the Director of the United States Secret Service, offered her resignation, and I accepted it. I salute her 30 years of distinguished service to the Secret Service and the Nation.\"\n\nA source familiar with the situation told Fox News that Johnson told Pierson the resignation would be effective immediately, after she offered it. The resignation comes just days after an intruder jumped the White House fence and made it to the East Room before being apprehended on September 19.\n\nOn Tuesday, despite Pierson's rocky performance during congressional testimony, the White House voiced support for her leadership. However, on Wednesday, Pierson was facing bipartisan calls to step down. Rep. Elijah Cummings, top Democrat on the committee that grilled Pierson, notably told NPR she is \"not the person to lead that agency.\"\n\nWhen asked about the reasons leading to her resignation, Earnest said Pierson had offered her resignation, and that recent and accumulating reports had raised \"legitimate questions\" about the agency. Johnson said that a \"panel of independent experts\" should review the September 19 incident, and that such a panel will submit its assessment and recommendations by December 15.\n\nJohnson also appointed Joseph Clancy, a former special agent in charge of the Presidential Protective Division who retired in 2011, as interim director. The September 19 incident involving a Texas Army veteran who jumped the White House fence and was able to make it deep into the Executive Mansion before being stopped is now just one of several embarrassing disclosures about lapses in presidential security involving the Secret Service.",
    " Title: U.S. Sanctions and Criticism Mount as Turkey Presses Ahead with Syria Offensive\n\nArticle:\n\nAmidst growing international criticism, Turkey has vowed to continue its military operation in northern Syria, disregarding U.S. sanctions and calls for a halt. The decision has sparked controversy, with many questioning the strategic and moral implications of the move.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal from Syria, initially advocated by President Donald Trump, has been met with criticism due to the potential consequences. Critics argue that the move could lead to the release of thousands of Islamic State fighters, ethnic cleansing, and the empowerment of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nSome argue that the decision to withdraw stands apart from past instances of Washington abandoning allies, as the status quo was sustainable. American forces were not taking high numbers of casualties, and the region under the control of the Kurds was largely quiet. Islamic State fighters were penned up, and there was no major international pressure for the United States to withdraw.\n\nIf the Trump administration had wanted to accommodate Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's pleas for stronger actions, it could have done so in a more measured and coordinated manner, critics contend. The decision has been criticized as making little strategic sense and as a message to the world's rogues that a U.S. President has little interest in engaging on behalf of American allies or interests.\n\nIn response to the Turkish offensive, the U.S. has imposed sanctions, a move that has become the Trump administration's consistent response to complex global problems. However, critics argue that these sanctions may not be effective in stopping a military assault in real-time.\n\nAs the U.S. troops scramble to safely withdraw from the affected areas, and the Kurds have signed on to cooperate with Assad's Syrian army, the long-term consequences of the U.S.'s support for Turkey's invasion are becoming apparent. To mitigate the damage, some suggest that the U.S. should take responsibility for making the proposed buffer zone safe, as what is currently a military onslaught could quickly become a humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn conclusion, the U.S.'s decision to withdraw from Syria and Turkey's subsequent military operation in northern Syria has been met with criticism from both sides. The move has been criticized for its strategic and moral implications, and the effectiveness of the U.S.'s response, in the form of sanctions, has been questioned. The long-term consequences of the decision are becoming apparent, and the U.S. is now facing the challenge of mitigating the damage.",
    " Title: Rand Paul Navigates Challenges in Advancing Libertarian Agenda on College Campuses\n\nArticle:\n\nRand Paul, the Kentucky Senator and potential 2016 presidential candidate, is visiting various college campuses to promote his libertarian agenda. However, the Republican faces a challenge in appealing to young people without alienating other Republicans.\n\nDuring a recent appearance at the College of Charleston, Paul, who is known for his libertarian views, was confronted with questions on controversial topics such as abortion and drug policy.\n\nA student asked Paul about his stance on Plan B, the emergency contraception commonly known as the morning-after pill. Paul, who sponsored an anti-abortion bill in 2013 that defines life as beginning at fertilization, initially appeared uncomfortable with the question. He clarified that he is not opposed to birth control, stating that Plan B is essentially a two-day course of birth control pills.\n\nAnother student questioned Paul on his views on drug policy, asking if he would support the legalization of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. Paul stated that he is not in favor of drug use but believes that drug laws should be left up to the states. He cited Colorado and Washington's experimentation with legalized marijuana as an example of something that should be closely observed.\n\nPaul has had success on the college circuit, with visits to universities such as Harvard and Howard garnering positive headlines and praise from Republicans seeking to modernize the party and broaden its national appeal. However, his visits also highlight the challenge he faces in balancing his libertarian ideals with the more conservative leanings of the Republican Party.\n\nWhen asked about the legalization of hard drugs like cocaine or heroin, Paul hedged, stating that his position has not been for legalization but for less criminalization and more fair adjudication for those caught in the system. He also expressed support for giving young people a second chance.\n\nOn the topic of same-sex marriage, Paul favors traditional marriage but believes that states should determine their own marriage laws. When asked about the Republican Party's perceived disconnect with younger generations on this issue, Paul acknowledged the changing attitudes towards same-sex marriage but maintained his traditionalist views.\n\nThe interview revealed Paul's delicate dance as he navigates the Republican Party's conservative leanings while attempting to appeal to young voters with his libertarian views. When asked if he could reconsider his stance on same-sex marriage, Paul did not provide a definitive answer, instead expressing a nuanced view on the evolving issue.",
    " Title: \"Political Week in Review: Events, Elections, and Controversies Shape the Presidential Race\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a series of violent incidents involving police and citizens, the political landscape in the United States has been significantly altered. Last week, two black men were shot dead by police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, leading to a violent response by a black extremist in Dallas, Texas, who killed five police officers.\n\nThe events have intruded into the presidential campaign, with cop shootings and violence against police becoming front and center issues for the foreseeable future. With additional attacks on police and protests against police shootings across the country, many Americans are deeply concerned that the country is coming apart.\n\nBoth candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, have responded to the situation. Trump strongly defended the police, while calling the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile \"senseless\" and stating that \"racial divisions have gotten worse.\" Clinton, on the other hand, appeared at a conference of black religious leaders to urge national guidelines for use of force by police.\n\nAs the country grapples with these issues, the candidates are not just politicians or office-seekers; they are being sought as healers for the nation. Both candidates have strengths in dealing with these issues, with Trump being viewed as a strong leader and a true supporter of law enforcement, and Clinton adopting a more unifying tone in her campaign and striving to be more emphatic with the African-American community.\n\nThe email controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton also continued last week, with FBI Director James Comey finding Clinton guilty of setting up an unauthorized private email server, being \"extremely reckless\" in handling classified material, and making false statements to the American people. However, Comey refused to indict Clinton, a decision that has not gone away.\n\nClinton and her surrogates have stated that the fact that she escaped indictment means this issue is now old news. However, she has been found guilty in the court of public opinion as dishonest and untrustworthy, and the \"chance\" meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the report in the New York Times that Clinton might keep Lynch as A.G. added to the perception that there is one set of rules for the Clintons and one for everyone else.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, spent most of his Cincinnati speech on Wednesday defending his campaign's use of a Star of David in a weekend tweet, rather than focusing on Clinton's email scandal. Trump's failure to dwell on Clinton's email scandal meant the headlines were all about the Star of David, not the case against Hillary.\n\nLooking ahead, Sanders is expected to endorse Clinton this week, but it remains to be seen if this will put an end to further challenges to the Democratic Party's rules or additional platform fights. The Republican rules and platform committees are also meeting this week in Cleveland, with potential fights over the rules and the platform. Trump is also expected to announce his running mate this week, with Newt Gingrich, former Defense Intelligence Agency Director Gen. Michael Flynn, and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence being the most likely contenders.\n\nOverall, the political landscape in the United States is fraught with controversy and division, with the presidential race being shaped by events, elections, and controversies. The candidates' responses to these issues will be crucial in determining the direction the country takes in the coming months.",
    " Title: White House and Republicans Begin Detailed Budget Negotiations, Fiscal Cliff Talks Remain Stalemated\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, President Obama's top aides presented a budget framework to Republicans on Thursday, proposing $1.6 trillion in tax increases coupled with future spending cuts to avoid the \"fiscal cliff.\" However, GOP leaders swiftly rejected the offer, urging the White House to \"get serious\" about spending cuts.\n\nThe White House's overture signifies the commencement of real, detailed discussions after weeks of negotiating over principles. Republicans have already agreed to allow the government to raise revenue, and they are seeking Democratic agreement on the need to cut major entitlements such as Medicare. Democrats, on the other hand, argue that Republicans have yet to specify the taxes they will raise or propose their own spending cuts.\n\nAt a news conference, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, called on Republicans to provide specifics on their proposals. \"Now is the time for the Republicans to move past this happy talk about revenues\u2014ill-defined, of course\u2014and put specifics on the table,\" he said, surrounded by his leadership team.\n\nThe White House's wish list includes additional stimulus spending, a call to limit Congress' control over the federal debt limit, a rise in the estate tax, and an increase in taxes on dividends. These proposals would reverse parts of President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax plans and are likely to be contentious among some Democrats, as well as with Republicans.\n\nIn exchange, President Obama reiterated his pledge to find up to $400 billion in entitlement spending cuts later, as well as to undertake a tax code overhaul.\n\nSpeaker of the House John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, stated after meeting with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner that no substantive progress has been made in the talks between the White House and the House over the past two weeks.\n\nThe White House has shown some flexibility, with President Obama calling for tax rates on upper-income earners to rise from 35 percent to 39.6 percent but being willing to accept something less in negotiations. However, they have stated that rates will have to rise somewhat.\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney said Republican leaders must \"accept the essential fact\" that tax rates on the nation's top earners must increase as part of a deficit-reduction deal. \"The president will not sign any legislation that extends the Bush-era tax cuts for the top earners in this country,\" he said.\n\nCongressional Republicans have stated that increasing tax rates is out of the question. Instead, they want the additional government revenue to come from ending tax breaks and closing loopholes.\n\nAll sides are trying to avoid the \"fiscal cliff\"\u2014the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts on January 1, followed by $110 billion in automatic spending cuts. Going over the cliff and staying there could plunge the country into a short, sharp recession, though delaying the spending cuts and tax increases would mean deeper pain in the long run, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe challenge for President Obama and Congress is to try to spread the pain while doing the least harm to the economy. The two parties have also staked out different positions on how best to increase the nation's $16.4 trillion debt limit, which the federal government could reach as early as next month.",

However, Republicans view this as a power grab and a violation of the Constitution.\n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) recently stated, \"It is a very dangerous road he\u2019s going down, contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.\" Grassley added, \"Just because Congress doesn\u2019t act doesn\u2019t mean the president has a right to act.\"\n\nOne of the more significant executive actions being considered by the president, according to the Post, would provide homeowners with a better chance to refinance their mortgages at today's low interest rates. Obama has already used his powers to make refinancing easier for people with loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but his new plan could extend opportunities to people running behind on the payments of their privately backed mortgages.\n\nThe president's decision to move forward with new executive actions is reportedly due to his conclusion that Republicans are unlikely to pass many of his major agenda items. The full extent of the executive actions and their impact remains to be seen, but they are sure to spark debate and controversy in the coming weeks.",

Christie, on the other hand, is under investigation for his role in the Sandy aid controversy, making him vulnerable on multiple fronts.\n\nThe No. 2 contender, Senator Marco Rubio, has also faded from the spotlight after his attempt to court the center with immigration reform and his subsequent shift to the right. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who was lucky to make it to the No. 7 spot, flamed out after his controversial comments about the Republican Party and his unpopularity among voters.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz, who was not on the initial list, has imploded due to his self-promoting and divisive political style. Senator Rand Paul, who made several lists, has been criticized for his plagiarism issues and politically risky foreign policy views.\n\nRepresentative Paul Ryan, who was No. 5 on the list, has struggled to make a significant impact, with his only contribution to the 2012 ticket being a perceived negative influence on Mitt Romney. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who is receiving renewed attention due to Christie's troubles, is facing ethical challenges within his own administration.\n\nThis leaves former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who is beloved by the GOP establishment but disliked by the Tea Party. His ties to Wall Street and his role in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy could potentially be a liability in the current political climate.\n\nSouth Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, South Dakota Senator John Thune, and Indiana Representative Mike Pence round out the remaining contenders from the National Journal's initial list.

Robert A. Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, has outlined a list of top risks to watch for in 2020.\n\n1. 2020 Elections: The outcome of the U.S. elections, whether it's a Trump reelection or a Democratic victory, is expected to deepen political tribalism in the United States. A Trump victory could result in four more years of U.S. withdrawal from the multilateral world order, leading to a global leadership deficit. A narrow Trump loss could cause domestic political turmoil, while a Democratic victory and left-leaning economic policies could fuel uncertainty and market turmoil.\n\n2. Brexit: The United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, scheduled for January 31, 2020, is certain. However, political and economic uncertainties abound. A U.K.-EU trade deal may drag out beyond 2020, leading to the breakup of the United Kingdom, as the Scottish Nationalist Party pursues another independence referendum and Irish nationalist MPs strong election performance in Northern Ireland positions them to ponder their future. London's global financial hub is also at risk.\n\n3. North Korean Defiance: North Korea's nuclear ambitions pose the most immediate challenge of the new nuclear age. Whether there is another Trump-Kim summit or not, tensions are likely to rise in 2020 as Pyongyang continues developing strategic weapons. Kim Jong-un's New Year's Day speech offered a potential summit, but Kim has escalated his blackmail efforts, threatening a \"new path\" with powerful strategic weapons if the U.S. fails to make concessions.\n\n4. The Great Unraveling: The World Trade Organization (WTO), the key enabler of 70 years of prosperity and a rules-based economic order, may become defunct. In the best-case scenario, after a lapse of six to 24 months, a new arbitration mechanism with a much-reduced mandate and a reformed, but also diminished in scope and authority, WTO may emerge. However, universal rules and enforcement will be less important in shaping the terms of trade than large countries using their market size to weaponize trade via tariffs.\n\n5. A Bifurcated World: The decoupling of the world's two largest economies, the United States and China, amid growing techno-nationalism on both sides, is driving a new global economic dynamic. The main elements of Beijing's predatory mercantilism remain largely undiluted, while Washington is seeking to disrupt supply chains linking the United States and China, cutting off investment, scientific exchanges, and tech exports and imports from China.\n\n6. Gray Swan: A China reckoning/world financial crisis: A perfect storm involving a simultaneous slowdown in the three economic centers (U.S., China, and EU) and the U.S.-China decoupling could catapult the global economy into another deep economic crisis. China's internal contradictions, including massive public, household, and corporate debt, aging demographics, and sagging growth, offer a preview of the costs to the U.S. of a bifurcated global economy.\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list, but an assessment of top risks to watch for. Other potential conflicts in the greater Middle East, such as Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Iran, are percolating, and proxy or real U.S. conflict with Iran is within the realm of the plausible. All things considered, 2020 promises to be a wild ride. The one risk you won't have to worry about is boredom.",
    " Title: Attorney General Eric Holder to Attend Paris Rally Against Terrorism, Declines to Label U.S. as at War with \"Radical Islam\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder will represent the United States at Sunday's rally against terrorism in Paris, France, according to news reports. President Barack Obama has no public events scheduled, and Secretary of State John Kerry is on a trip to India.\n\nThe rally, which millions are expected to attend, will feature several European heads of state and dozens of high-level delegations from other countries. The demonstration is a response to last week's deadly attacks by radical Islamic terrorists on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket, in which twelve and four people were killed, respectively.\n\nIn a previous testimony to Congress in May 2010, Holder refused to blame radical Islam in addressing the possible motives of terrorists who had recently launched attacks against the United States. \"I don't want to say anything negative about a religion,\" he said.\n\nHolder has been less careful around matters of race in the United States. He and President Barack Obama have been accused of creating an atmosphere of mistrust in the debate over the deaths of unarmed black suspects at the hands of police\u2013an atmosphere that critics blame for attacks on police, including the assassination of two New York Police Department officers on patrol in an anti-terror exercise last month.\n\nHolder has also sought to try terrorists in federal, civilian courts rather than at military tribunals in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. His department investigated the Central Intelligence Agency's use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" but declined to prosecute any agents. Instead of extended questioning, the U.S. now reads terror suspects their Miranda rights fairly soon after apprehension, under new Department of Justice policies.\n\nIn addition, Holder has shown lenience to terrorists in the past. During the administration of Bill Clinton, he reportedly pushed the Department of Justice to drop its objection to the commutations of sentences for members of a Puerto Rican terrorist group.\n\nFox News reports that Holder will also be participating in meetings in Paris with international counterparts about stopping terror attacks. Holder will also be the featured guest on five major Sunday morning news programs, except for Fox News Sunday.\n\nPresident Obama is focused on his domestic agenda, and is preparing to continue a nationwide tour this week to preview his upcoming State of the Union address, which will be delivered to Congress the following week. It is possible that Obama has plans to attend the rally but has not announced them for security reasons. Typically, Obama plays golf on Sunday afternoons, declining to continue a personal golf moratorium that George W. Bush initiated in deference to the fact that U.S. troops are at war abroad. There are also two important NFL playoff games on television on Sunday.\n\nUpdate: AFP's live feed from the rally shows heads of state and foreign dignitaries marching through Paris.\n\nUpdate: Pressed by ABC News' George Stephanopoulos Sunday morning to answer whether the U.S. is at war with \"radical Islam,\" Holder again declined. \"I would say that we are at war with terrorists who commit these heinous acts and who use Islam. They use a corrupted version of Islam to justify their actions,\" he said on This Week with George Stephanopoulos.",
    " Title: Opinion: The Left's Inconsistent Response to the Pandemic: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the political landscape in the United States has been marked by a significant divide in response strategies and public discourse. This article aims to provide a neutral analysis of the left's position on the nation's response to the pandemic, focusing on the inconsistencies and potential implications of their approach.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic, national Democratic leaders, left-leaning media, and some anti-Trump figures have been criticized for their focus on attacking President Donald Trump rather than addressing the myriad issues caused by the coronavirus. The left has been accused of adopting contradictory stances, criticizing Trump for both overreacting and underreacting to the virus.\n\nBefore the outbreak, numerous Democrats downplayed the virus and condemned Trump's China and Europe travel bans. However, as the virus spread, they shifted their criticism towards Trump, accusing him of not taking the virus seriously, despite the fact that they were initially taking a less serious approach themselves.\n\nFrom the beginning, President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and their medical team have been conducting daily press briefings to inform the public about the virus and the government's efforts to slow its spread. These briefings have been used by the media to criticize Trump rather than to inform the public. For instance, New York Magazine's Olivia Nuzzi asked Trump, \"If an American President loses more Americans over the course of six weeks than died in the entirety of the Vietnam War, does he deserve to be reelected?\"\n\nEditorials have excoriated Trump for every imaginable sin and certainly every death, while exempting Democratic governors from any accountability for disproportionate cases and deaths in their states. They view the crisis through a partisan prism, exploiting it for political gain.\n\nTrump has been accused of being solely interested in using the crisis to enhance his reelection efforts. He has been criticized for expressing hope to reopen the economy on Easter and for not listening to medical experts. However, Trump has been deferring to the medical experts, who have repeatedly denied that he is ignoring them.\n\nThe left's reduction of concerns for the financially devastated to class-warfare soundbites, such as Joe Biden's \"No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow,\" has been criticized as shallow and insensitive. Similarly, the Lincoln Project's ad \"Mourning in America,\" which blames Trump for both the deaths from the virus and the economic devastation, has been seen as a convenient and one-dimensional approach to the crisis.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that the pandemic presents complex challenges that do not lend themselves to easy solutions. There is no perfect response, and there will be deaths and financial destruction. The focus should be on mitigating both, working together to reopen the economy while preventing new outbreaks. State governments should show faith in the American people and respect their prerogative to return to their lives, while exercising responsible behavior to protect themselves and their neighbors.\n\nIn conclusion, this article aims to provide a neutral analysis of the left's response to the pandemic, highlighting the inconsistencies and potential implications of their approach. It is essential to approach the crisis with a balanced perspective, recognizing the complexities and challenges it presents, and working together to find solutions that prioritize the health and well-being of all Americans.",
    " Title: The Collapse of Confederate Nostalgia: A Shift in Political Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the racially-motivated shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, the removal of the Confederate flag from statehouses across the nation has become a significant political development. This shift, however, was not an expected outcome, as the flag has long been a symbol of Confederate nostalgia and a contentious issue in American politics.\n\nThe change can be attributed to a combination of generational replacement and increased political polarization. The last Civil War general died in the 1930s, and those with personal connections to the Civil War are now increasingly rare. This generational shift has relegated the Confederacy to history, even if its sympathizers persist.\n\nMoreover, the most crucial factor in the removal of the flag is the rise of political polarization. In the past, lower-income rural whites, who were not a reliable part of the Republican coalition, held the key to winning in the South. However, in recent years, these voters have begun voting Republican from the top of the ticket to the bottom, and Democrats have either written off the region or formed coalitions of minorities, urban liberals, and suburbanites rather than of minorities, urban liberals, and poor whites.\n\nWith Democrats no longer seeing any electoral payoff in courting rural Southerners, they no longer have any incentive to make even weak gestures toward keeping the flag around. Progressives are now freed from their need to maintain a delicate dance with rural Southerners for the sake of maintaining some degree of power in the South. Polarization has forced them \u2013 and freed them \u2013 to explore new paths to power.\n\nIt is also essential to recognize that most prominent Southern Republican politicians have roots in either the suburban or old establishment Democrat wings of the party. With rural whites now largely polarized into the Republican column, Southern Republicans no longer have to go hard after their votes. If anything, they need to watch their flanks in the suburbs and in the business wing of the party, and so it is now more natural for them to move against the flag.\n\nIn conclusion, the removal of the Confederate flag from statehouses across the nation is a significant political development, reflecting a shift in the political landscape due to generational replacement and increased political polarization. This change may signal a broader movement away from symbols of racial oppression and toward a more inclusive and equitable society.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton to Highlight Depression-Era Upbringing in Mother's Footsteps at Campaign Rally\n\nIn a strategic move to emphasize her personal connection to the American middle class, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is set to delve into the lesser-known story of her mother, Dorothy Rodham, at her first major campaign rally this Saturday.\n\nClinton's team has revealed that she will draw upon lessons learned from her mother's Depression-era upbringing, where she was abandoned by her parents and had to fend for herself. This narrative is intended to underscore Clinton's personal journey and her commitment to fighting for the middle class, a demographic she aims to represent in the White House.\n\nJennifer Palmieri, the campaign's communications director, commented, \"She is a well-known figure, but when you're asking the American people to support you as president, even if it is for the second time, there is no skipping of steps. If you want to understand Hillary Clinton, and what has motivated her career of fighting for kids and families, her mother is a big part of the story.\"\n\nA photograph from Clinton's 50th birthday in 1997, taken in front of her childhood home in Park Ridge, Illinois, with her late mother, Dorothy Rodham, serves as a poignant reminder of this personal connection.\n\nThe rally on Roosevelt Island in New York, steeped in symbolism of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, offers Clinton an opportunity to redefine her candidacy and present a more comprehensive argument for her presidential bid. Some Democrats have expressed that Clinton and her campaign have yet to clearly articulate why she is the best candidate for the job.\n\nThis shift in focus was a topic of discussion at a dinner Clinton attended last week at the home of Sen. Dianne Feinstein in Washington. The intimate gathering, attended by several other Democratic women senators, provided a platform for candid conversations about Clinton's candidacy.",
    " Title: Bloomberg's Controversial Presence in Selma's Civil Rights Commemoration\n\nArticle:\n\nMichael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and current Democratic presidential candidate, found himself in the midst of controversy during a historic event in Selma, Alabama, on Sunday. The 55th anniversary of the 1965 civil rights march, known as \"Bloody Sunday,\" saw Bloomberg attending the commemoration, an event that was initially met with resistance from some members of the community.\n\nBloomberg's decision to attend the event, which took place on the eve of Super Tuesday, was a departure from his initial response to an invitation from Rev. Leodis Strong. The former mayor had initially declined, citing his busy presidential campaign. However, a week later, he changed his mind and decided to participate in the commemoration, crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge with ailing congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis.\n\nThe presence of Bloomberg, who has been criticized for his legacy as the mayor responsible for stop-and-frisk policing, was met with a silent protest by a dozen or so churchgoers during his speech at Brown Chapel. Ryan P. Haygood, a former NAACP lawyer who directs the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, explained, \"Given what this sacred space means, I kept waiting for him to lean into it, to talk about what he presided over as mayor. When it became clear he wasn't going to atone, we decided to do something.\"\n\nThe protest, which was not planned, was a stark contrast to the boilerplate speech Bloomberg delivered. If Pete Buttigieg hadn't suspended his campaign hours later, the silent protest against Bloomberg would have been the biggest story out of Selma about any of the five candidates in attendance.\n\nNotably absent from the event was Bernie Sanders, the only candidate with an arrest record related to civil rights protest. Sanders, who has attended multiple civil rights events in Alabama over the years, has nothing to prove on that front, but his campaign has always conceded the primary and never opened an office or hired a single staffer in Montgomery.\n\nThe Alabama primary, with its large African American voter base, is a crucial test for Bloomberg's unorthodox gambit. Whether the endorsement from the Alabama Democratic Council, which Bloomberg received last month, will dig into Joe Biden's large advantage with black voters in Southern states remains to be seen.\n\nThe council, which has not been a fearsome Southern machine for a long time, has been criticized for endorsing Bloomberg due to his financial support. Pam Foster, a Tuscaloosa Medical School professor, expressed her dissent, stating, \"Reed and the ADC endorsed Bloomberg because he bought off a lot of people. [They want us] to forget that in New York, he ignored the African American community. I voted my conscience and voted Biden.\"\n\nThe Sanders campaign's decision to not open an office or hire staff in Montgomery, the state's capital, reflects the candidate's concession of the primary. In 2016, Alabama gave Hillary Clinton her second-highest margin of victory against Sanders, nearly 78 percent of the vote, mirroring her win in neighboring Mississippi. In 44 of Alabama's 67 counties, Sanders lost by 50 points or more.\n\nThe reasons for the candidate with the most credible and demonstrated commitment to addressing poverty being so roundly rejected by Deep South communities scarred by endemic hardcore poverty are not easily or neatly answered. However, the presence of Bloomberg in Selma, amidst the commemoration of a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement, has sparked a conversation about the role of money in politics and the expectations of candidates, particularly those with controversial pasts, in the African American community.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Review Constitutionality of U.S. Passport Policy for Jerusalem-Born Citizens\n\nThe United States Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on Monday in a case that intertwines Middle Eastern politics with the shared foreign policy roles of the President and Congress. The case, which revolves around the birthplace notation on U.S. passports for citizens born in Jerusalem, has been a contentious issue since the establishment of Israel in 1948.\n\nThe U.S. has historically maintained that no country holds sovereignty over Jerusalem until its status is resolved through a Middle East peace agreement. However, supporters of Israel in Congress have attempted to institute a different policy, passing legislation that would move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and require the State Department to allow U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem to list Israel as their place of birth on their passports.\n\nBoth the Bush and Obama administrations declined to comply with this mandate, arguing that it unconstitutionally infringes on the President's foreign policy powers. The case in question, initially brought by Menachem Zivotofsky, a U.S. citizen born in Jerusalem to American parents who now maintain dual citizenship, seeks to force the State Department to list Israel as his place of birth on his passport.\n\nIn 2011, when the case first went to the Supreme Court, the justices did not issue a definitive ruling, instead remanding the case back to the lower court for further action. Now, the case is back before the Supreme Court, and a review of the 2011 argument offers insight into the justices' thinking.\n\nDuring the 2011 argument, Nathan Lewin, the Zivotofskys' lawyer, argued that under the Constitution, foreign policy is a power shared by the President and Congress, but that Congress has the final say once it passes a statute, as it did in this case. However, Lewin faced a barrage of skeptical questions from the justices.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned, \"You say foreign relations is a shared power. So, if it is a shared power, why does Congress trump the executive?\" Justice Anthony Kennedy described Lewin's view as a \"narrow and crabbed interpretation of the president's foreign affairs power.\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated, \"It seems to me you're not arguing for a co-equal congressional power, you're arguing for a superior congressional power. You\u2019re saying whatever Congress says, the president has to comply with.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts noted that listing Israel as the place of birth for someone born in Jerusalem could potentially present foreign policy problems. However, Lewin rejected this premise, stating, \"Congress has decided that saying Israel alone does not present a foreign policy issue.\"\n\nArguing for the President's exclusive authority in this area, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli told the justices that Congress cannot supersede the President's power. However, Justice Stephen Breyer questioned this proposition, stating, \"There are very few cases I can ever think of where the court has said the president can act contrary to a statute.\"\n\nVerrilli replied that, since President Washington, this has been one of those areas of presidential authority. The court, he argued, should give great deference to the President's judgment on a matter with such serious foreign policy implications. A passport, he observed, is not a communication by the passport holder; it's an official document communicating the position of the United States.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan pressed Verrilli, who responded that the source for the President's power is the provision of the Constitution giving the chief executive the power to receive and recognize foreign diplomats, a power used since the founding to recognize foreign governments.\n\nJustice Scalia did not find much merit in that provision as authority to rest the case on, musing, \"I mean, if you've got to cast about for something, I suppose, I do not know what else you'd land upon.\" It is there, Scalia acknowledges, \"but it does not say a whole lot.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in this case could have significant implications for the relationship between the President and Congress in matters of foreign policy and the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. The justices' deliberations will be closely watched as they grapple with the complex interplay of constitutional powers and the political sensitivities surrounding Jerusalem.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders' Revolution: A Movement Beyond the Senator\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Bernie Sanders prepares to return to his role as a U.S. Senator, his political revolution lives on, with the first step unfolding at over 2,600 house parties across the country on Wednesday night. The gatherings served as a platform for Sanders to reiterate his call for fundamental change in the country, emphasizing the importance of grassroots activism and electing like-minded candidates at all levels of government.\n\nIn his address, Sanders reiterated his belief that real change does not come from the top but from the bottom, as millions of people demand change within the country. He emphasized that change will come through electing progressive candidates, from school boards to the U.S. Senate, as well as through ballot measures in the states. Additionally, he called for Democrats to hold the party accountable for implementing the most progressive platform in party history.\n\nDuring the Democratic primaries, Sanders garnered over 12 million votes and held hundreds of enthusiastic rallies, serving as a counterpoint to Donald Trump's campaign. The question now is whether the Bernie revolution, enshrined in an organization called Our Revolution, can survive and thrive without Sanders himself.\n\nOur Revolution, a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, has faced challenges due to its tax status, which prevents Sanders from playing a role in running the group. The tax status also caused tension within the small staff, with several resigning over Sanders' decision to bring in his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, as president. The tax status allows for the acceptance of undisclosed and unlimited \"dark money,\" potentially from billionaires, a stark contrast to Sanders' campaign, which prided itself on small-dollar donations.\n\nDespite the organizational challenges, Sanders supporters remain hopeful. A group of 30 supporters gathered in a row house in Washington's Mount Pleasant neighborhood on Wednesday night, eager to hear from their leader once more. Michael Pattis, a student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, working in Washington for the summer, expressed his support for Sanders' agenda, including health care for all, criminal justice reform, and a more equitable distribution of economic growth.\n\nMaggie Ellinger-Locke, a lawyer in Arlington, Virginia, expressed her excitement for the \"down ticket\" races in November, emphasizing the importance of local politics in driving change. Both she and Pattis plan to vote for Hillary Clinton in November, but are prepared to \"trade\" their votes with third-party supporters in swing states to help prevent Donald Trump from winning crucial states.\n\nThe future of Our Revolution remains uncertain, but the group has already seen some successes. Jane Kleeb, visiting from Nebraska, recently won an upset victory in the race for chair of her state Democratic Party. Kleeb, an activist who originally opposed the Keystone XL pipeline, now aims to remake a party that has failed to win statewide office in deep red Nebraska.\n\n\"Our state party, for so many years, has not been progressive, and that has deflated the base,\" Kleeb said. \"Candidates somehow think they have to be more conservative to win. I'm a progressive Democrat, and I was able to bring this coalition of conservative folks together to defeat the pipeline.\"\n\nThe tea party movement has faded, and the Occupy movement has channeled its energy into Sanders' candidacy. For now, Sanders supporters remain hopeful, and some have already made gains in local politics. The question remains whether the Bernie revolution will continue to thrive, or if it will follow the path of other political movements that have come before it.",
    " Title: CBS News Poll Reveals Shift in American Opinion Regarding Mueller Investigation's Motivation\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CBS News poll has shown a significant change in the American public's perception of the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential collusion between President Donald Trump and the Russian government. The poll, conducted between March 25 and March 26, found that 54% of respondents now believe the investigation was \"politically motivated,\" compared to 37% who believe it was \"justified.\"\n\nIn January, the same poll found 50% of respondents believed the investigation was \"justified\" and 45% said it was \"politically motivated.\" This shift represents a growing skepticism towards the investigation's impartiality among the American public.\n\nInterestingly, the poll's findings regarding the investigation's motivation were not the primary focus of CBS's report. The headline of the report, \"Mueller report: Majorities across party lines want full report released,\" and the four tweets accompanying the article, only touched on the desire for the release of the Mueller report.\n\nThe poll also revealed that 34% of respondents feel the Mueller report, which found no collusion and not enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction, \"has cleared Trump,\" compared to 23% who think it \"hasn't cleared Trump.\" Another 36% think it's \"too soon to say\" whether the report cleared the president.\n\nPartisan differences were also evident in the poll. Sixty-six percent of Democrats want their party in Congress to continue investigating the matter, while 50% of Democrats were \"disappointed\" in Mueller's findings. In contrast, 69% of Republicans were \"pleased\" with the report.\n\nForty-four percent of respondents thought the investigation was conducted \"fairly,\" while 10% thought it was \"unfairly.\" Forty percent said it was \"too soon to say.\"\n\nThe CBS News poll provides a snapshot of the American public's evolving perception of the Mueller investigation, revealing a growing belief that the investigation may have been politically motivated. However, it's important to note that this poll is just one of many and represents the opinions of a sample of the American public.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Significant Life Expectancy Gap Between Americans and Peers in High-Income Countries Due to Injury Deaths\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association has shed light on a concerning issue: the significant life expectancy gap between Americans and their peers in high-income countries. The study, which analyzed data from 2012, found that three major causes of injury deaths - guns, drugs, and cars - account for a substantial portion of this gap.\n\nThe study compared injury death rates in the US with those in other high-income countries, including the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, and eight others. The results showed that, on average, men and women in these countries can expect to live about 2.2 years longer than their American counterparts.\n\nAmong men, gun deaths accounted for 21% of the life expectancy gap, drug overdoses for 14%, and car crashes for 13%. Among women, gun deaths accounted for 4% of the gap, drug overdoses for 9%, and car crashes for 6%.\n\nThe death rate for guns, drugs, and cars was much higher in the US than in its developed peers, as this chart shows:\n\n``Although the reasons for the gap in life expectancy at birth between the United States and comparable countries are complex, a substantial portion of this gap reflects just three causes of injury,'' study authors Andrew Fenelon, Li-Hui Chen, and Susan Baker wrote.\n\nThe study's findings highlight the need for policy changes and cultural shifts to address these issues. With guns, the research shows that America's unusually high levels of gun ownership lead to more gun violence. Tightening existing gun control measures, such as gun licensing laws, could help reduce homicides and suicides, as studies in Connecticut and Missouri suggest.\n\nWith drugs, the US is currently grappling with a devastating opioid and heroin epidemic that is killing tens of thousands of people each year. Academic analyses of the crisis have concluded that the US was too slow to respond to misleading advertising campaigns from opioid producers, leading to widespread addiction and death.\n\nWith cars, European policies began encouraging walking, cycling, and public transportation in the 1960s, while the US continued to promote sprawl and driving. The result: Americans drive much more than their European peers, and are more likely to die in crashes as a result.\n\nWhile cultural preferences may be difficult to change, better policies could help push the US in the right direction and save lives. The study's authors call for a comprehensive approach to addressing these issues, including improved access to healthcare, safer roads, and stricter gun control measures.",
    " Title: Bill Clinton Advocates for Global Unity, Cautions Against Nationalism in Post-Election Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his first major public appearance since the inauguration of Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton delivered a keynote speech at a Brookings Institute event, cautioning against the rise of nationalism and its potential to further divide the world.\n\nClinton, in his address, warned against the \"nation-state psychology\" that he believes is gaining traction, stating that it is an \"inevitable consequence of the economic and social changes that have occurred at an increasingly rapid pace.\" He argued that those who advocate for the nation-state are, in fact, promoting a \"pan-national movement to institutionalize separatism and division within borders all over the world.\"\n\nThough not explicitly referring to Trump or his chief counselor Stephen Bannon, Clinton's comments can be seen as a rebuke of the Trump-ian form of nationalist populism. Trump's overarching \"America First\" message is built on the primacy of domestic American interests over those of the world. Bannon, as the head of Breitbart, has been known for stoking resentment of immigrants and racial and religious minorities in the United States.\n\nThe Clinton family, following Hillary Clinton's defeat in the November election, has emerged as a set of reliable critics of the Trump administration. Daughter Chelsea Clinton has tweeted negatively about the administration, and Hillary herself has given a number of speeches since the election.\n\nClinton's speech also drew parallels to the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 by an extremist. Rabin, during his terms as Prime Minister, embraced the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and his efforts for unity won him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994. Citing this, Clinton said, \"We have to find a way to bring simple, personal decency and trust back to our politics.\"\n\nClinton further emphasized the importance of negotiation and compromise, stating, \"We should live by Rabin's model of negotiation and compromise. If you got that, in every age and time, the challenges we face can be resolved in a way to keep us going forward, instead of taking us to the edge of our destruction.\"\n\nClosing his speech, Clinton reiterated the need for unity, stating, \"This is a very old story. It's as old as the Holy Land, and much older. Ever since the first people stood up on the East African savanna, ever since the first families and clans, ever since people encountered the other. It is a very old story. And it always comes down to two things\u2014are we going to live in an us-and-them world, or a world that we live in together?\"",
    " Title: \"The Return of Big Brother: Tech Giants and the Pursuit of Conformity in the Digital Age\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the year 1984, a commercial by Apple, titled \"1984,\" depicted a dystopian future where a single company, Microsoft, held an iron grip on the computer world. Fast forward to the present, and it seems we are living in a reimagined version of that future. The tech giants, Apple, Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, are demanding conformity to their values, echoing the all-powerful leader from George Orwell's novel, 1984.\n\nRecently, Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, addressed a civil rights group, stating, \"We only have one message for those who seek to push hate, division, and violence: You have no place on our platforms.\" This statement, ironically delivered before a group advocating for civil rights, raises questions about the role these tech companies are playing in shaping public discourse.\n\nIf a user disagrees with the tech giants on political or moral grounds, they risk being silenced, as evidenced by the permanent ban of Canadian feminist Meghan Murphy from Twitter for refusing to use preferred pronouns and stating \"women are not men.\" Similarly, Google, Facebook, and Twitter have all refused to carry political ads from conservative candidates, such as Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn.\n\nBroad-based studies by the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology and Northwestern University have confirmed the existence of bias against conservatives on these platforms. YouTube, for instance, has restricted over 100 videos by PragerU, a conservative educational organization, deeming them \"inappropriate for children.\"\n\nThis bias, both overt and covert, is a cause for concern for those who value free speech. While the visible bias is troubling, the hidden, or \"shadow banning,\" may be even more insidious. If one leans to the left, this may be acceptable, but for those not on the left, or for those who revere the First Amendment, this trend is a cause for alarm.\n\nWe are swiftly advancing towards an Orwellian, 1984 world of stifling, one-way-of-thinking conformity. This is not a fictional story; it is real. The solution lies in returning to the open market of ideas that served these tech companies so well for so long. Stop the censorship and let people make up their own minds. Otherwise, America, and the rest of what has been known as the Free World, will cease to be free.\n\nI'm Brent Bozell, founder of the Media Research Center.",
    " Title: Climate Crisis Takes a Backseat in Democratic Debate, Activists Call for Change\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first Democratic presidential debate of 2020, the climate crisis was given less than 10 minutes of discussion, despite its potential to render large parts of the planet uninhabitable by the end of the century. This, according to journalist Kate Aronoff, is a shameful oversight that underscores the urgent need for a dedicated climate debate.\n\nAronoff, a writing fellow at In These Times, criticized NBC and Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman Tom Perez for the limited time dedicated to the climate crisis. Protesters from the Sunrise Movement, who have been advocating for a Green New Deal, are currently occupying the DNC headquarters in Washington D.C., demanding a climate-focused debate.\n\nThe debate, which lasted nearly an hour and a half, saw New Jersey Senator Cory Booker emerge as the candidate with the most speaking time, close to 11 minutes. Booker, who has been described as progressive but not extreme, made a difference in the discourse by refusing to endorse Medicare for All and acknowledging the need to check corporate consolidation without appearing anti-business.\n\nElizabeth Warren, who was widely expected to dominate the debate, also performed well, particularly in the first half. She set a populist tone, arguing that the American economy benefits only those with wealth, and framed herself as a fighter who would take on big corporations. Warren also emphasized structural change, advocating for healthcare as a basic human right, supporting Medicare for All, and highlighting the prison-industrial complex that disproportionately affects black and Latino communities.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, who was polling at just 1% and was unknown to 56% of voters before the debate, had a significant impact on the debate. He demonstrated compassion and deep knowledge of immigration law, and displayed a fighting spirit as he called attention to policy differences with fellow Texan Beto O'Rourke. This early in the primary, name recognition is crucial, and Castro's performance should help his cause substantially.\n\nThe lack of focus on the climate crisis during the debate has been met with criticism from climate activists, who argue that the future of their generation and the entire civilization is at stake. Climate change is an existential threat and is intertwined with every issue discussed during the debate, including healthcare, immigration, and the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nAs the debate progresses, it is crucial that the candidates and the media prioritize the climate crisis and address it with the urgency it deserves. A pleasing personality will not save the planet; what is needed is bold, decisive action to combat this existential threat.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Declines ExxonMobil's Appeal in Massachusetts Climate Change Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from ExxonMobil regarding Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's climate change investigation on Monday, a move legal experts described as a \"crushing blow\" to the oil giant. The Court's decision could have implications beyond the state of Massachusetts as Exxon is forced to hand over documents detailing what it knew about climate change and when.\n\nAfter the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled last April that the company must turn over documents requested by Healey, Exxon asked the Supreme Court to intervene, arguing Healey lacked jurisdiction to even bring the investigation.\n\n\"Today's decision means Exxon is out of options and out of time in its fight to keep these documents from public light,\" Carroll Muffett, president and chief executive of the Center for International Environmental Law, told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThe company is facing multiple climate lawsuits around the country. In the case of Massachusetts, like New York, the attorney general is investigating what Exxon knew about climate change and the effects of burning fossil fuels\u2014and whether it lied to the public and its investors about the risks.\n\nReports published in 2015 by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times revealed that the company was aware of the risks of burning fossil fuels as early as the 1970s, and yet continued to mislead investors.\n\n\"Courts have repeatedly rejected Exxon's attempts to stop the state attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts from investigating the company's historic knowledge about climate change and what it did with that information,\" Michael Burger, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThe denial of Exxon's petition means Healey can proceed with her investigation, and that Exxon must respond to the attorney general's civil investigation demands\u2014the subpoena-like request for documents, including transcripts of investor calls, internal scientific research, copies of public relations or media communication plans, and communication with organizations that have a history of promoting climate science denial.\n\n\"These internal documents\u2014describing what the company knew and when it knew it\u2014are critical to any fraud case that may result,\" Sharon Eubanks, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney who prosecuted and won the massive racketeering case against Big Tobacco, said. \"Without a doubt, ExxonMobil will bring further objections, but the [Court's] denial... is a crushing blow.\"\n\nHowever, Eubanks, who now works for the firm Bordas & Bordas, added that the Supreme Court's denial of Exxon's request does not set a precedent; it doesn't give an indication as to where different justices sit on the issue, it simply allows the investigation to proceed.\n\nThe mere fact that the investigation can move forward \"is a tremendous success,\" Alyssa Johl, legal counsel for the Center for Climate Integrity, said. \"Where it goes from here is to be determined\u2014it depends on what they [Exxon] disclose.\"\n\nLegal experts told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the Supreme Court's decision has wider implications beyond this particular case. In its efforts to fight the Massachusetts investigation, Exxon argued to the Supreme Court that it's an issue of jurisdiction. The company, which is headquartered in Texas, said that because it does not directly sell gasoline in Massachusetts, the attorney general does not have jurisdiction to investigate.\n\nIn essence, Exxon tried to argue that its service stations across the state are franchises, and not part of the company itself. And it was this argument that the Massachusetts court rejected earlier in 2018, \"on the simple grounds that Exxon's standard franchise agreement gives the company significant control over how its products were marketed in the state,\" said Muffett.\n\nTherefore, the Supreme Court's decision is \"basically affirming, for now, the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that the AG has jurisdiction over ExxonMobil,\" explained Eubanks.\n\nUpholding this decision not only means the case can proceed but hints that other states might be able to look to Massachusetts for inspiration down the road.\n\n\"The Massachusetts investigation poses an even bigger risk for the company because the pool of Exxon's potential victims includes not only the seven million citizens and consumers in Massachusetts but untold tens of millions more living in states with nearly identical consumer protection laws,\" Muffett said.\n\nStates with similar consumer protection laws to Massachusetts\u2014ones that are based on the Federal Trade Commission Act\u2014include California, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Ohio, Vermont, and Washington. There are additional states with laws modeled on the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Acts legislation but whose provisions share similar strengths to Massachusetts' law, Muffett explained, such as Illinois and New Jersey, as well as Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd as the Massachusetts attorney general's office lays out online, the impact of Exxon's action on consumers is at the heart of its investigation: \"Specifically, the investigation seeks information regarding whether Exxon may have misled consumers and/or investors with respect to the impact of fossil fuels on climate change, and climate change-driven risks to Exxon's business.\"\n\nWhile each state is unique, many states do often draw on Massachusetts' extensive body of jurisprudence interpreting its consumer protection laws. This makes for \"another aspect of the Massachusetts case that should be of serious concern for Exxon and its investors,\" Muffett said. \"Since the court was interpreting Exxon's standard franchise agreement, it's very likely that its reasoning would be persuasive if Exxon tries the same defense in any other state where that same standard agreement is in use.\"\n\n\"This is another reason,\" he said, \"why I think the significance of the Massachusetts AG's investigation has been grossly underestimated.\"",
    " Title: New Hampshire Primary Results: Trump and Sanders Triumph Over Establishment Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a clear rejection of the political establishment, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders emerged victorious in the New Hampshire Republican and Democratic primaries respectively.\n\nOn the Republican side, Trump secured a significant victory with 34 percent of the vote, leaving John Kasich in second place with 16 percent. Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again,\" has evidently resonated with voters, garnering him a substantial lead.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Sanders edged out Hillary Clinton by 20 percentage points, demonstrating a strong appeal among young voters. Sanders' platform, which includes promises of universal healthcare and free college tuition, has attracted a larger coalition of young voters than the one Barack Obama built in 2008.\n\nThe results of the primary elections suggest a growing disillusionment among American voters towards the political establishment. This disillusionment is not limited to one party, as evidenced by the 42 percent of Americans who now identify as independent, feeling that the two major parties do not represent their values and positions.\n\nTrump and Sanders, two candidates who have been labeled as outsiders, have tapped into this disillusionment, promising to upend the status quo. Trump's controversial stance on illegal immigration and his proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims have been supported by a majority of Republican primary voters, despite causing national controversy.\n\nSanders, a self-proclaimed socialist, has also faced skepticism, but has managed to gain traction among voters who are seeking an honest and trustworthy politician. Sanders' long-standing advocacy for the average American, and his unwavering stance on issues, has resonated with voters who feel betrayed by the political establishment.\n\nThe results of the New Hampshire primary elections underscore a growing dissatisfaction among American voters. Honesty and trustworthiness appear to be more important to voters than experience or the ability to win in November. The American electorate is in revolt, seeking political leaders who can deliver on their desires for change.\n\nWhile the path to the nomination for Trump and Sanders may not be clear-cut, one thing is certain: Americans have spoken, and they are done with business as usual.",
    " Title: Fox Business Debate in Charleston: A Night of Political Pugilism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Fox Business debate in Charleston, South Carolina, is not marketed as a boxing match, but by the end of the evening, it may be difficult to distinguish the two. The debate, set to take place on Thursday, promises a night of intense political exchanges, with each candidate vying for a chance to emerge victorious.\n\nThe stakes are high for the participating candidates, as they seek to establish themselves as the alternative to frontrunners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, and Jeb Bush are all eager to solidify their positions as the establishment choice, and a poor showing in the upcoming Iowa and New Hampshire primaries could prove detrimental to their campaigns.\n\nIn the last debate, moderators Neil Cavuto and Maria Bartiromo are expected to ask civil and substantive questions, as they aim to elicit important information from the candidates. Both anchors have emphasized that the debates are not about them, but about the candidates and the issues at hand.\n\nHowever, the candidates themselves are likely to engage in a series of verbal sparring matches. Rubio, Christie, and Bush will undoubtedly take aim at each other, as they jockey for position in the race for the Republican nomination.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz, who previously tangled with Rubio over immigration and surveillance, will also be in the mix. Cruz has begun to question Trump's \"New York values,\" and it is possible that he may take a jab or two at the real estate mogul. However, it is more likely that Cruz will focus his attacks on Rubio and the other candidates.\n\nDonald Trump, if history is any guide, will likely hang back and engage in counterpunching. With Iowa polls showing him either slightly ahead of Cruz or running neck and neck, Trump may mention Canada once or twice.\n\nFor the middle-tier candidates, there is no room for holding back. Bush, Christie, and Rubio have a significant investment in a strong New Hampshire finish. The last Fox Business debate was unusually polite due to the fallout from the CNBC debate, where many candidates were outraged by the moderators' perceived condescension and opinionated questions.\n\nHowever, the 2016 race is in a different phase now, and these debates have become winnowing events like never before. The debates dominate the media coverage for as much as a week, with key sound bites endlessly replayed and pundits offering their analyses of the winners and losers. Good debaters such as Rubio, Cruz, and Christie have benefited from this media attention, while poor performances have hurt candidates like Bush.\n\nThe Charleston debate, along with the upcoming debate in Des Moines later this month, looms large for some of the contenders. Some candidates could emerge badly bruised - or worse. Rand Paul is loudly denouncing the decision to knock him off the main stage and refusing to attend the undercard debate. Network criteria can deflate candidates by keeping them out of prime time, and time is running short. These debates have a magnified impact, as they dominate the media coverage and shape public opinion. The Charleston debate will be no exception.",
    " Title: NFL Teams Show Solidarity with Protesting Players, Defy Trump's Call for Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a show of unity, NFL teams across the country and in London displayed a collective response to President Donald Trump's criticism of players who kneel during the U.S. national anthem, as a symbol of protest against perceived racial injustice.\n\nOn Sunday, coaches, support staff, and even some owners joined their team members in various displays of solidarity, such as kneeling, linking arms, or staying off the field during the anthem. This silent response was initiated last season by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has been a vocal critic of police treatment of African-Americans.\n\nIn Detroit, several members of the Lions knelt while singer Rico Lavelle dropped to one knee and pumped a fist in the air at the end of his performance of the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\" In Philadelphia, city police officers joined with Eagles and New York Giants players and Eagles team owner Jeffrey Lurie to link arms during the anthem.\n\nThe controversy was rekindled by Trump on Friday at an Alabama political rally, where he denounced players who kneel during the anthem as unpatriotic and urged owners to dismiss them. This reprised his reality-show catchphrase, \"You're fired.\"\n\nWhile some Americans are sympathetic to the protesters, others see the refusal to stand as a sign of disrespect for the flag and for members of the military who have sacrificed or died in defending the country.\n\nThe theme could play well with Trump's conservative base at a time when the Republican president is grappling with North Korea's nuclear threats, an investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and a healthcare struggle in Congress.\n\nHowever, Trump's stance appeared to galvanize players, teams, and the league to assert what they see as a right to express their political convictions freely. It also highlighted the deep political rift that Trump's election has exposed across many segments of American society.\n\nNew England Patriots Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Kraft, who has dined with Trump and whom the president considers a friend, criticized Trump on Sunday and defended players' right to protest.\n\n\"I am deeply disappointed by the tone of the comments made by the president on Friday,\" Kraft said in a statement. He said players had a \"right to peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner they feel is most impactful.\"\n\nDespite a strong rebuke of his remarks by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the players' union on Saturday, the president did not back down on Sunday, calling on fans to boycott the league if it would not discipline protesting players.\n\n\"If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Fire or suspend!\"\n\nIn another tweet, Trump, who spent the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, said that the \"league should back\" fans who are upset about the protests.\n\nIn Chicago, Trump's feud was the main topic of conversation at the South Loop Club sports bar.\n\n\"This is a First Amendment issue and the president is supposed to uphold that right,\" said Sam Cunningham, 55, who was watching the Pittsburgh-Chicago game with his wife. \"He should know better than anyone that to fire someone because of their opinion is not right.\"\n\nOne patron at a sports bar in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Trump supporter Tim Kull, 67, said, \"Do it on your time, not when you are wearing that uniform.\"\n\nIn Foxboro, Massachusetts, more than a dozen players and coaches on the Super Bowl champion Patriots knelt or linked arms, including quarterback Tom Brady, whom Trump name-dropped as a friend on the campaign trail. Brady placed one hand on his chest and used the other to link arms with his teammates.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan linked arms with team players in solidarity at the game against the Baltimore Ravens in London's Wembley Stadium. Khan donated $1 million to the Trump inauguration fund.\n\nRobert McNair, chairman of the Houston Texans, said Trump's comments were \"divisive and counterproductive to what our country needs right now.\" McNair also donated $1 million to Trump.\n\nOther teams decided to stay off the field during the anthem. Before the Seattle Seahawks game against the Tennessee Titans in Nashville, neither team came out until after the pre-game ceremony.\n\nExcept for a single player, the Pittsburgh Steelers remained off the field in Chicago before their game against the Bears to avoid \"playing politics,\" head coach Mike Tomlin said. The team was roundly booed by the home crowd when it finally emerged.\n\nThe demonstrations along the sidelines ahead of Sunday's early game triggered a fresh round of tweets by the president.\n\n\"Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!\" he wrote.\n\nNational Basketball Association players also struck back against comments by the president on Saturday after Trump clashed with one of the biggest stars in the league, Stephen Curry.\n\nThen on Saturday evening, Oakland A's rookie Bruce Maxwell became the first Major League Baseball player to kneel for the national anthem in protest.\n\nIn a Twitter message, Trump rescinded a White House invitation to Curry, who had said he would \"vote\" against the planned visit by the NBA champion Golden State Warriors.\n\nCurry told a news conference in Oakland, California: \"It's beneath the leader of a country to go that route.\"\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Trump said the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team, which won the Stanley Cup, accepted his invitation to the White House. \"Great team!\" he wrote.",

We were holding up aid at the same time for, what was it, the Northern Triangle countries. We were holding up aid at the Northern Triangle countries so that they would change their policies on immigration.\"\n\nHe further clarified, \"Elections have consequences, and foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.\"\n\nThe statement from Mulvaney comes after a series of investigations into the administration's dealings with Ukraine, which has been a focus of impeachment inquiries in the House of Representatives.",
    " Title: Federal Judiciary Faces Funding Crisis as Shutdown Drains Court Resources\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States federal judiciary is facing a critical funding crisis as a result of the ongoing government shutdown and years of budget austerity measures. The situation has led to a surge of anger and frustration from federal judges, who are now directing their ire towards Congress for the chaos and hardships imposed on the judiciary.\n\nDriving the judges' ire is the budget austerity and the chaos lawmakers have imposed on the judiciary. The judiciary has already been cut to the bone by sequestration, and the government shutdown has added to the problem, leaving the government's third branch running on fumes that may not last out the week.\n\nIn a blog post last week, Senior U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf, a George H.W. Bush appointee who sits in Lincoln, Nebraska, urged his fellow judges to designate all their staff as essential and exempt from furlough. He questioned why every remaining employee of every federal district court, including federal public defenders, should not be declared 'essential' to keep the judiciary functioning during the shutdown.\n\nWhen lawyers for the House urged Judge Amy Berman Jackson to keep a case demanding Operation Fast and Furious-related records from Attorney General Eric Holder moving forward during the shutdown, the judge said lawmakers could cool their heels, just like others with claims pending against the government.\n\nEven before the shutdown, the judiciary shed nearly 2,700 support staff positions over the past two years. Funding for drug testing and electronic monitoring of pre-trial detainees had also been slashed by 20 percent, and federal defenders were under orders to take about 15 days of unpaid furlough in the past year.\n\nThe cuts have caused delays in criminal and civil cases. Even the posting of judges' orders has slowed, with many federal court clerk's offices looking largely empty compared with a few years ago.\n\nSequestration cut $350 million, or about 5 percent, from the judiciary's budget in the past fiscal year, bringing it to about $6.6 billion annually. Judges themselves are effectively exempt from furlough because the Constitution says their salaries\u2014currently $174,000 for district court judges\u2014cannot be reduced.\n\nFor the past two weeks, the federal courts have essentially operated on fumes, using funds from filing fees and so-called no-year appropriations to pay salaries and keep the lights on. Court budget personnel now predict that money will run out on Thursday or Friday of this week. After that, work deemed essential will continue, but there will be no way to pay employees, contractors, or utilities until Congress passes legislation including temporary or year-long funding.\n\nThe chief judge of the U.S. District Court located just blocks from the Capitol building said that the shutdown's funding lapse, piled on top of two years of tight budgets and staff reductions, has prompted his colleagues' frustration level to rise.\n\n\"I have to say it's fairly high,\" Judge Richard Roberts said in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 Friday. \"Court budgets have essentially been slashed to the bone, with us losing nationwide thousands of judicial employees performing very important tasks...We're being told to furlough where we're already cut to the bone.\"\n\nBack on Capitol Hill, earlier complaints had drawn some skepticism. At a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing in July, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) suggested some of sequestration's impacts on the courts were being exaggerated.\n\n\"Congress voted and [the] American people seem quite comfortable with the idea that we can reduce spending for a little while around here instead of having steady growth and they're not panicked,\" Sessions said. \"I know we have stories that there's not enough copy paper in a clerk's office somewhere. Well, I would say...you need a new clerk. It's like those school people that would require the students to bring in toilet paper because they can't find enough money to do that, or fix their roof. That's a mismanagement to me.\"\n\nSessions acknowledged that the sequester did force some cuts more abruptly than made sense, particularly to federal public defender services. Now, with the shutdown taking its own toll on the system, House Judiciary Committee Democrats staged a forum on Capitol Hill last week to draw attention to what they portrayed as a crisis in funding for the courts.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, called the impact of the cuts and the shutdown on the courts \"grave and growing each day.\"",
    " Title: \"Cross-State Insurance Sales and Tort Reform: Add-Ons to Trumpcare Face Skepticism and Challenges\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to garner support for the American Health Care Act, also known as Trumpcare, House Speaker Paul Ryan is considering attaching a companion bill to the main legislation. This secondary bill aims to ease cross-state sales of health insurance and limit jury awards for pain and suffering in malpractice lawsuits.\n\nThe move is an attempt to soften the blow of the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) dismal score on the initial bill, which rolled back key parts of the Affordable Care Act and limited federal spending on Medicaid for low-income individuals. However, the CBO's inability to evaluate these additional prongs due to their lack of written documentation has led to skepticism, with some calling it \"mythical legislation\" and others suggesting \"Easter basket\" might be a more fitting description.\n\nWhile the cross-state sale of insurance is theoretically possible, it is not a significant factor in improving healthcare markets. The decision to allow insurers to operate across state lines is left to individual states and their insurance regulators. The same applies to the second piece, tort reform, which has long been a Republican priority due to the belief that malpractice lawyers are predominantly Democrats. However, the impact of these reforms on insurance costs for the general public remains uncertain.\n\nThe primary challenge for Ryan lies in the fact that the sidecar bill, as it is known in Congress-speak, would require 60 votes to pass in the Senate, as it is not directly related to the budget and cannot be pushed through under budget reconciliation like the initial bill. Furthermore, it is unlikely to secure eight Democratic votes, given its association with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump is reportedly courting conservatives with a \"manager's amendment\" to accompany the first prong, which could potentially end Medicaid sooner, making it more difficult to maintain the support of all Republican senators for the 51 votes needed.\n\nCritics argue that TrumpCare, with its tax cuts for the wealthy, elimination of Medicaid expansion for the poor, and defunding of Planned Parenthood, is a significant step backward in healthcare policy. If you are concerned about these changes, you can contact your Senators by calling the Capitol Hill switchboard at (202) 224-3121.",
    " Title: Senate's Bipartisan Deliberation Under Scrutiny as Partisanship Intensifies\n\nThe United States Senate, traditionally known for its cool and deliberative nature, is facing criticism for its increasingly partisan atmosphere, as demonstrated by the recent silencing of Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) during a debate on the confirmation of Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions (R-AL).\n\nOn Tuesday, Warren was silenced after she read a 1986 letter by civil rights leader Coretta Scott King that expressed strong opposition to Sessions' nomination for a federal judgeship due to his record on civil rights issues. The incident, which has since gone viral on social media under the hashtags #LetLizSpeak and #ShePersisted, has sparked concerns about the Senate's character as a chamber of reasoned, civil deliberation.\n\nSenate Rule 19, a rarely invoked rule, forbids a senator from impugning the motives of another senator or referring to them offensively. Warren was warned about breaking this rule, but continued to read the letter. She was later silenced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who cited her quoting of Mrs. King's statement that \"Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) vigorously defended Warren on the Senate floor on Wednesday, while Senator Tim Scott (R-SC), the Senate's only African-American Republican, gave an impassioned defense of Sessions.\n\nPolitical scientists and historians have expressed concern about the deepening partisanship in the Senate, with some suggesting that it is being exacerbated by the tone of the Trump presidency. Amy Black, a political scientist at Wheaton College in Illinois, stated, \"Given the tone of the Trump campaign and the Trump presidency so far, the Senate has the opportunity to take the political high road and model respectful partisan differences... But that opportunity is being missed.\"\n\nJulian Zelizer, a political historian at Princeton University in New Jersey, noted that the deep partisanship incentivizes both parties to play hardball. \"There is no cooling function left in the Senate,\" he said.\n\nSenators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bob Corker (R-TN) expressed concern about the level of political discourse in the country and the Senate, while others, such as Senator Corker, downplayed the Warren-Sessions flap as a \"blip on the radar screen.\"\n\nAs the Senate continues to navigate contentious debates on health care, taxes, and the confirmation of cabinet nominees, the question remains whether the chamber can return to its traditional role as a place of cooler heads and bipartisan deals.",
    " Title: House Select Committee on Benghazi Continues Investigation, Plans Public Hearings\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Select Committee, established to investigate the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, has recently held closed-door meetings with the State and Justice departments, with plans to conduct public hearings, according to Rep. Trey Gowdy, the committee's chairman.\n\nIn a statement, Gowdy revealed that the Department of State provided new information to the committee and addressed questions raised by its members. The committee is currently focusing on obtaining first-hand accounts from individuals who were present during the attack. Gowdy emphasized that this process will be ongoing and that some aspects of the investigation must remain classified.\n\nThe committee also met with the Justice Department regarding document production and potential witnesses, Gowdy added. Although the select committee has already held two public hearings, Gowdy indicated that more would be held, with most of the work being done in classified settings.\n\nLast week, the GOP-controlled House reauthorized the committee, a move that was met with protest from Democrats on the panel, who expressed concern about the committee's purpose and the lack of clarity regarding new questions the committee aims to answer.\n\nIn a statement, the five Democrats on the committee called for rules that would ensure their full participation in the investigation. They stated, \"Since our members were denied the ability to meaningfully debate or amend the resolution, we now look to the committee to quickly adopt rules that ensure that our Democratic members are able to participate fully in the investigation.\"\n\nA report from the House Intelligence Committee released last year largely cleared the CIA of wrongdoing in the lead-up to the attack, which resulted in the loss of four American lives, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens. However, the report did note that the agency should have more quickly changed its talking points on the impetus for the attack.\n\nAt the select committee's second public hearing in December, Gowdy expressed his commitment to continuing the investigation, stating, \"I am keenly aware that there are people on both sides of the aisle who have concluded all questions have been answered. But, citing a lack of complete understanding on issues like the security environment, I pledged to keep asking questions, saying I would rather ask a question twice than risk not answering it at all.\"\n\nThe 2012 attack has been a contentious political issue between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans, with many Republicans, including potential 2016 presidential candidates, criticizing former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton for the State Department's response to the attack. The issue is expected to play a role in the 2024 presidential race if Clinton decides to run.",
    " Title: \"Comey's Rationale in Clinton Email Investigation Sparks Legal Perplexity\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the declaration by James Comey, the former Director of the FBI, that Hillary Clinton was \"extremely careless\" in her handling of classified information on her private email server while serving as Secretary of State has sparked a wave of confusion and debate among legal professionals across the nation.\n\nThe statement, \"extremely careless,\" carries significant weight in the law, as it aligns with the definition of \"gross negligence\" in the relevant federal criminal statute (18 U.S.C. section 793-f). This statute states that anyone entrusted with national defense documents who, through gross negligence, permits them to be removed from their proper place of custody, can be fined or imprisoned for up to ten years.\n\nHowever, Comey, a former U.S. Attorney, appears to have demonstrated an apparent ignorance of the law. He presented a case of gross negligence, a criminal offense, and defined it as \"extremely careless,\" only to then disregard the law by not recommending criminal prosecution.\n\nThe key phrase is \"gross negligence.\" This term is well-defined in legal circles, with standard jury instructions and legal treatises providing clear definitions. For instance, Black's Law Dictionary, a legal bible for attorneys, describes gross negligence as extreme carelessness. Similarly, a layman's contemporary resource like Wikipedia defines gross negligence as \"serious carelessness.\"\n\nGiven that Comey, by his own words, seems to have established a case of gross negligence, the question arises: how could he then decide against recommending criminal prosecution? This reasoning and conclusion appear to be illogical.\n\nAs a lawyer with 36 years of experience, I have never witnessed such an illogical rationale and conclusion. This incident raises questions about the basis for Comey's decision and the understanding of the law he exhibited during the investigation.",
    " Title: Faith in Action Hosts National Faith Forum, Engages Presidential Candidates on Key Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 The Rev. Alvin Herring, executive director of Faith in Action, a multiracial and multifaith community organizing network, emphasized the importance of dialogue and understanding in his organization's mission. This was evident during the National Faith Forum in Las Vegas this week, where the Rev. Herring facilitated discussions with top presidential candidates, Pete Buttigieg and Tom Steyer.\n\nDuring their presentations, the candidates were given five minutes to introduce themselves before the floor was opened for questions and story-sharing from the audience of around 300 faith-based community organizers. The audience members, hailing from various parts of the country, shared personal experiences related to racial and economic equality, criminal justice reform, immigration, and gun violence.\n\nBoth Steyer and Buttigieg often connected their responses to moral teachings, expressing their support for Faith in Action's goal of building a more just society. Steyer, who has made fighting climate change a key aspect of his presidential campaign, drew inspiration from Pope Francis in his advocacy work. Buttigieg, who spoke to conference participants via video from the campaign trail in California, often referenced his friendships with members of underserved communities when discussing his desire to bring about systemic change.\n\nWhen asked about his stance on deportation, Buttigieg did not commit to ending the practice but promised to be more respectful of immigrants and their loved ones. Steyer, on the other hand, emphasized the need to bring those most affected by climate change, gun violence, or immigration policies into the conversation about how to address these issues.\n\nThe candidate presentations were just a small part of the three-day National Faith Forum, which focused primarily on training faith-based community organizers and strengthening relationships between Faith in Action organizations in different states. The forum also included presentations on increasing census participation, improving advocacy campaigns, and getting out the vote for the 2020 election.\n\nThe brief conversations with Buttigieg and Steyer were crucial to Faith in Action's goal of getting policymakers to pay more attention to the concerns of multiracial religious communities, according to the Rev. Herring. He emphasized that every important conversation should involve people of faith, and that faith-based coalitions like Faith in Action can provide guidance to whoever is elected in November as they seek to improve the country's policies.\n\nAfter each candidate spoke, the Rev. Herring invited them to take part in a prayer, emphasizing the significance of the 2020 election and the role religious communities can and should play in it. The Rev. Herring prayed for the candidates, asking God to guide them during their campaigns and to remind them of the nation's watching eyes and the listening ears of faith-based communities who believe in justice.",
    " Title: Oklahoma Court Orders Johnson & Johnson to Pay $572 Million in Opioid Epidemic Case\n\nAn Oklahoma judge has ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million in damages for its role in the state's opioid epidemic. The landmark ruling, delivered on Monday, marks the first trial verdict in over 1,500 lawsuits consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio.\n\nThe ruling was a response to a $17 billion lawsuit filed by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, who accused the pharmaceutical giant of deceptively marketing painkillers and flooding the market with the deadly drugs. The litigation was closely watched by plaintiffs in similar lawsuits, with a federal trial set for October.\n\nCleveland County District Court Judge Thad Balkman stated, \"The opioid crisis has ravaged the state of Oklahoma. It must be abated immediately.\" The state sued J&J in an effort to address the crisis with addiction treatment and prevention programs. More than 4,000 people died of opioid overdoses in Oklahoma between 2007 and 2017, according to lawyers.\n\nDuring the non-jury trial, Hunter accused J&J of being a \"kingpin\" company motivated by greed. He claimed the corporation's years-long, aggressive marketing campaign had caused a public nuisance, with doctors over-prescribing the drugs, leading to a surge in overdose deaths.\n\nTwo of J&J's subsidiaries, Noramco and Tasmanian Alkaloids, have produced a significant amount of the raw opium used by other drug manufacturers to make the painkillers, the state said.\n\nLawyers for the company maintained that it is part of an industry regulated by the federal government, and that painkillers are important in addressing the health needs of Oklahoma residents.\n\nFollowing the decision, J&J's shares rose 5 percent in extended trading. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that opioids were involved in nearly 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017.",
    " Title: The Impact of Economic Conditions on Fast-Food Industry: A Look at Iconic Menu Items and the Rise of the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the dynamic world of fast-food, the success of a new menu item can often serve as a barometer of the overall economic climate. This is evident in the recent surge of popularity for Popeyes' new chicken sandwich, which has been hailed as a symbol of America's current economic strength.\n\nThe sandwich, priced at $3.99, is slightly more expensive than its closest competitor, Chick-fil-A's sandwich, but its popularity seems to indicate that consumers are willing to pay a premium for a unique dining experience. The sandwich's success has been so significant that restaurants are reportedly selling out of ingredients.\n\nThe fast-food industry is known for its responsiveness to consumer tastes and budgets. In tough economic times, fast-food companies do not have to worry about rising food or labor costs as much, as their customers are on a tighter budget. However, in good economic times, consumers are still looking for value, but fast-food companies face the challenge of managing rising food and labor costs, which can squeeze their profit margins.\n\nRaising prices on existing menu items can help maintain profit margins, but going too far may lead to consumer backlash. An alternative strategy is to introduce new product offerings at higher prices to attract existing or new customers. This \"inflation\" strategy is not new in the fast-food industry.\n\nIconic burgers such as Burger King's Whopper and McDonald's Big Mac were both introduced during periods of low unemployment, similar to the current economic climate. The Whopper was first introduced in 1957, during a year when the unemployment rate dropped as low as 3.7%. The Big Mac, on the other hand, was born in 1967, with the national unemployment rate also below 4%.\n\nThe fast-food industry has also faced criticism for its role in the obesity crisis, particularly in the late 1990s when the industry introduced super-sized portions in response to consumer demand. This trend, which coincided with a growing obesity crisis, was met with public outcry following the release of the documentary \"Super Size Me,\" leading to the phasing out of super-sized portions by McDonald's in 2004.\n\nIn the current economic climate, the fast-food industry is once again turning to new product offerings to drive profits. Before the Popeyes chicken sandwich, there were splashy announcements from the industry about menu items featuring plant-based meat alternatives such as Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods. These products, while marketed as health-conscious, are not cheap, adding a premium to the cost of these menu items.\n\nThe Popeyes chicken sandwich is not trying to be bigger or cheaper; instead, it aims to offer a better chicken sandwich experience with a brioche bun, a full layer of pickles, and either a spicy Cajun spread or mayonnaise. While the nearest Chick-fil-A to some locations sells its chicken sandwich for $3.49, the Popeyes sandwich is 14% higher at $3.99.\n\nAs the economy's good times cannot last forever, the fast-food industry may continue to innovate and introduce new menu items to maintain profitability. The Whopper, the Big Mac, the Six Dollar Burger, and now the Impossible Burger and the Popeyes chicken sandwich are testaments to the industry's ability to adapt to changing economic conditions and consumer preferences.",
    " Title: South Bend Council Member Oliver Davis Endorses Joe Biden Over Pete Buttigieg in 2020 Presidential Race\n\nA South Bend, Indiana city council member, Oliver Davis, has endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential race, according to a statement from Biden's campaign. Davis, a Black leader, has joined the growing list of national, state, and local figures supporting Biden's candidacy.\n\nIn the statement, Davis expressed his support for Biden, stating, \"In times like these, when the political winds are fiercely blowing across our country, it's important for us to have an experienced leader who has been through the diverse storms of life to guide our country.\" He further added, \"That's why I am very pleased to support Vice President Joe Biden to be our next President of the United States of America.\"\n\nBiden's campaign noted that the former vice president has received support from over 600 national, state, and local leaders across the country. Davis is the third African American elected official from Indiana to endorse Biden.\n\nThe endorsement comes as Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, has seen a surge in momentum, particularly in the early caucus state of Iowa. However, Buttigieg has faced challenges in gaining support from black voters. Davis told Politico that Buttigieg's inability to gain support from communities of color \"is not a new problem for him.\"\n\nDavis ran to replace Buttigieg as South Bend's mayor this year but lost in the Democratic primary to Buttigieg's preferred candidate, James Mueller. The endorsement marks a significant development in the 2020 Democratic race, as candidates continue to vie for support from diverse communities.",
    " Title: Investigations into Trump-Russia Collusion and Obama-era Wiretapping Allegations: A Maze of Conspiracy Theories and Lack of Evidence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of Washington's periodic conspiracy frenzies, the United States finds itself embroiled in two major investigations, both involving allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence, and the Obama administration's wiretapping of Trump Tower. However, as of today, there is no concrete evidence to support either charge.\n\nThe first allegation, centered on the Trump campaign's collusion with Russian intelligence, has been a point of contention due to the discrepancies in statements made by former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions regarding their contacts with Russian officials. The inconsistencies have led to suspicions of concealment, but there is no inherent wrongdoing in either behavior.\n\nThe second storyline, the Obama-wiretap accusation, has been uniformly dismissed by Congressional Republicans, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, and no member of Trump's administration has publicly endorsed it as true. The wiretap story is considered less plausible than a zombie invasion, yet some have spun a milder, more plausible scenario of executive abuse.\n\nThe Obama administration's alleged abuse of the right to listen in on foreigners as a means to improperly monitor Americans is a matter of concern. If the agencies did so, the truth will eventually come to light. For now, both investigations are akin to a rabbit hole, consuming vast amounts of heat and energy, potentially leading us back to where we started.\n\nAs the nation grapples with these internal conflicts, external challenges persist. North Korea continues to test missiles in preparation for attacking U.S. bases in Japan, and the installation of an anti-missile shield in South Korea is imminent. The nation must remain vigilant and prepared, lest it becomes distracted, spent, and unprepared when the real crises hit. The investigations' heat and energy should not divert attention from the pressing national agenda and the looming threats beyond the capital's cozy confines.",
    " Title: Repurposed Drugs Show Promise in Cancer Treatment: Study Identifies Dozens of New Cancer-Killing Compounds\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in Nature Cancer has revealed that drugs originally developed to treat diseases such as diabetes and alcoholism may have applications in cancer treatment. Researchers, led by Steven Corsello of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, tested thousands of existing medications against hundreds of human cancer cell lines in the lab. The study identified dozens of newly identified cancer-killing compounds.\n\nCorsello, an oncologist, emphasizes the need for improved and better-tailored cancer therapy. He notes that new drug development is costly and time-consuming, often requiring years of research, and potential treatments rarely progress beyond the lab. Even when a medication makes it to clinical trials, it must undergo years of safety testing, and many of those that kill cancer efficiently are so toxic to test subjects that they are never approved.\n\nThe field of repurposing existing drugs is gaining traction, according to Jonathan Sexton, a medicinal chemist who directs the University of Michigan's Center for Drug Repurposing and was not involved in the study. Sexton explains that the field is \"notoriously very bad at predicting what [compounds] are going to be most efficacious against specific cancers,\" which is why there is a high attrition rate in clinical trials for cancer drugs. This situation has produced a wealth of medications that may not work for one type of cancer but could work for another type.\n\nAt the Broad Institute, Corsello and his colleagues investigate how drugs affect gene expression to determine whether the compounds have potential applications in cancer treatment. They developed a library of more than 1.5 million gene expression profiles from thousands of potential drug molecules, called the Connectivity Map, to guide the search. Corsello realized that the library was missing many drugs, including those that the FDA has already approved for other uses. With that in mind, he and his colleagues at the Broad Institute launched the Drug Repurposing Hub (DRH) in 2017 to test existing drugs against various disease models. The open-access library, which researchers anywhere can use for free, now includes more than 6,000 drugs, ranging from aspirin to Zantac.\n\nRong Xu, a medical bioinformaticist at Case Western Reserve University, who was not involved in the study, says that libraries such as the DRH are invaluable for \"dry\" labs that use computer-generated models to investigate new drug applications. Xu explains that they will use the data from the DRH to design computer algorithms that can identify potential treatment avenues.\n\nIn the new study, Corsello and his colleagues systematically tested 4,518 compounds from the DRH against 578 cancer cell lines. Most were developed to treat diseases other than cancer; about a quarter were originally developed for cancer. Using a molecular bar-coding method, the researchers were able to test multiple cancer cell types simultaneously in each Petri dish, speeding the process considerably. In total, the team identified nearly 50 compounds that killed cancer cells and left other cells unscathed.\n\nThe researchers found 11 different drugs that trigger the same cancer-killing mechanism. These included one previously approved to treat essential thrombocytosis\u2014a blood disorder\u2014as well as progesterone medications. The drugs all appear to work by inducing an interaction between two proteins: PDE3A, which plays a role in regulating blood pressure, and SLFN12, whose role is not well understood. Corsello says the interaction is \"an attractive target\" for developing new therapies.\n\nOnce a drug shows selective anticancer effects, the next step is to find out how it works. Corsello explains that the team does so by looking at \"everything that's known\" about the cancer cell lines the drug kills. He lists a battery of genomic features the researchers analyze to determine where and how the killing blow lands, including gene expression, mutation, and the number of copies of the gene in the genotype. \"Then, using predictive modeling approaches, [we] determine predictive biomarkers of response to each of these therapies,\" he says.\n\nOf course, not all of these medications will turn out to work against cancer in humans. Predictive biomarkers can indicate how effective a treatment will be against a particular type of cancer cell line in the lab or how well it can treat a patient in the clinic. \"We prioritized drugs for follow-up that had selective [anticancer] activity and drugs that had predictive biomarkers from these cell line features,\" Corsello says. Medications that can predictably kill certain cancer cells could eventually be tested in patients and predict individuals who could benefit from those treatments.\n\nCorsello says that the research team plans to add 300 new cancer cell lines and 300 drug compounds to the library. \"I think there's still a lot that remains to be learned and discovered from this data,\" Corsello says. By using technologies such as CRISPR gene editing and screening, \"we're able to take a drug with promising activity and actually figuring out how it's working, which I think is a really promising strategy for the future that may have an impact on drug development.\"",
    " Title: The Onion's Satirical Take on Mass Shootings in America: A Reflection of Reality and Public Discourse\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of yet another mass shooting, a satirical news site, The Onion, has once again republished its poignant article, \" 'No Way To Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.\" The piece, which has been shared thousands of times on social media, highlights the recurring nature of mass shootings in the United States and the nation's seeming inability to prevent such tragedies.\n\nThe article, first published in 2013, has been repackaged three times over the last five years, with the facts and dates of the specific shooting updated each time. The core message, however, remains consistent: that the United States, the only economically advanced nation where roughly two mass shootings occur every month for the past five years, is a place where mass killings are a regular occurrence.\n\nThe article's latest iteration was published this week following a shooting at an Oregon community college that left nine people dead. The key lines read:\n\n... citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded... that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place.\n\n\"This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there's nothing anyone can do to stop them,\" said a resident, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world's deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations.\n\nAt press time, residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past five years were referring to themselves and their situation as \"helpless.\"\n\nThe article's resonance on social media has not gone unnoticed, with some Twitter users praising The Onion for its powerful and insightful commentary on the issue. Katie Reeves, a Twitter user, commented, \"This is peculiarly powerful: The Onion simply re-posts its gun violence article with updated locations and dates.\" Drew Thaler, another Twitter user, said, \"This is how you make a point. Three different articles from The Onion.\"\n\nDave Cullen, a journalist who has covered mass shootings for years and wrote the New York Times bestseller Columbine, praised The Onion's article, stating, \"I think what [the article's popularity] says is we look for the people who tell us the truth\u2014kind of the emperor's new clothes\u2014who see through the stuff, and do not just print the same old stuff, or do the same old stuff, or do the safe stuff\u2014the people who call us on our s**t.\"\n\nCullen further explained that The Onion's article resonates because it \"completely nails it.\" He added, \"That [the article] resonates because they totally got it.\"\n\nCullen also noted that The Onion's satirical coverage of mass shootings in America has not always been well-received. After a shooting that killed 12 at Washington Navy Yard in 2013, The Onion published a story with the headline: \"Location of Newest Mass Shooting Revealed. It's A Navy Yard, Authorities Confirm.\" The response on social media was mixed, with some finding the piece in poor taste, while others found it to be a valid commentary on the issue.\n\nIn some cases, there is no satire to praise or ridicule at all. After the Charleston church massacre, Jon Stewart, instead of delivering a biting, satirical monologue on The Daily Show, started his comments after the shooting with the words, \"I've got nothing.\" The Onion, after the Sandy Hook massacre, wrote an article with the headline, \"F**k Everything, Nation Reports.\"\n\nThe Onion's satirical take on mass shootings in America has sparked a conversation about the role of satire in public discourse and the limits of humor in the face of tragedy. While some find The Onion's approach to be a powerful and insightful commentary on the issue, others find it to be in poor taste or inappropriate. Regardless of one's perspective, The Onion's satirical coverage of mass shootings in America has undoubtedly left a lasting impact on the national conversation about gun violence and its prevalence in the United States.",
    " Title: Iowa Campaign Trail: Trump and Clinton Hold Divergent Rallies in Oskaloosa and Madison County\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heartland of Iowa, two presidential hopefuls, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, held contrasting campaign events on Saturday, attracting vastly different crowds and delivering distinct messages.\n\nAt Oskaloosa High School, Trump, in his signature freewheeling style, targeted Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, labeling his state a \"disaster\" and criticizing Walker's fiscal policies. Trump regaled the crowd with anecdotes from his recent border tour in Texas, where he showcased his hardline stance on immigration. He spent much of his time lamenting the state of the country while boasting about his business acumen.\n\n\"Who can do better than Trump?\" Trump asked the crowd. \"I fix things.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Madison County, Clinton held a more intimate gathering with less than 100 Third District Iowa Democrats. Under a sycamore tree, Clinton, eschewing her trademark pantsuit for a more casual outfit, reminisced about her years campaigning outdoors with her husband, former President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"It's very nostalgic,\" Clinton said. \"I spent all those years with Bill in Arkansas and we used to campaign under trees from one part of the state to another. We were outdoors all the time. We were in cattle barns, rodeos, wherever two or more gathered. We had so much fun. It was harder to do that in a national campaign, but it's easier in Iowa than anywhere else. That's why being here with you is so meaningful to me.\"\n\nTrump's rally, characterized by a free catered barbecue and a celebratory atmosphere, attracted families, with attendees encouraged to take home any leftover food. Clinton's event, by contrast, was a more subdued affair, with Clinton delivering a policy-heavy stump speech, touching on topics such as early-childhood education, the Affordable Care Act, gay rights, and elder care.\n\nTrump and Clinton each addressed issues such as immigration, veterans, and trade, with Trump focusing on his plans for border security and his criticism of the current administration's negotiating skills, and Clinton emphasizing her opposition to big money in politics and her support for various social causes.\n\nTrump also highlighted his relationship with veterans, presenting a stack of letters allegedly written by veterans in the past day. Clinton, in her speech, did not mention her primary opponents, despite former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley serenading the crowd with songs, including a rendition of \"This Land Is Your Land.\"\n\nAs the campaign season heats up, both candidates continue to make their case to Iowa voters, with Trump trailing in recent polls despite his brash and often controversial rhetoric.",
    " Title: CNN's Bill Mears Predicts Narrow Survival of Individual Mandate in Supreme Court's Health Care Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview, CNN's Bill Mears, a seasoned journalist, has been asked repeatedly about the Supreme Court's upcoming decision on the Affordable Care Act. Mears, in his prediction, suggests that the individual mandate, a key provision of the Act, will survive, but in a narrow fashion.\n\nMears believes that Chief Justice John Roberts will write the majority opinion upholding the individual mandate. He notes that the chief justice, when in the majority, has the power to assign the all-important opinion-writing. This opinion, Mears explains, is where the court speaks, deriving its power, institutional prestige, and authority.\n\nThe division on the constitutionality of the individual mandate was evident during the oral arguments, with Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy asking tough questions from both sides. Mears suggests that Roberts' reasoning for either upholding or striking down the mandate may not command a majority, meaning at least five justices agree on the outcome but not the constitutional basis. This split reasoning could lead to further uncertainty if Congress and the White House were to revise or entirely rework health care reform in the wake of the court's decision.\n\nMears suggests that the task of commanding a five-vote majority and keeping it during the contentious opinion-writing process may lead Roberts, or whoever, to think small and narrow. He predicts that the ruling will uphold the mandate by insisting that health care is unique in the national economy and warning Congress not to go much further when regulating \"commerce,\" i.e., no mandate to buy broccoli or American cars.\n\nThe exact outcome remains uncertain, as only the justices, their law clerks, and a handful of court officials know how this will end. However, Mears expects a complex, lengthy, and perhaps baffling ruling or series of rulings.",
    " Title: The Impact of Conservative Economic Policies: A Closer Look at Deregulation and Tax Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent New York Times article, a wave of optimism among American business leaders is highlighted, with the surge in investment in new plants, equipment, and factory upgrades contributing to economic growth and job creation. However, the article challenges the notion that deregulation and tax cuts are the primary drivers of this economic activity.\n\nThe article asserts that there is little historical evidence linking regulation levels to growth, and that the evidence is weak regarding the impact of deregulation or tax cuts on economic activity. This perspective, however, is not without its critics.\n\nMany economists argue that lowering the cost of doing business through deregulation and tax cuts can indeed stimulate economic activity. While it is true that the Trump administration has not entirely eliminated existing regulations, it has halted numerous Obama-era regulations from being enacted and prevented thousands of yet-to-be-implemented regulations from being considered.\n\nMoreover, the article's assertion that econ reporters at major publications have spent the past decade propping up economists who focus on issues like inequality, labor unions, and climate change, rather than economic growth, is a point of contention. This perspective suggests that the media has been biased in favor of liberal policy positions, presenting their arguments as scientifically sound, while ignoring the free-market arguments of many economists.\n\nOne contentious issue that highlights this bias is the push for a $15 minimum wage. Studies have shown that cities that have implemented this policy have experienced job losses. For instance, researchers at the University of Washington found that Seattle's $15 minimum-wage hike led to thousands of fewer jobs and thousands of people losing hours of work, resulting in lower incomes.\n\nWhile it is essential to acknowledge the complexities and uncertainties inherent in economic forecasting, the media's reliance on certain economists to validate liberal policy positions has led to a lack of discussion about the trade-offs of regulations. For example, increasing the minimum wage raises the price of labor, which can lead to reduced employment.\n\nIn contrast, the media's portrayal of the impact of deregulation and tax cuts on the economy is often oversimplified or ignored. The recent corporate tax cuts, for instance, have led to numerous companies announcing bonus checks for their workers, demonstrating the tangible benefits of these policies.\n\nIn conclusion, while deregulation and tax cuts are not a panacea for the economy, they can play a significant role in stimulating economic growth and job creation. It is crucial to consider the evidence from a variety of perspectives, giving voice to the economists who argue for the benefits of free-market policies.",
    " Title: Republican National Convention Shifts Tactics: A Subtle Strategy Aimed at Obama's Disappointment Narrative\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican National Convention in Tampa has concluded, leaving behind a subtle yet significant shift in the GOP's messaging strategy towards President Barack Obama. The watchword of the convention was disappointment, as the Republicans posed as Obama 2008 voters, lamenting his unfulfilled expectations rather than the kitchen-sink attacks that preceded the gathering.\n\nThe Obama campaign team has been spinning the convention as a complete miss, arguing that Republicans didn't land a significant blow on their man. However, the strategy emerging from Tampa is a more dangerous one for Obama, a shift from the direct attacks to a more nuanced approach that subtly undermines Obama's 2008 image and his unfulfilled promises.\n\nRepublican nominee Mitt Romney and Sen. Marco Rubio, in their speeches, emphasized the disappointment theme, highlighting the president's unfulfilled economic, political, and environmental promises. Romney stated, \"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. My promise is to help you and your family.\" Rubio added, \"Our problem with President Obama isn't that he's a bad person... Our problem is that he's a bad president.\"\n\nThe convention also showcased a more inclusive and appealing image, with the introduction of young vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan, who spoke of his mother as his role model and his commitment to protect Medicare for seniors. Cuban-American Sen. Marco Rubio and Mexican-American Gov. Susana Martinez spoke of the opportunities the United States afforded them to rise into leadership positions.\n\nWhile the convention was not without its tough criticism, the shrill hyperbole, petty critiques, and Party of No intransigence were absent, giving the convention a more moderate and appealing tone. The convention's strategy seems to be a calculated move to soften up the opponent and shift momentum, a body blow aimed at subtly undermining Obama's image and his unfulfilled promises. The impact of this strategy will likely become more evident as the campaign progresses, particularly as super PACs and other outside groups intensify their attacks against Obama.",
    " Title: China Imposes Retaliatory Tariffs on U.S. Goods in Response to Trump's Tariff Hikes\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In response to President Donald Trump's decision to raise duties on Chinese goods, China announced Monday it will impose tariffs on more than 5,000 U.S. products, impacting approximately $60 billion in U.S. imports. The tariffs, which will range from 5% to 25%, will take effect on June 1, providing both sides with time to resume trade negotiations that broke off last week without reaching a new deal.\n\nThe U.S. import taxes on $200 billion of Chinese goods increased to 25% on Friday, from 10%, as a result of the Trump administration's tariff hikes. The White House stated that the U.S. will be taking in \"tens of billions of dollars\" from tariffs, although economists argue that these costs will ultimately be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 600 points, or 2.3%, and closed at 25,324, marking its biggest one-day loss since January. The S&P 500 index slipped 2.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has been particularly vulnerable to trade tensions, was down 3.4% at the closing bell.\n\nBoeing's stock plummeted more than 4% after the editor of a state-owned newspaper speculated that China may single out the jet manufacturer for retaliation for Trump's tariffs. The editor, Hu Xijin, of the Global Times, wrote on Twitter, \"China may stop purchasing US agricultural products and energy, reduce Boeing orders, and restrict US service trade with China.\"\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley, a leading Republican critic of Trump's tariffs, expressed his concern on Capitol Hill, stating, \"Raising tariffs will hurt both US & China economies + more importantly will hurt US farmers/consumers/businesses.\"\n\nCailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, expects the U.S. and China to reach a limited trade agreement in the next month or so, but noted that a cooling-off period may be necessary to allow each party to save face before meaningful progress can be made. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and president of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit policy group, stated that the Chinese tariffs are an extension of their previous strategy, and that the ongoing trade war is evidence of an escalating and increasingly troubling situation.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to meet at the annual G-20 gathering of global leaders in Japan this June. Trump has urged China to negotiate seriously and to quit moving the goalpost, while Xi has yet to respond publicly to Trump's calls for a new trade deal.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Senators Introduce Legislation to Protect Special Counsel's Office\n\nA bipartisan group of senators will introduce legislation on Wednesday aimed at protecting the office of the special counsel, following President Donald Trump's comments about potentially firing the special prosecutor investigating Russia and the 2016 election.\n\nRobert Mueller, the special counsel, is currently probing allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, an investigation that has expanded to include whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Russia has denied interfering in the election, and Trump and the White House have maintained there was no collusion.\n\nAfter the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the offices of Trump's personal lawyer on Monday, based partly on a referral by Mueller, Trump described the investigation as \"a disgrace\" and suggested he may consider firing the special counsel.\n\nIn response, four senators announced they would merge two different proposals to protect the office of the special counsel. The original bills were introduced last summer. If passed, the legislation would allow the special counsel to be fired only \"for good cause\" by a senior Justice Department official, with a reason given in writing; provide recourse if the special counsel was fired without good cause; and preserve the staffing and materials of a pending investigation.\n\n\"We need to ensure not only that Special Counsel Mueller can complete his work without interference, but that special counsels in future investigations can, too,\" said Democratic Senator Chris Coons, one of the sponsors of the bill, in a statement.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said that while he thought Mueller should be allowed to continue his probe, he did not think legislation to protect him was necessary. It remains unclear whether the proposal could pass the House or that Trump would approve it.\n\nSpokespeople for McConnell and the White House did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comments. However, Coons said in an interview with MSNBC that he thought some Republicans, who currently have the majority in the Senate, could be swayed to back the bill.\n\n\"I think the events of the past week have changed some minds in the Republican caucus, that there is a moment here for the Senate to stand up and save the president from himself,\" said Coons.",
    " Title: America in 2017: A Reflection of 1968's Tumultuous Times\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States in 2017 appears to be experiencing a resurgence of the language, politics, and global instability reminiscent of 1968. The country is grappling with a divisive political climate, social unrest, and a world abroad that seems to be unraveling.\n\nIn 1968, the United States was embroiled in the Vietnam War, faced a bitter and close presidential election, antiwar protests, racial riots, political assassinations, terrorism, and a looming economic recession. The country managed to avoid a civil war but suffered a collective psychological depression, civil unrest, defeat in Vietnam, and various other disasters for the next decade.\n\nFast forward to 2017, and the United States finds itself in a similar state of division, with the divide being deeper and more geographically dispersed. The two liberal coasts are pitted against red-state America in between, as century-old monuments are torn down, and the old standbys of American life seem to be eroding.\n\nThe NFL is imploding as it devolves into a political circus, with players refusing to stand for the national anthem, turning off millions of fans whose former loyalties paid their salaries. Politics permeates popular culture, with the new allegiance of the media, late-night television, stand-up comedy, Hollywood, professional sports, and universities committed to liberal sermonizing.\n\nThe smears \"racist,\" \"fascist,\" \"white privilege,\" and \"Nazi\" are overused, and there is less free speech on campus than during the McCarthy era of the early 1950s. The European Union, the model of the future, is unraveling, with the exit of Great Britain, the divide between Spain and Catalonia, the bankruptcy of Mediterranean nation members, insidious terrorist attacks in major European cities, and the onslaught of millions of immigrants.\n\nGermany is once again becoming imperious, but this time insidiously by means other than arms. The failed state of North Korea claims that it has nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching America's West Coast, and Iran is likely to follow the North Korea nuclear trajectory.\n\nThe question remains: Is the chaos of 2017 a catharsis, a necessary and long overdue purge of dangerous and neglected pathologies? Or is the crisis too little democracy, as populists strive to dethrone a scandal-plagued, anti-democratic, incompetent, and overrated entrenched elite?\n\nNeither traditional political party has any answers. Democrats are being overwhelmed by the identity politics and socialism of progressives, while Republicans are torn asunder between upstart populist nationalists and the calcified establishment status quo. Yet, for all the social instability and media hysteria, life in the United States quietly seems to be getting better. The economy is growing, unemployment and inflation remain low, the stock market and middle-class incomes are up, business and consumer confidence are high, corporate profits are up, energy production has expanded, and the border with Mexico is being enforced.\n\nIs the instability less a symptom that America is falling apart and more a sign that the loud conventional wisdom of the past\u2014about the benefits of a globalized economy, the insignificance of national borders, and the importance of identity politics\u2014is drawing to a close, along with the careers of those who profited from it? In the past, any crisis that did not destroy the United States ended up making it stronger. But for now, the fight grows over which is more toxic\u2014the chronic statist malady that was eating away the country, or the new populist medicine deemed necessary to cure it.",
    " Title: Investigation Raises Questions About Discussions of 25th Amendment Invocation Within DOJ and FBI\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the release of former Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe's book, a series of revelations have surfaced, suggesting that high-level officials within the Department of Justice (DOJ) discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump from office in 2017. McCabe, who was fired for providing false information to the DOJ, claims that he and other top officials at the FBI and DOJ held discussions about invoking the Constitution's 25th Amendment to declare President Trump unfit for office and install the vice president in his place.\n\nThe 25th Amendment, which provides a means to remove a president who is unable to perform the duties of the office, does not allow law enforcement or government officials to force a president from office. Discussions about how or whether to attempt to exercise the 25th Amendment in this way is indicative of a coup mentality by career bureaucrats.\n\nMcCabe's claims that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was part of this coup attempt are shocking. The deputy attorney general makes innumerable decisions every day that impact a massive number of issues; practically every decision the federal government makes requires his approval if it implicates legal or constitutional issues. That any person in that position would consider wearing a wire to obtain evidence against the sitting president, based upon thin allegations contained in the dossier ex-British spy Christopher Steele produced for the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign, should frighten every American.\n\nThough McCabe's veracity is questionable, it does seem unlikely any serious deputy attorney general would joke about such matters. McCabe claims that he and others believed they were working for a president who might have conspired with Russia to betray this country. However, there must not be one scintilla of evidence of this; otherwise, special counsel Robert Mueller surely would have taken steps long before now to rid the nation of such a dangerous commander-in-chief.\n\nMcCabe and his cabal knew that the entire Russia collusion narrative was bought and paid for by the Clinton campaign. We know McCabe knew this from the congressional testimony of former associate deputy attorney general Bruce Ohr, who swore under oath (and he, unlike McCabe, was not fired for lying) that he told McCabe and others at the FBI that the Steele dossier was being pushed by a Trump-hater and should be relied upon with caution.\n\nBy May 2017, McCabe implies he was in a state of panic on behalf of the gullible nation led by a Russian asset\u2014but as Ohr said, McCabe and his cronies were aware that the explosive claims in the dossier were unverified. How could there be panic about unverified allegations?\n\nAlso by May 2017, the FBI had months and months worth of \"FISA take,\" or data from the electronic spying on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page and all those with whom Page communicated over months, or even years, prior to October 2016 when the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant was signed. According to former FBI director James Comey, none of that data resulted in any verification of the claims in the Steele dossier.\n\nNonetheless, to these government bureaucrats, it was acceptable to lie to the FISA Court by vouching for an unverified dossier. It was acceptable to them to illegally leak to the media the existence of the Russia investigation (for example, leaking the existence of a highly-classified FISA warrant on the Russian ambassador to destroy former national security adviser Michael Flynn and cripple the young presidency). And they apparently thought it acceptable to contemplate the use of the 25th Amendment to remove a president wholly capable of performing his constitutional duties.\n\nFrancey Hakes is a former prosecutor who now consults on national security and the protection of children.

The Dow closed 2,997.10 points lower, or 12.9%, at 20,188.52, with the 30-stock index briefly dipping more than 3,000 points in the final minutes of trading.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 12% to 2,386.13, reaching its lowest level since December 2018, while the Nasdaq Composite closed 12.3% lower at 6,904.59, marking its worst day ever.\n\nFrank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet, commented, \"The markets are getting no break with yesterday's historic Fed actions and COVID-19 dominating the world's headlines. While the news continues to worsen and with the price action doing things we've only seen a handful of other times in the last century, it's nearly impossible to keep things in perspective.\"\n\nThe market's downturn followed President Donald Trump's statement that the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak could last until August.

    " Title: Japan Resumes Commercial Whaling, Defying International Criticism and IWC Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked international controversy, a small fleet of Japanese whaling vessels has embarked on the country's first commercial whale hunt in decades. The hunt is taking place despite criticism from the international community and the withdrawal from the International Whaling Commission (IWC).\n\nThe Japanese government has been granted a permit to catch 227 minke, Bryde's, and sei whales this year, marking a significant departure from the country's previous stance of conducting whaling for research purposes. The fisheries ministry has set a kill cap for the season, with a target of 52 minke, 150 Bryde's, and 25 sei whales.\n\nThe last commercial whale hunt in Japan was in 1986. However, Japan has continued to hunt whales under the guise of research, a practice that has been met with criticism from the international community. The IWC, in an effort to protect whale populations, had agreed to an effective ban on whale hunting, but Japan argues that sustainable whale hunting is possible.\n\nConservationist groups, such as Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd, remain critical of Japan's resumption of whaling. However, they have yet to announce any concrete plans for action against the country.\n\nThe resumption of commercial whaling has been welcomed by the Japanese whalers, who view it as a means of preserving their cultural heritage. Shigeto Hase, the head of the agency, expressed his joy at the resumption of whaling, stating that it would ensure the preservation of the culture and way of life for future generations.\n\nYoshifumi Kai, head of the Japan Small-Type Whaling Association, shared Hase's sentiments, stating that whaling has been a part of his hometown's culture for over 400 years. He expressed his excitement about the resumption of whaling, but also his concern about the declining knowledge of whale cooking and consumption among younger generations.\n\nDespite concerns about the endangerment of certain whale species, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species classifies minke and Bryde's whales as not endangered. Sei whales are classified as endangered, but their numbers are increasing.\n\nThe resumption of commercial whaling marks a significant shift in Japan's approach to whaling, a practice that has been a part of the country's culture for centuries. Whales were brought to the brink of extinction by hunting in the 19th and early 20th Century. The hunting moratorium, agreed upon by all IWC members in 1986, was intended to allow whale numbers to recover.\n\nSince 1987, Japan has killed between 200 and 1,200 whales each year under an exemption to the ban allowing for scientific research. Critics argue that this was a cover for Japan to hunt whales for food, as the meat from the whales killed for research often ended up for sale.\n\nIn 2018, Japan attempted one last time to convince the IWC to allow whaling under sustainable quotas, but failed. As a result, Japan left the IWC, effective from July 2019. The resumption of commercial whaling in Japan signals a new era in the global whaling industry, one that remains contentious and divisive.",
    " Title: Deadliest Day in Gaza Since 2014 War: 52 Palestinians Killed, 2,400 Injured in Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a day marked by escalating violence, at least 52 Palestinians have been killed and 2,400 wounded by Israeli troops, according to Palestinian officials. This makes it the deadliest day since the 2014 Gaza war. The violence erupted on the day the United States opened its embassy in Jerusalem, an event that Palestinians view as clear US backing for Israeli rule over the city's eastern part, which they claim.\n\nThe unrest began six weeks ago with protests at the Gaza border, known as the \"Great March of Return,\" led by Gaza's Islamist rulers, Hamas. The protests reached a climax on Tuesday, the day Palestinians commemorate the Nakba or Catastrophe, marking the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians following the foundation of the Israeli state in 1948.\n\nUS President Donald Trump hailed the embassy move in a video message, stating that it was a \"long time coming.\" He added that Israel is a sovereign nation with the right to determine its own capital, but the US remains \"committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement.\"\n\nThe Israeli military reported that 40,000 Palestinians participated in \"violent riots\" at 13 locations along the Gaza Strip security fence on Monday. Palestinians hurled stones and incendiary devices, while Israeli troops used snipers. Black smoke poured from burning tires, and the health ministry, run by Hamas, reported that children were among those killed.\n\nThe Israeli military stated that it had killed three people attempting to plant explosives near the security fence in Rafah. Aircraft and tanks also targeted military positions belonging to Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip, according to the Israeli military.\n\nIsrael claims that the protests are aimed at breaching the border and attacking Israeli communities nearby. There were also violent clashes between Israeli police and protesters who raised Palestinian flags outside the new embassy, with several protesters being detained.\n\nTuesday is expected to see larger and potentially more violent demonstrations, as Palestinians bury those killed on Monday and return to protest. Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas condemned the \"massacres against our people,\" and declared three days of mourning.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that \"every nation has the right to defend its borders.\" He added that Hamas \"clearly says its intentions are to destroy Israel and sends thousands to break through the border for that end.\"\n\nA number of Western nations, including the UK, called for restraint. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said, \"We expect all to act with utmost restraint to avoid further loss of life.\" Germany stated that Israel has the right to defend itself but should do so proportionately.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, condemned the \"shocking killing of dozens, injury of hundreds by Israeli live fire.\" A small interim embassy will start operating from Monday inside the existing US consulate building in Jerusalem, with a larger site to be found later when the rest of the embassy moves from Tel Aviv.\n\nThe opening ceremony was brought forward to coincide with the state of Israel's 70th anniversary. The ceremony was attended by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, Ivanka Trump, and Jared Kushner, who are all senior White House advisers.\n\nAfter Ivanka Trump unveiled the seal of the embassy, Jared Kushner said in his address, \"When President Trump makes a promise, he keeps it... We have shown the world that the US can be trusted. We stand with our friends and allies.\" Kushner also referred to Trump's withdrawal from the \"dangerous, flawed, and one-sided Iran deal,\" drawing applause from the guests.\n\nMahmoud Abbas condemned the embassy as a \"settlement in East Jerusalem,\" stating that the US is \"no longer a mediator in the Middle East.\" Arab League chief Ahmed Abul Gheit said it was \"shameful to see countries participating with the US and Israel in celebrating the former's embassy move to occupied Jerusalem in a clear and grave violation of international law.\"\n\nThe status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is not recognized internationally, and, according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war. It effectively annexed the sector, though this was not recognized by any countries until Trump's declaration in December 2017. Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.",

At the age of 12, Warren's father suffered a heart attack, leaving the family on the brink of financial ruin. They nearly lost their family station wagon and their home.\n\nIn a moment of crisis, Warren's mother, who had never worked outside the home, took matters into her own hands. She donned a dress reserved for weddings, funerals, and graduations and secured a minimum-wage job at Sears, thus saving the family from financial ruin.\n\nWarren, who grew up in Oklahoma with three older brothers who joined the military, had dreams of becoming a public school teacher. However, the financial constraints of her family made higher education seem unattainable. Yet, Warren persevered and secured a scholarship to attend George Washington University.\n\nHowever, her journey was not a straightforward one. At 19, Warren dropped out of college after getting engaged, only to return to work as an answerer of phones. Despite the setback, Warren found success in her job and in her personal life.\n\nWarren's life took another turn when she learned about the University of Houston, a public four-year college with affordable tuition. With her part-time waitressing salary, Warren was able to complete her degree and pursue her dream of becoming a teacher for students with speech and learning disabilities.\n\nWarren's story is a testament to the resilience and determination of the American spirit. Despite the challenges she faced, she was able to live her dream and inspire others with her story.",
    " Title: Study Challenges LGBT Left's 'Science' on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a comprehensive study titled \"Sexuality and Gender: Findings from the Biological, Psychological, and Social Sciences,\" scholars Lawrence Mayer and Paul McHugh, both affiliated with Johns Hopkins University, have challenged the widely accepted narrative of the LGBT community regarding sexual orientation and gender identity. The study, published by The New Atlantis, questions the notion that sexual orientation and gender identity are innate, biologically fixed properties of human beings.\n\nThe study asserts that the view that sexual orientation is an innate, biologically fixed property is not supported by scientific evidence. The authors highlight numerous studies finding that sexual orientation is often fluid, with one study showing high rates of abandonment of non-heterosexual identification as young men grow out of adolescence.\n\nRegarding gender identity, the study states that the idea that it is an innate, fixed property independent of biological sex is not supported by scientific evidence. The authors note that only a minority of children who experience \"cross-gender identification\" will continue to do so as they get older.\n\nThe study also reveals that compared to the general population, non-heterosexual subpopulations are at an elevated risk for a variety of adverse health and mental health outcomes. The numbers are sobering, with non-heterosexual populations having 1.5 times the risk of anxiety disorders and substance abuse, twice the risk of depression, and 2.5 times the risk of suicide. The transgender population also is at elevated risk for mental-health problems, with the suicide numbers particularly troubling: \"The rate of lifetime suicide attempts across all ages of transgender individuals is estimated at 41%, compared to under 5% in the overall U.S. population.\"\n\nThe study is lengthy and comprehensive, and when one dives into its depths, it's clear that McHugh and Mayer aren't positing simplistic alternative explanations for human sexuality that would mirror and rebut the Left's narrative. Instead, what emerges is a messy, realistic vision of human beings who are shaped by myriad social, cultural, and biological forces.\n\nThe study spends considerable time discussing the high incidence of childhood sexual and physical abuse in the LGBT community. The authors note that the answer to whether LGBT people experience higher rates of abuse and assault because of their orientation or whether the life-altering experience of abuse and assault contributes to the formation of an LGBT identity is not necessarily either/or. A person can be targeted because they're perceived to be gay, and sexual abuse perpetrated by men might cause boys to think they are gay or make girls averse to sexual contact with men.\n\nThe messy reality described by McHugh and Mayer has been experienced by humans since time immemorial. The LGBT Left's narrative is the new nonsense. However, some on the Left want to end the debate, keeping their moral vision in the public sphere without any competition. The study's findings could potentially fuel further debate and challenge the LGBT community's narrative on sexual orientation and gender identity.",
    " Title: Illinois Becomes 11th State to Legalize Recreational Marijuana, Implementing First Comprehensive Statewide Marketplace\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, Illinois has become the 11th state in the U.S. to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Governor J.B. Pritzker signed a bill on Tuesday, allowing residents to purchase and possess up to one ounce of cannabis at a time, with non-residents permitted to possess up to 15 grams.\n\nThe legislation, which fulfills one of Pritzker's campaign promises, also establishes the nation's first comprehensive statewide cannabis marketplace designed by legislators. This move could potentially clear criminal records for nearly 800,000 people with past convictions for purchasing or possessing 30 grams or less of marijuana.\n\nThe law permits cannabis purchases by adults aged 21 and older at approved dispensaries, which, after they are licensed and established, may start selling from January 1, 2020. However, possession remains a crime until then, a spokesman for Senate Democrats confirmed.\n\nPritzker's successful campaign for governor capitalized on growing public sentiment that law enforcement should focus on more pressing matters than pursuing marijuana users. He projected that taxation of marijuana could generate $800 million to $1 billion annually. Initially, he estimated that in the budget year starting July 1, dispensary licensing would generate $170 million, but this estimate was revised to about $58 million in the final proposal.\n\nThe marketplace portion of the Illinois law also addresses the disproportionate impact of the war on drugs on minority communities. The law provides criminal-record scrubbing for past low-level offenders and gives preference to would-be marijuana vendors in areas of high poverty and with records of large numbers of convictions. Portions of the tax proceeds must be reinvested in impoverished communities.\n\nPolice organizations are wary, expressing concerns about enforcing driving under the influence laws and the need for more development of technology for testing marijuana impairment. They were successful in removing an earlier provision that would have allowed anyone to grow up to five marijuana plants at home for personal use.\n\nTen other states and the District of Columbia have legalized smoking or eating marijuana for recreational use since 2012. Vermont and Michigan were the latest states to legalize marijuana in 2018. Vermont did so through the Legislature, but did not establish a statewide marketplace like Illinois did. Other initiatives have failed, with promising proposals in New York and New Jersey fizzling out late this spring. Despite a statewide listening tour on the issue by Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor last winter, the idea never took flight.",
    " Title: Nobel Prize in Literature 2021: Controversy Surrounds Selection of Peter Handke\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature for 2021 has sparked a wave of controversy, with the selection of Austrian writer Peter Handke, a controversial figure known for his denial of the genocide committed by Serbs against Muslims in Bosnia during the 1990s.\n\nStockholm, more than 1,500 miles from Sarajevo, is the site where the Nobel Committee announced the winner of the prestigious prize. However, the decision to honor Handke, who denies the well-documented genocide in Bosnia, has been met with widespread criticism.\n\nIshmael Reed, an American writer and social critic, expressed his disapproval, stating, \"It's dumbfounding that the Nobel Committee would seize this moment to honor an Austrian writer who defends these war criminals and dissembles on their behalf.\"\n\nHandke's most infamous political offense was attending the funeral of Serbian strongman Slobodan Milo\u0161evic, who died in prison awaiting a trial for genocide and war crimes. Handke's book, \"A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia,\" based on a brief trip he made to Serbia, complained that the media \"relentlessly portray the Serbs as evil.\"\n\nHandke's denial of the genocide in Bosnia is evident in his 1996 essays, collected in the book \"A Journey to the Rivers.\" In these essays, he denies the existence of concentration camps in Bosnia and instead claims that there were camps run by Croats and Muslims as well.\n\nHowever, eyewitness accounts and United Nations war crimes tribunal verdicts prove that the Serb camps in Bosnia were concentration camps, where thousands of prisoners were tortured and killed. Handke's assertion that everyone was complicit in the atrocities committed during the war is a transparent form of deception and deflection.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Handke's work is not a call to boycott his literary work, but rather a concern about the legitimacy that the Nobel Prize bestows upon his entire body of work. Handke's denial of the genocide in Bosnia undermines the truth and the memory of the victims, and it is a disservice to the literary world to honor him with such a prestigious award.",
    " Title: Clinton Campaign Email Reveals Concerns Over Public Perception and Compliance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recently released email from the Clinton campaign's correspondence, former Clinton administration official Bill Ivey expressed concerns about the public's perception of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. The email, sent to John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, on March 13, 2016, discusses the challenge of combating Trump's larger-than-life appeal and the need for a more nuanced approach to engage the electorate.\n\nIvey, who served as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts during Bill Clinton's second term, is a trustee of the Center for American Progress, a think tank closely associated with the Clinton campaign. In the email, Ivey acknowledges the Democrats' apprehension about Clinton's inability to match Trump's celebrity politics, as she is \"not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold.\"\n\nIvey suggests that Trump's success in capturing media attention and public sentiment could not be replicated by Clinton through policy-focused messaging alone. He expresses concern that the left has \"conspired\" to create an \"unaware and compliant citizenry,\" but notes that this strategy is no longer effective due to the erosion of public compliance.\n\n\"The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly,\" Ivey writes. \"This problem demands some serious, serious thinking \u2013 and not just poll-driven, demographically-inspired messaging.\"\n\nIn the email, Ivey admits to the left's role in creating an uninformed and submissive electorate but suggests that this strategy is no longer working. He characterizes public ignorance as a positive for the Clinton campaign, implying that the public needs to be guided in the right direction.\n\nIvey concludes the email by stating that he will attend a Clinton fundraiser and expresses concern that the campaign is navigating forces that cannot be fully understood. The email offers a glimpse into the elitist and condescending mindset that appears to pervade the Clinton campaign, viewing the American public as easily manipulated and unaware.\n\nPaul Joseph Watson, editor-at-large of \u2588\u2588\u2588.com and Prison Planet.com, has commented on the email, stating that it reveals the Clinton campaign's elitist and arrogant attitude towards the American people.",
    " Title: Rep. Tom Cole Discusses Minimum Wage Increase, Accuses White House of Politicizing the Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK) expressed his opposition to an increase in the federal minimum wage but indicated a willingness to consider proposals that include job-creating measures such as the Keystone pipeline project.\n\nCole stated, \"Would I look at a minimum-wage increase if I thought there were other things attached to it that would create jobs like Keystone and additional things? Yeah, I think I would consider that because I think job creation is an important thing; it's something that we've done a pretty miserable job at over the last several years.\"\n\nThis week, a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour was blocked in the U.S. Senate due to a filibuster. The outcome was widely anticipated.\n\nCole acknowledged the argument for raising the wage, but also pointed out the counterargument: individual states can implement their own minimum wage laws, and the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that increasing the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour over three years would result in a reduction of about 500,000 jobs, while significantly boosting wages for low-income workers. The report also noted that the job loss could range from \"very slight\" to as much as 1 million jobs.\n\nCole suggested that the issue has been politicized, stating, \"I suppose the president is certainly supportive of doing this, but let's be real: He's using this as a political weapon.\" He added that if the president were serious about the issue, he would propose other measures that would garner Republican support.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has expressed a willingness to compromise on the wage issue but not on the $10.10 figure. White House press secretary Jay Carney stated on Thursday that offering a different number might not be effective, as Republican leaders have not expressed interest in a lower figure.",
    " Title: The Unconventional Candidates: A Comparative Analysis of Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg in the 2020 Democratic Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2020 Democratic primary race, the contest between Sen. Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg is proving to be an intriguing and unconventional matchup. Both candidates, like President Donald Trump, are beneficiaries of the hollowed-out political parties, as they represent strands of liberalism with long-standing pedigrees that have historically intertwined and overlapped.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, can trace his lineage back to antiwar socialists and populists such as William Jennings Bryan and Eugene Debs, as well as reformers such as Jane Addams. His supporters admire his consistent advocacy for democratic socialism and his unwavering stance against economic elites, particularly the \"billionaire class.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman, represents a different kind of liberalism, one that is less ideological and more pragmatic. As the mayor of New York, he was known for his technocratic approach to governance, prioritizing data over feelings. His policies, such as the controversial stop-and-frisk program and the soda ban, have been criticized for their impact on minority communities.\n\nBloomberg's supporters view him as a credentialed upper-class figure who, in recent years, has become the liberals' \"Chicago way\" response to Trump. If the Right comes at you with a billionaire would-be Putin, the argument goes, you come back with a bigger billionaire would-be Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nThe contest between Sanders and Bloomberg is significant, as it could potentially define the Democratic Party in the same way that Trump has defined the Republican Party. If Sanders wins the nomination, the Democratic Party could become a populist party of Social Democrats. If Bloomberg wins, the Democrats could become the party of bureaucratic authoritarianism.\n\nIt is important to note that other options exist for primary voters. However, the choice between these two candidates is zero-sum, and if either man wins, the Democratic Party could end up making a choice that will define it as much as Trump has come to define the GOP. The stakes are high, and the outcome of this contest could shape the future of American politics.",
    " Title: International Controversy Surrounds Potential U.S. Purchase of Greenland: A Look at the Controversy and Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the potential purchase of Greenland by the United States has sparked international controversy and raised questions about the future of the autonomous Danish territory. The Danish prime minister's office did not immediately return a call on Friday seeking comment.\n\nSocial media users were quick to exploit the report, with some photoshopping images of pompous-looking golden towers into pictures of Greenlandic villages with colorful two-story wooden houses, while others joked about trading Greenland for Hawaii. However, at the center of the international contretemps, there was little to laugh about, politicians and residents said.\n\n\"It's never nice to be treated as a commodity,\" said Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, a Greenlandic member of the Danish Parliament. Greenland, a nation of 56,000, has a shared history with Denmark since the first Vikings settled there a millennium ago. If that relationship were to change, it would not be up to Denmark and certainly not up to an American president's \"impulse,\" said Henrik O. Breitenbauch, an expert on Greenland and the head of the Center for Military Studies at Copenhagen University.\n\n\"You don't just trade people and countries,\" Mr. Breitenbauch added.\n\nThe speculation is that President Trump, a former real estate developer, was keen on Greenland because he tends to see the world through a prism of acquisitions. Greenland, located among both friendly and hostile neighbors, has everything a real estate investor could desire in terms of fresh air, direct access to the sea, an abundance of shrimp, cod, and halibut, and a backyard rich with lucrative minerals.\n\nNearby international sea routes allow for quick passage to all corners of the globe (when the ice permits). However, the island's population may see little to gain from exchanging the Danish queen as their head of state with an American president who has angered traditional allies by disparaging NATO and pulling the United States out of long-held treaties like the Paris climate accord.\n\n\"Greenland could choose to become Puerto Rico with snow, but I doubt there's much interest in that,\" Mr. Breitenbauch said, referring to the unincorporated United States territory. The potential purchase of Greenland has raised concerns about the future of the autonomous Danish territory and the implications for its relationship with Denmark and the United States.",

He emphasized the importance of the press, but also stated that they cannot place lives at risk with impunity.\n\n\"We respect the important role that the press plays and will give them respect, but it is not unlimited.

Both political parties have condemned the leak.\n\nThe debate over the role of journalists and the government's response to leaks is expected to continue as the investigation unfolds.",
    " Title: CDC Officials Receive Millions in Bonuses While Facing Criticism for Ebola Response\n\nArticle:\n\nTop public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have received $25 million in bonuses since 2007, according to data compiled by American Transparency's OpenTheBooks.com. This comes as the agency's headcount increased by 23 percent during the same period, despite relatively flat funding.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2013, all federal wages were frozen due to budgetary constraints, but CDC officials found a way to pay themselves through bonuses, overtime, within-grade increases, and promotion pay raises. Donald Shriber, deputy director of policy and communication at the CDC's Center for Global Health, received the highest bonus in the six years analyzed\u2014$62,895 in 2011.\n\nKathleen Dunlap, deputy budget director at the CDC, was awarded an $8,000 bonus last year, the highest among her fellow employees. Ms. Dunlap didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe CDC's handling of the Ebola outbreak has been criticized, and the agency has been accused of using budgetary constraints as an excuse for its response. National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins told The Huffington Post last week that the CDC had been working on an Ebola vaccine for more than a decade but was hampered by shrinking budgets.\n\nTwo health care workers who treated an Ebola patient in Dallas have contracted the disease, raising serious questions about the hospital's procedures. Statistics from the United Nations World Health Organization place the death toll from the Ebola outbreak at 4,447, the vast majority in West Africa.\n\n\"Frankly, if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would've gone through clinical trials and would have been ready,\" Mr. Collins told the news site.\n\nThe CDC's budget has remained relatively flat since President Obama took office. In fiscal year 2010, the budget request for CDC funding was $6.31 billion. In Mr. Obama's latest budget request, funding is set at $5.39 billion, with additional contributions of $809 million expected from the Prevention and Public Health Fund\u2014totalizing about $6.2 billion.\n\nAmid stagnating funding, the CDC still handed out bonuses and added 1,888 positions from 2007 to 2013, data show. Employees at the CDC earn more than the federal average. According to figures kept by the Office of Personnel Management, the average salary for a full-time federal employee working on a permanent appointment was $79,030 as of September 2013, the most recent date for which the figure has been released. The average salary for a CDC employee was $95,015 last year, OpenTheBooks shows.\n\n\"Employees at the embattled CDC have been making millions in higher-than-average salaries and bonuses,\" said OpenTheBooks.com founder Adam Andrzejewski. \"CDC executives 'gamed the system' to increase employee pay through bonuses during three years of the 'official federal wage freeze.' CDC officials should be focused on preventing diseases rather than pumping up their salaries.\"\n\nExcluding Atlanta, where the CDC is based, CDC employees at the National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Maryland, received the largest federal payout of $304 million in total wages from 2007 to 2013, as well as about $640,000 in bonuses. CDC sites in Cincinnati; Chamblee, Georgia; Bruceton, Pennsylvania; and Morgantown, West Virginia, all had CDC staff earning more than $100 million from 2007 to 2013. They also collectively paid out $1.8 million in bonuses.\n\nIt's too early to tell whether it was money well spent, Mr. Andrzejewski said. \"The CDC's mission is to protect the health of the nation, but will these highly compensated executives be successful and earn their pay, not to mention bonuses?\" he asked.",
    " Title: Examining Potential Policy Changes for Transgender Service Members in the U.S. Military: A RAND Study Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research organization, has conducted a comprehensive study on the health care needs, costs, and potential implications of transition-related treatments for transgender service members in the U.S. military. The study, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), aims to provide insights into the policies that may need to be adjusted if transgender personnel are allowed to serve openly.\n\nThe report identifies the health care needs of the transgender population, with a focus on transgender service members. It also examines the costs associated with transition-related treatments, assesses the potential impact on force readiness and deployability, and reviews the experiences of foreign militaries that permit transgender personnel to serve openly.\n\nThe study, part of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 research report series, underwent rigorous peer review to ensure high standards for research quality and objectivity. The report is not intended to reflect the opinions of the research clients and sponsors but rather to provide unbiased, factual, and informative findings.\n\nThe RAND Corporation is a federally funded research and development center sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Unified Combatant Commands, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the defense agencies, and the defense Intelligence Community. The report is available for personal use, but commercial use is prohibited. Unauthorized posting of the report's PDF to a non-RAND website is also prohibited.\n\nThis research could potentially inform policy decisions regarding the inclusion of transgender service members in the U.S. military, providing a valuable resource for understanding the associated health care needs, costs, and implications.",
    " Title: Former State Department Official Explains Obama Administration's Avoidance of \"Radical Islamic Extremism\" Label\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent op-ed published in The New York Times, Richard Stengal, a former State Department official, has shed light on the reasons behind the Obama administration's reluctance to use the phrase \"radical Islamic extremism\" to describe the ideology.\n\nStengal, who served as the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, explained that the practical reason for this avoidance was not due to timidity or political correctness, as critics often suggested. Instead, he argued, the Obama administration refrained from using the term to maintain relationships with key Islamic allies, including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAccording to Stengal, these allies believed that the term unfairly vilified an entire religion and did not consider the Islamic State to be Islamic. He added that the Islamic State's violent actions against Muslims proved their stance.\n\nStengal further argued that the Trump administration should continue with the previous administration's strategy, as ISIS as a military force is currently \"on the ropes\" in Iraq and Syria. He also suggested that Trump administration officials should reassure these Arab allies that references to \"radical Islam\" and \"Islamic extremism\" are directed only at the small percentage of the world's Muslim population that has embraced violence.\n\nDespite this, Stengal expressed apprehension about the new direction the administration is taking. He emphasized that it is not up to the U.S. to define what is Islamic and what is not. Instead, he argued, the voices of mainstream Muslims and independent clerics in Muslim countries are crucial in refuting the Islamic State's narrative and offering a more positive alternative. This, he suggested, could potentially hinder the group's recruiting efforts.",
    " Title: President Trump Warns of Long-Term Aid for Puerto Rico, Amidst Ongoing Recovery Efforts and Financial Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of early-morning tweets on Thursday, President Donald Trump issued a warning to Puerto Rico, stating that the U.S. territory's infrastructure was in a state of disrepair before the hurricanes and that federal aid cannot remain indefinitely on the island.\n\nThe president's comments come just one week after his visit to Puerto Rico, which is still grappling with the devastation left by Hurricane Maria, the strongest hurricane to hit the island in nearly a century. Trump's trip was met with criticism, particularly for his comments on the storm's death toll, which he compared to that of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\n\"Sixteen people versus in the thousands,\" Trump said, referring to the number of deaths in Puerto Rico and those in New Orleans during Katrina. \"You can be very proud of all your people.\"\n\nThe president has repeatedly called for more help \"on a local level\" from Puerto Rico and has had an intermittent feud with the San Juan mayor, who has also faced criticism for engaging in political combat while other officials on the island are not.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded to Trump's latest tweets, questioning, \"Why do you continue to treat Puerto Ricans differently than other Americans when it comes to natural disasters?\"\n\nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), there were more than 10,000 federal officials on the ground on the island earlier this month. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is scheduled to lead a small bipartisan group, including the chairman and top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, to visit Puerto Rico on Friday. Ryan plans to meet with local officials and emergency personnel.\n\nThe House is expected to vote this week on an emergency spending package, which includes billions of dollars more in relief for Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida in the wake of the deadly storms Maria, Harvey, and Irma this hurricane season. The president has also requested a $4.9 billion loan to help Puerto Rico pay its bills from the storm. The island faced more than $70 billion in debt prior to the storm and declared bankruptcy in May.",
    " Title: Former Senator Rick Santorum Ponders 2016 Presidential Run, Discusses Policy Ideas and Party Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum has expressed uncertainty about a potential 2016 presidential run, but has not ruled out the possibility. The former senator, who is currently serving as CEO of EchoLight Studios, a movie studio focused on faith and family-themed films, cites personal and professional commitments as reasons for not pursuing another White House bid.\n\nSantorum, who ran an upstart campaign in 2012, surviving until Mitt Romney's last remaining rival, acknowledges the challenges he faced in the 2012 primary, including difficulty raising funds and securing support from establishment Republicans. However, his socially conservative profile did earn him victories in 11 states.\n\nIn his new book, \"Blue Collar Conservatives: Recommitting to an America That Works,\" Santorum offers policy ideas on energy, education, the economy, and healthcare. The book, set to be released on Monday, is part think tank policy paper, part campaign playbook, and part communications advice on connecting with working-class voters.\n\nSantorum argues that the Republican Party needs to shift its focus from business leaders and \"job creators\" to employees, as anxiety among working-class voters remains high. He believes that the party has for too long been speaking to the top earners while neglecting the workers.\n\n\"A rising tide lifts all boats\u2014unless your boat has a hole in it. A lot of Americans, we've got holes in our boats,\" Santorum said. \"Millions and millions of Americans (are) out there who want good lives but have holes in their boats.\"\n\nSantorum also criticizes the libertarian streak within the Republican Party, stating that it distorts the definition of freedom and that politicians wrongly look to President Ronald Reagan's policies to address today's challenges. He also takes a swipe at Republicans who demonize social welfare programs, questioning whether they truly care less about the less fortunate than Democrats do.\n\nThe tough talk in Santorum's book raises questions about his viability in a potentially crowded 2016 primary field. Santorum is not rushing to campaign in early nominating states like Iowa or New Hampshire, stating that he would wait at least a year before deciding on a 2016 bid.\n\nSantorum's personal life, particularly the health of his daughter Bella, who has a genetic disorder, also plays a role in his decision-making process. Bella, who has Trisomy 18, a condition that causes brain, heart, and internal organ developmental abnormalities, turns 6 in May. Santorum is currently working on a book about his daughter and has been kept awake by her difficult nights.\n\nFamily issues will be a key factor in Santorum's decision to run or not, and Bella's health will be a significant consideration. His other six children, Santorum said, are supportive of another run.\n\nThe Republican Party's direction in the 2014 elections is a focus of Santorum's latest book. He argues that the party is heading towards \"No-ville,\" a place where they are against this, against that, without painting a positive vision for America.\n\nAfter the 2012 campaign, Santorum joined EchoLight Studios as CEO, seeing an opportunity to produce movies with a faith message that are better than those that have been done. Santorum's daughter Bella keeps him busy at home.",
    " Title: U.S. and Iran Nuclear Talks: A 50-50 Prospect as Key Issues Remain Unresolved\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing Iran nuclear talks are progressing, but significant issues remain unresolved, creating a 50-50 chance of reaching a deal. This is according to top U.S. officials who are emerging from closed-door negotiations with their Iranian counterparts, aiming to broker a lasting deal that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe Obama administration is employing a strategic messaging approach to reassure key domestic constituencies, maintain the unity of the international coalition involved in the negotiations, and exert pressure on Iran. According to Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Washington-based Brookings Institution and a former State Department Iran policy adviser, this messaging strategy is crucial for setting the expectations of the negotiating parties and the political context at home.\n\nSkeptics in Congress want to see a tough U.S. stance and the pursuit of the best possible deal. International partners want to ensure that the U.S. has not brought them to the negotiating table for nothing. Iran, on the other hand, needs to understand that the U.S. will not concede certain points and is willing to walk away if necessary.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry reiterated this message during a press conference on Thursday, stating that the U.S. is not prepared to sit at the negotiating table indefinitely. However, he also emphasized that the U.S. is not under time pressure and should not abandon negotiations simply because the deadline has passed.\n\nSen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a key Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, interpreted Kerry's words as a determination to send a message to Iran's Supreme Leader: \"The deal that is on the table is the best deal you're going to get. You either need to accept it or we're going to walk away.\"\n\nMaloney explained that Kerry and other officials' statements are a calculated attempt to influence Iranian decision-making from the outside. However, these statements also serve another purpose: addressing the concerns of restless members of Congress who fear that Iran is gaining the upper hand and sticking to its demands while the U.S. concedes.\n\nBy missing the July 9 deadline set by Congress and initiating a 60-day congressional review period instead of the initial 30 days, the administration now faces twice as much time for vocal opponents to scrutinize the deal's details and rally votes against it.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Obama administration has emphasized its willingness to walk away from negotiations if Iran does not relent on the final, crucial sticking points. President Barack Obama stated last week that he would walk away from the negotiations if the deal is not favorable, while Kerry reiterated on Thursday that the U.S. is prepared to end the process if the tough decisions are not made.\n\nThis tough stance gives some in Congress hope that the Obama administration is holding firm. However, it is unclear whether the more hardened skeptics are convinced by the administration's insistence that it is not flinching on key points.\n\n\"There's still frustration and an overwhelming skepticism toward the administration and its ability to hold a hard line with respect to Iran,\" said Maloney.\n\nThe messaging of walking away from a deal also reinforces the administration's argument that it has worked tirelessly to obtain a good deal and, therefore, has achieved the best possible one if a deal is reached. If no deal is reached, the messaging will help to manage expectations.\n\nPresident Obama told Senate Democrats this week that it is more likely that there will be no deal. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, reported that Obama said the chances are below 50-50.\n\nDays later, Kerry expressed optimism, stating that some outstanding issues had been resolved and that progress had been made. However, the coalition of five world powers negotiating alongside the U.S. is already showing signs of strain, with Russia adopting a stance on relaxing sanctions more in line with Iran's. The new Iranian demand for the lifting of the arms embargo has caused frustration for the U.S. while winning support from Moscow.\n\nUnder no circumstances should the U.S. relieve pressure on Iran regarding ballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking, stated Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey this week on Capitol Hill. The ongoing negotiations remain a delicate balance of pressure and diplomacy, with the U.S. and its partners working to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon while maintaining the unity of the international coalition and managing domestic expectations.",

He criticized older Democrats for not relinquishing control, citing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's age as an example.\n\nIn the interview, Hogg noted that U.S. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan was 45 when he took up the leadership role. He expressed his intention to spend the next several months meeting with other activists and canvasing in advance of the midterm elections.\n\nIf obstacles were non-existent, Hogg stated that he would attend college in the fall of 2019, followed by a year off in 2020 to work on a presidential campaign. He also mentioned that some candidates have already approached him for potential collaboration.\n\nAfter college, Hogg plans to prepare for his congressional run, stating, \"I think I\u2019ve come to that conclusion. I want to be at least part of the change in Congress.\"\n\nHogg also expressed his admiration for Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, predicting her success in the White House. However, he expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of the Democratic Party, stating, \"Sen. Bernie Sanders is a great guy, terrible on guns. [Former President Obama] increased drone warfare and killed a lot of civilians.... Honestly, they all kind of suck.\"",
    " Title: Hurricane Florence Approaches US East Coast, Threatening Millions with Extreme Weather Conditions\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Hurricane Florence, now a category three storm with maximum sustained winds of 120mph (195km/h), approaches the US East Coast, officials are urging millions of residents to evacuate before the storm makes landfall as early as Thursday evening. The National Weather Service has warned that the hurricane is \"extremely dangerous\" and could bring \"unbelievable damage\" from wind, storm surge, and inland flooding.\n\nUp to 1.7 million people have been ordered to evacuate across South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. Four South Carolina motorways have been diverted one-way to speed the exodus. Georgia has declared a state of emergency, following the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington DC.\n\nA National Weather Service forecaster said, \"This will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast.\" The forecaster went on to say, \"I can't emphasize enough the potential for unbelievable damage from wind, storm surge, and inland flooding with this storm.\"\n\nJeff Byard, of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said, \"This is going to be a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast.\" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned that \"disaster is at the doorstep\" and \"tens of thousands\" of buildings may be flooded.\n\nWaves 83ft (25m) tall were recorded at sea on Wednesday morning. While many coastal residents have complied with mandatory evacuation orders, others are boarding up their homes and vowing to ride out the storm.\n\nFlorence could wreak more than $170bn (\u00a3130bn) of havoc and damage nearly 759,000 homes and businesses, says analytics firm CoreLogic. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd left hundreds of thousands of dead hogs and chickens floating in floodwaters in North Carolina.\n\nNearly 1,000 prisoners in South Carolina will not be moved from their cells, despite a mandatory evacuation order in the area. A state department of corrections spokesman said, \"In the past, it's been safer to leave them there.\"\n\nThere are fears for wild horse herds in North Carolina's Outer Banks, but experts say these equines can sense bad weather coming and head to higher ground.\n\nIn a video posted to his Twitter account on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump warned residents in Florence's bullseye to heed official warnings. \"Get out of its way, don't play games with it,\" said Mr. Trump. \"It's a big one, maybe as big as they've seen, and tremendous amounts of water.\"\n\nEuropean astronaut Alexander Gerst shared images of Florence's eye wall from space, calling the storm a \"no-kidding nightmare.\" Forecasters say the storm poses such a threat because it is expected to slow down and hover for nearly two days over the Carolina coast, before dipping south towards Georgia.\n\nIt is forecast to bring 20-40in (50-100cm) of rain and life-threatening storm surges of up to 13ft. As of Wednesday evening, officials say these surges are now \"highly likely\" as Florence churns closer. The National Weather Service also predicts \"catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding\" in parts of the Carolinas and Appalachians.\n\nHurricane force winds will emanate up to 70 miles from the centre of the storm, say meteorologists. National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham warned that waterways up to 40 miles inland may flood. He added that half of fatalities during hurricanes are caused by storm surges, and another quarter of deaths are due to inland rains and flooding.\n\nThe relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one. Warmer seas power hurricanes, so as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. However, there are so many factors that contribute to these rare events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data.",
    " Title: Clinton Taps into Black Voter Anger over Supreme Court Vacancy, Accuses Republicans of Racial Insensitivity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, political tensions have escalated, with Democratic state representative Stacey Abrams of Georgia, and House minority leader, stating that the election on Nov. 8 can no longer be viewed as a mere theoretical exercise.\n\nFor Hillary Clinton, the court issue could be particularly significant, given her increasing reliance on nonwhite voters to secure her victory against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Should she emerge victorious over Sanders, who has galvanized many liberals, she will need a compelling issue to motivate President Obama's loyalists to vote.\n\nClinton moved swiftly on Tuesday to capitalize on the anger of blacks over the Republican Senate's opposition to President Obama's nomination of a replacement for Justice Scalia. In a speech before a predominantly black audience in Harlem, Clinton criticized the Republican Senate's stance, stating, \"Now the Republicans say they'll reject anyone President Obama nominates no matter how qualified. Some are even saying he doesn't have the right to nominate anyone! As if somehow he's not the real president.\"\n\nClinton further accused the Republicans of a longstanding pattern of mistreatment, stating, \"They demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe. This kind of hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics or our country.\"\n\nRepublicans have been sensitive about the notion that they are diminishing President Obama due to his race, and spokesmen for several Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, declined to comment or were unavailable for comment. The suggestion that racism is a factor has sparked anger among McConnell's allies, who point out his formative political experience working for a Republican senator who supported civil rights, his role in overriding President Ronald Reagan's veto of sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa, and his marriage to an Asian-American woman.",
    " Title: U.S. Court of Appeals Rulings Split on Affordable Care Act Subsidies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a split decision, two U.S. appeals courts have issued conflicting rulings on the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) subsidies, with one court striking down subsidies in states that did not establish their own insurance exchanges, and the other upholding them.\n\nThe first decision, handed down by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, invalidated subsidies for the 36 states that did not set up their own insurance exchanges. The Obama administration has announced its intention to seek a review by the full 11-judge panel, with a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice stating, \"We believe that this decision is incorrect, inconsistent with Congressional intent, different from previous rulings, and at odds with the goal of the law: to make health care affordable no matter where people live.\"\n\nThe potential impact of this decision could affect nearly 5 million Americans who signed up for Obamacare through federal exchanges, according to California Healthline. If subsidies were to be removed, millions of U.S. residents could become uninsured, as health plans sold through the exchange might become unaffordable without the assistance.\n\nIn a separate ruling, the three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit unanimously decided that the ambiguity in the ACA's language allows for subsidies to be given to both those who signed up using state exchanges and those who used federal exchanges on behalf of states.\n\nThe conflicting decisions stem from the interpretation of the ACA's language regarding subsidies for Americans who bought insurance through exchanges set up by states and the federal government. In his concurring opinion, Senior Circuit Judge Raymond Randolph of the D.C. Circuit court stated, \"An Exchange established by the federal government can not possibly be 'an Exchange established by the State.' To hold otherwise would be to engage in distortion, not interpretation. Only further legislation could accomplish the expansion the government seeks.\"\n\nThe future of this dispute may ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.",
    " Title: Trump's Claim of 'Total Authority' Sparks Constitutional Concerns Amidst Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is currently grappling with two significant crises: the coronavirus pandemic and the presidency of Donald Trump. The latter's connection to the administration's handling of the pandemic response is not merely political rhetoric. Unlike previous presidents who focused on meeting the challenges posed by crises, Trump prioritizes the pandemic only insofar as it serves to bolster his power and image.\n\nDuring a recent press briefing, Trump asserted that as president, he holds \"total authority.\" This claim, however, is unconstitutional and untrue. The Constitution divides federal authority among the three branches of government, and the 10th Amendment explicitly delegates power to the states.\n\nTrump's assertion of \"total authority\" has raised concerns, as it contradicts the basic principles of the U.S. political system. If former President Obama had made such a claim, conservative protesters would have taken to the streets, supported by Fox News and GOP leaders. Yet, Trump's autocratic assertions are met with silence and assent.\n\nThe federal government, under President Trump, appears to be incapable of performing its duties during a national emergency. Trump wants all the power, all the credit, and none of the responsibility. This combination of authoritarianism and fecklessness poses a threat to American democracy and public health.\n\nIn the absence of federal leadership, the nation's governors are devising their own solutions. Governors such as Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) are forming partnerships with neighboring states to plan for reopening their economies.\n\nVoters should remember not just that Trump mismanaged this deadly pandemic, but that his behavior during the crisis constituted a crisis in its own right. The November election may provide a remedy for Trump's behavior.",
    " Title: Open Carry Advocates' Public Presence Sparks Controversy and Fear in Daily Life\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a growing trend across the United States, open carry enthusiasts are increasingly making their presence felt in public places, sparking debates and causing unease among citizens. The recent Georgia law, which allows the open carrying of deadly weapons at all times and in all places, has further fueled this phenomenon.\n\nA recent incident at a park where children were playing little league baseball saw an armed man waving his gun and shouting, creating a disturbing atmosphere for the parents. Despite the police finding no legal infringement, the incident left the parents feeling alarmed and forced to leave. This incident highlights the tension between the exercise of the Second Amendment right and the general public's sense of safety.\n\nFollowing the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, open carry advocates staged demonstrations at Starbucks stores nationwide, including in Newtown, Connecticut. These demonstrations caused no incidents, but the CEO of Starbucks politely requested that these gun proliferation supporters refrain from using Starbucks as a platform for their demonstrations, citing employee safety concerns.\n\nLast week, open carry proponents staged a demonstration at a Jack in the Box, causing such fear among employees that they sought refuge in the walk-in freezer. The police, assuming an armed robbery was in progress, responded with a large presence.\n\nOne of the demonstrators, Haros, defended their actions, stating, \"We're not breaking the laws, we're not here to hurt anybody. We're not trying to alarm anybody. We're doing this because it's our constitutional right.\" Haros believes that open carry demonstrations serve a safety purpose, as police cannot be everywhere at all times.\n\nHowever, critics argue that these demonstrations infringe on the rights of others. In situations where open carry advocates are present, individuals may feel uncomfortable expressing their opinions, and employees may feel pressured to serve armed customers. In the real world, sane people do not confront armed individuals, and the general public is left questioning the line between exercising a constitutional right and causing unnecessary fear and discomfort.\n\nAs the open carry movement continues to gain momentum, the line between personal freedom and public safety becomes increasingly blurred, leaving many Americans questioning the true meaning of freedom in the presence of armed citizens.",
    " Title: Romney's Overseas Trip: A Mixed Bag of Successes and Controversies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final leg of his three-country tour, Mitt Romney's overseas trip, aimed at showcasing his foreign policy expertise, has been marked by both substantive highlights and distractions. As the Republican candidate wrapped up his visit in Poland, a senior Romney adviser, Stuart Stevens, expressed confidence in the trip's success.\n\n\"I think it was a great success,\" Stevens said after Romney's foreign policy speech in Warsaw. \"The idea is that, can people get a good sense of who he is? Can people listen and see that this is a person speaking from the heart about Israel and about Poland?\" Stevens added.\n\nRomney's speech at Poland's national library offered an emotional tribute to the country's journey from the Iron Curtain to the economic envy of Europe. \"I, and my fellow Americans, are inspired by the path of freedom tread by the people of Poland,\" Romney said.\n\nHowever, the trip has been marred by several controversies. The trouble began in Britain, where Romney publicly questioned whether London was ready to host the Summer Olympic Games. This led to a public rebuke from British Prime Minister David Cameron, who labeled Romney's comments as \"not-so-subtle digs.\"\n\nIn Israel, Romney's policy advisers declined to comment on his comments, and the candidate himself took only three questions from the traveling press corps. Controversy also arose from Romney's remarks on Jerusalem and the economic disparity between Israelis and Palestinians, which inflamed already raw feelings in the region.\n\nDuring the final hours in Poland, the Romney campaign spoke of its \"great success\" while facing criticism over perceived gaffes. A heated exchange between the campaign's traveling press secretary and reporters at the Polish Tomb of the Unknown Soldier made headlines, with the press secretary reportedly shouting, \"Kiss my ass. This is a holy site.\"\n\nDespite the controversies, the campaign has received positive reviews from supporters and U.S. television networks, according to Romney's senior adviser. As Romney returns to the U.S., he will be greeted by a slew of new ads and a mobile app about his VP selection process.\n\nConservative bloggers have protested that Romney's overseas trip has been unfairly judged in the media, with one blogger, John Hinderaker of Powerline, writing, \"By any reasonable standard, Romney's trip has been successful. Yet press coverage has been unrelentingly negative.\" However, Fox News Channel anchor Greta Van Susteren, a frequent interviewee of Romney, had a different assessment of the coverage, writing, \"There has been no press access to Governor Romney since we landed in Poland. We (press) are in a holding pattern.\"",

These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!\" He followed up with another tweet, \"Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner. The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better!\"\n\nThe attack, which occurred at a London subway station, was declared a \"terrorist incident\" by London's Metropolitan Police, who reported that the incident was caused by the detonation of an improvised explosive device.\n\nFollowing the attack, President Trump spoke with British Prime Minister Theresa May to express his sympathies and prayers for the injured. The White House released a statement, saying, \"The President pledged to continue close collaboration with the United Kingdom to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism.\"\n\nIn a series of early morning tweets, President Trump also criticized political correctness and reiterated his support for the travel ban, which is currently being contested in the courts. He tweeted, \"The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!\"\n\nTrump also claimed, \"We have made more progress in the last nine months against ISIS than the Obama Administration has made in 8 years.\" He added, \"We have to be very smart. We have to be very, very tough.\"\n\nIn response to President Trump's tweets, former chief of staff to Prime Minister May, Nick Timothy, criticized the President's use of the term \"loser terrorist.\" Timothy tweeted, \"True or not\u2014and I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t know\u2014this is so unhelpful from leader of our ally and intelligence partner.\"\n\nPrime Minister May also released a statement, saying, \"My thoughts are with those injured at Parsons Green and emergency services who are responding bravely to this incident.\"",
    " Title: New Jersey Becomes 14th State to Allow Illegal Immigrants to Obtain Driver's Licenses\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill on Thursday, expanding access to driver's licenses for illegal immigrants, making the Garden State the 14th state in the country, along with the District of Columbia, to enact such a measure.\n\n\"Expanding access to driver's licenses is critical for the safety of New Jerseyans and a step toward building a stronger and fairer New Jersey for all,\" Murphy said.\n\nThe bill, which was approved by the Democratic majorities in both the state Assembly and Senate during their final legislative sessions of the year, allows individuals over the age of 16 who are illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and learner's permits. Applicants can use foreign documents such as passports or their old driver's license from their home country to complete the process. A Social Security number is not required, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe law reportedly establishes two types of licenses. One would conform to federal REAL ID requirements and would require proof of legal residency. The second license would only require six points of identification. The applicant would not have to provide proof of U.S. citizenship.\n\nA similar measure known as \"The Green Light Law\" was signed by New York's Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo earlier this year and went into effect this week. It also allows illegal immigrants to obtain a license without having to provide a Social Security number or proof of American citizenship.\n\nFox News' Danielle Wallace and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
    " Title: The New York Times' Controversial Decision to Publish Senator Tom Cotton's Op-Ed: A Closer Look at the Criticisms and Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe publication of Senator Tom Cotton's Op-Ed in The New York Times has sparked a heated debate, with critics questioning the paper's editorial standards and the motives behind its decision to publish the controversial piece. The Op-Ed, which advocated for the use of military force to quell civil unrest, has been met with criticism on several fronts, including its tone, legal arguments, and potential impact on public safety, particularly for the black community.\n\nOne criticism leveled against the paper is that the Op-Ed did not meet The Times' editorial standards, with some arguing that the piece would have been more acceptable if Senator Cotton had presented a stronger case with more nuanced arguments and a less confrontational tone. Some critics suggest that the paper's supposed flaws in the Op-Ed may have been a pretext for achieving a politically desired outcome, following a staff revolt.\n\nAnother criticism is that the paper could have examined Senator Cotton's views without giving him an unmediated platform. Instead, his proposal should have been evaluated by the news department, not published uncritically in the Opinion pages. The argument is that his views are controversial and should have been presented in a more balanced and critical manner.\n\nHowever, the value of the Op-Ed does not lie in its goodness or rightness, but rather in the fact that Senator Cotton is a leading spokesman for a significant segment of public opinion. Denying readers the opportunity to examine his opinions for themselves is seen as patronizing, and suggesting they should look up his opinions elsewhere is seen as a betrayal of the newspaper's responsibility as a newspaper of record.\n\nThe most serious criticism is that the publication of the piece puts black lives at risk, including members of The Times' staff. This is a valid concern, especially in the current climate of increased reports of hate crimes. However, it is not the duty of the paper to make people feel safe by refusing to publish dismaying Op-Eds. The knowledge of Senator Cotton's views, whether one agrees with them or not, can be a source of strength in understanding and countering his arguments.\n\nIn conclusion, the publication of Senator Tom Cotton's Op-Ed in The New York Times has sparked a heated debate, with critics questioning the paper's editorial standards and the motives behind its decision. While the piece has been met with criticism on several fronts, it is essential to consider the value of the Op-Ed as a reflection of a significant segment of public opinion and the importance of open and critical discourse in a democratic society.",
    " Title: US Imposes New Sanctions on Russia Over Salisbury Poisoning Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Russian rouble has plummeted to its lowest level since November 2016, following the announcement of new US sanctions in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the UK. The dollar-rouble rate reached 66.7 on the Moscow stock exchange, marking a significant drop from Tuesday's rate of 63.4.\n\nThe attack, which occurred in Salisbury in March, involved the use of the Russian nerve agent Novichok. Both Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia have since recovered, though their current whereabouts remain undisclosed. The US has determined that Russia \"has used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law,\" according to US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert.\n\nThe new sanctions, which will take effect on or around August 22, cover exports of sensitive electronic components and other technologies that can have military applications. There will also be some further restrictions on Russian access to US financial services. If Russia fails to provide reliable assurances that it will no longer use chemical weapons and allow on-site inspections by the United Nations, more draconian sanctions, including a far-reaching trade embargo and a ban on Aeroflot flights to the US, may be imposed within 90 days.\n\nThe US and EU have previously imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian state officials and firms accused of involvement in the 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. These sanctions restrict travel and financial transactions.\n\nThe Russian embassy in the US has responded to the new sanctions, stating that it has become \"accustomed to not hearing any facts or evidence\" and reiterating its call for an open and transparent investigation of the Salisbury incident. The UK Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, thanked the US for its support and emphasized the importance of preventing chemical weapons from becoming a new norm.\n\nThe new sanctions come after pressure from Republican members of Congress, who have been pushing for a formal determination that Russia had broken international law by using a military-grade chemical weapon on the Skripals. The US expelled some five dozen diplomats shortly after the poisoning, but stopped short of making a formal determination until now.\n\nThe Salisbury incident and subsequent events have strained relations between Russia and the West, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK. The attack prompted the UK to blame Russia for the use of the nerve agent Novichok, and relations between the two nations have reached a new low. In addition to the Skripal case, two other individuals fell ill in Amesbury, eight miles from Salisbury, in June. One of them, Dawn Sturgess, later died, while her partner, Charlie Rowley, spent three weeks recovering in hospital. Tests conducted at the UK's military research lab, Porton Down, found that the couple had also been exposed to Novichok.",
    " Title: U.S. Prisons and Jails Struggle to Contain COVID-19 Outbreaks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark revelation, the New York Times has reported on the devastating impact of the coronavirus in federal prisons, with the Federal Correctional Complex in Oakdale, Louisiana, being one of the hardest hit. Patrick Jones, a 49-year-old inmate serving a 27-year sentence for possession of crack cocaine, became the first federal inmate to die of the virus on March 28. As of now, at least seven inmates have died, over 100 inmates and staff members have been infected, with more than 20 hospitalized.\n\nThe situation in Cook County Jail, the largest in the country, is equally dire. With four inmates dead and 215 testing positive, the jail is already one of the nation's largest sources of infections. The virus has also claimed the life of one employee. Sheriff Tom Dart, who has been open about the situation, has urged for more help due to the overwhelming nature of the crisis.\n\nIn Ohio, 2,300 prisoners in three prisons have tested positive, making it the largest reported source of coronavirus infection in the United States. Prisons and jails across the country are grappling with the virus, with inmates locked up for nonviolent crimes or awaiting trial, and older, vulnerable inmates near the end of their term, among others, living in fear of a potential death sentence.\n\nPrisons and jails are proving to be virtual petri dishes for the virus, with social distancing impossible and basic hygiene facilities often inadequate. Correctional officers, who have no choice but to mix with inmates, are at risk, as are their families and the communities where they live.\n\nIn response, prisons and jails have begun to take measures such as reducing their population, isolating those with symptoms, providing soap and disinfectants, and increasing the frequency of facility cleaning. However, testing remains a significant issue, with too few being tested too seldom.\n\nThe situation has led to prison uprisings, with inmates demanding protection and more information, and corrections officers joining in lawsuits to secure adequate protective equipment, information, and testing.\n\nExperts urge prison officials to speed the release of nonviolent offenders, the elderly, and the vulnerable. Universal testing is considered an imperative, and prisoners need more access to soap and water. Both prisoners and corrections officials need protective gear and information on how to protect themselves.\n\nThe pandemic has once again highlighted the moral outrage of the U.S.'s high incarceration rate, with prisoners disproportionately poor and people of color. Even without the virus, this is a disgrace. Now, the virus is turning incarceration into a potential death sentence. The time for aggressive action is long past, and prisons should be made a priority for supplies, tests, and early release of as many inmates as possible, particularly the elderly and the vulnerable.",
    " Title: Rep. John Conyers Admits Settlement with Former Staffer Amid Sexual Harassment Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), a powerful Democratic lawmaker and the longest-serving House member, admitted Tuesday that he settled a complaint with a former staffer who reportedly claimed she was fired for rejecting his sexual advances.\n\nInitially, Conyers had denied any settlements related to sexual harassment allegations to the Associated Press on Tuesday. However, Conyers' office issued a detailed clarification Tuesday afternoon, acknowledging the complaint was real, though the lawmaker adamantly denied the underlying claims.\n\n\"The Associated Press made an unannounced visit to the home of Congressman Conyers this morning,\" a spokesperson for Conyers said Tuesday. \"Congressman Conyers was under the impression the reporter was speaking of recent allegations of which he was unaware of and denied.\"\n\nConyers, who has served in the House for decades and is the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, stated that he has been a \"fierce advocate for equality in the workplace\" and supports the rights of his employees. However, he noted that the mere making of an allegation does not mean it is true.\n\n\"In this case, I expressly and vehemently denied the allegations made against me and continue to do so,\" Conyers said, adding that his office resolved the allegations. \"That should not be lost in the narrative. The resolution was not for millions of dollars, but rather for an amount that equated to a reasonable severance payment.\"\n\nConyers also stated that he would \"fully cooperate with an investigation\" once the House determines the \"extent\" they will look at \"these issues.\"\n\nThe allegations against Conyers, as reported by BuzzFeed News, include requests for sexual favors, inappropriate touching, and rubbing staff members' hands and legs and backs. The woman who complained about her firing reportedly claimed she was dismissed because she did not \"succumb to [his] sexual advances.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) called the report \"extremely troubling\" in a statement released Tuesday. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she was not aware of the reported settlement involving Conyers.\n\nThe report also stated that the Congressional Office of Compliance did not confirm or deny dealing with the case. The allegations against Conyers are the latest in a series of sexual harassment allegations shaking Capitol Hill in recent days. Similar allegations have been made against Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Senate Republican candidate Roy Moore in Alabama.",
    " Title: Veteran Senator John McCain Diagnosed with Glioblastoma, Vows to Return to Work\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement released by his office, veteran US Senator John McCain has been diagnosed with a brain cancer known as glioblastoma, following a surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye last week. The 80-year-old politician is currently reviewing treatment options, which may include chemotherapy and radiation, according to his doctors.\n\nThe senator, who is known for his tough and independent-minded demeanor, is recovering at home in good spirits. In a tweet, he expressed his gratitude for the outpouring of support and assured his colleagues in Congress that he would be back soon.\n\nThe tumor was discovered during the surgery at a clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, last Friday. Tissue analysis revealed that the clot was associated with a primary brain tumor. A statement from the Mayo Clinic confirmed the diagnosis.\n\nSenior Republicans and Democrats have wished Senator McCain a speedy recovery, prompting him to tweet his thanks and a warning to his sparring partners in Congress.\n\nJohn McCain, a Vietnam veteran and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, is a decorated war hero who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war. He earned his reputation as a warrior, being shot down as a US Navy pilot over Vietnam and enduring more than five years of captivity, including two years in solitary confinement.\n\nDuring the most recent presidential election campaign, Donald Trump belittled the senator as \"not a war hero,\" saying \"I like people who weren't captured.\" Mr. McCain may have annoyed many Republicans by arguing for reforms to campaign finance and immigration laws, and he may have irritated opponents of America's many wars with his forceful arguments in favor of the projection of US military might.\n\nGlioblastoma is a particularly aggressive brain tumor, and its incidence increases with age, affecting more men than women. Senator McCain's family, including his 32-year-old daughter Meghan, has reacted with shock to the news. In a tweet, Meghan said, \"Cancer may afflict him in many ways, but it will not make him surrender. Nothing ever has.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and former President Barack Obama have all expressed their support for Senator McCain, wishing him a speedy recovery. The nation now waits with bated breath as the senator faces this new challenge with the same courage and determination that has defined his life.",
    " Title: Army Warns of Potential Crippling Effects of Sequestration on Ground Forces\n\nThe United States Army is urging active and retired generals to advocate for relief from budget caps, known as sequestration, in Congress, as another round of automatic budget cuts could significantly impact the Army's ability to execute its strategic responsibilities, according to an internal memo obtained by The \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nIn the memo, Maj. Gen. Laura Richardson, the Army's chief of legislative affairs, stated that without relief from sequestration, the Army may soon be unable to meet the requirements outlined in the Defense Strategic Guidance, potentially leading to a \"hollow Army.\" The budget caps, suspended under a bipartisan budget deal, could return in fiscal 2016, beginning on October 1, unless an agreement is reached.\n\nGen. Raymond T. Odierno, the Army's chief of staff and a former top commander in Iraq, has been one of the most vocal military leaders in warning about the potential consequences of another sequestration round. He has made several public statements emphasizing that another round of cuts could come close to breaking the Army.\n\nThe active-duty soldier force peaked at 570,000 during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and is scheduled to shrink to approximately 450,000. However, sequestration poses a threat to further reduce the force to 420,000, a level that Gen. Odierno believes is the absolute minimum for the active force to carry out its strategic responsibilities.\n\nGen. Richardson wrote in the memo that caps on defense spending are having a detrimental impact on the Army, damaging readiness, reducing manpower, and weakening modernization programs. The memo also stated that Gen. Odierno wants all Army general officers to be aware of the impacts of sequestration so they can discuss these issues with members of Congress and their staff during their engagements.\n\nRecent deployments demonstrate a busy U.S. Army, with forces sent to Europe for war games as a warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a deployment to Baghdad to advise the Iraqi Security Forces, soldiers inserted into West Africa to help combat the spread of the Ebola virus, and ground units maintained in Afghanistan.\n\nGen. Odierno recently told a group of defense reporters that the Army may reach a \"breaking point\" if more budget cuts are implemented. He stated that further cuts would force him to reduce purchases of weapons systems needed to modernize the war-weary force. \"As I look at that,\" he said, \"it's end strength, it's modernization, it's readiness. I can't go any faster on end strength, so that means you have to take further reductions in readiness and modernization.\"",
    " Title: Gun-Violence Prevention Organizations Launch Voting Rights Campaign to Amplify Democracy and Combat Gun Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint effort to highlight the connection between gun violence prevention and democracy, the gun-violence prevention organizations March For Our Lives, Brady, and Team Enough have launched a campaign focused on voting rights. The campaign, titled \"Voting Access Saves Lives,\" aims to educate voters on their rights and provide resources to ensure equitable access to the ballot box.\n\nThe groups have released a report, \"Accessing Democracy: A Gun Violence Issue,\" which focuses on four categories: voting by mail and absentee voting, voter registration, early voting, and restoration of voting rights. The report emphasizes that communities historically marginalized by gun violence are often deprived of the avenues of direct democracy and their right to vote.\n\nThe campaign will distribute the report and tool kits to hundreds of March For Our Lives, Brady, and Team Enough chapters, as well as the groups' network of other gun-violence prevention organizations. The tool kits will provide information on polling locations, voter registration, vote-by-mail and absentee voting laws, early voting options, and the status of voting rights for citizens with misdemeanor or felony records.\n\nEach tool kit will also include \"action plans\" for the respective states, such as contacting state officials to expand equitable access to voting, extending in-person early voting, repealing voter ID laws, and supplying personal protective equipment to poll workers. For example, the Arizona tool kit provides citizens with the phone numbers of mayors and city council members in major cities, encouraging them to request personal protective equipment for poll workers.\n\nMaxwell Frost, national organizing director for March For Our Lives, stated, \"When we talk about actions and people getting involved, we're taking a very localized approach in this campaign. We're reaching out to folks who live in these states and asking them to advocate for their own states, for their own democracy reform in the place that they live in.\"\n\nThe Voting Access Saves Lives initiative comes amid protests and calls for racial justice following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in Minnesota after an officer knelt on his neck. The groups emphasize that while gun violence disproportionately affects Black communities, voting rights are often suppressed within those communities as well.\n\nCrystal Cooper, director of communications at March For Our Lives, said, \"If you're a young person who's been on the front lines and protesting and you clearly care about Black lives and racial justice and long-term outcomes, this work within the political system and fixing some of the historic inequities are also part of achieving that goal, and in fact play a major role in achieving that goal. It's the leaders as well, not just the policies, that we're advocating for. We need to make sure that we have the policies in place, the leaders in place.\"\n\nThe coalition believes there is a discrepancy between what Americans want and what they get when it comes to policy, in part because of a flawed electoral system and voter suppression. For example, a majority of people support background checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows, according to the Pew Research Center. However, a bill that would require background checks for all firearms sales\u2014passed in the House last year\u2014has stalled in the Senate.\n\nThe Voting Access Saves Lives coalition is committed to ensuring that communities are able to vote for elected officials who represent them and their beliefs in free and fair elections. Kris Brown, president of Brady, stated, \"The reality for our cause is that unless we ensure that we truly have free and fair elections, much of the work that we're trying to do will remain stalled in certain places.\"\n\nThrough calling for the restoration of voting rights, the coalition aims to make sure all citizens can participate in the electoral process. The campaign is particularly focused on the Black community, which has historically been disproportionately affected by gun violence and voter suppression.\n\nMaxwell Frost, national organizing director for March For Our Lives, noted, \"I'm really excited about this campaign personally because it's specific actions that are going to be helping different communities, you know, specifically the Black community, which is obviously the centerpiece of a national and international movement right now.\" Frost also highlighted the importance of restoring voting rights for formerly incarcerated individuals, citing his own experience working on a constitutional amendment that restored voting rights for most previously convicted felons in Florida.",
    " Title: Analysis Shows Increasing Trend of High Safety Ratings in NHTSA Vehicle Assessments\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has been providing safety ratings for new vehicles since 1978, with the aim of informing consumers about a vehicle's crash protection and rollover safety. The agency awards up to five stars based on various safety measures, and a high rating can serve as a significant government endorsement for automakers.\n\nAn analysis by The Times, using data from car-shopping and research site Edmunds.com, reveals that almost every model has received high marks since 2001. From 2001 to 2010, 87% of all safety ratings were four or five stars.\n\nJohn O' Dell, a senior editor and vehicle safety expert at Edmunds.com, attributes this trend to automakers' increasing understanding of NHTSA's requirements. They have learned to design their cars to excel in the ratings, with a focus on a vehicle's ability to withstand a rollover accident.\n\nIn 2011, the agency introduced new, stricter standards and added an overall safety rating. Despite these changes, the ratings have continued to improve. For models from 2011 to the present, 92% of the overall safety ratings were four or five-star ratings, according to the analysis. The percentage of four and five-star overall ratings increased each year, from 83% for 2011 models to 96% for 2015 models.\n\nHowever, Jack Gillis, a former NHTSA official involved in early efforts to develop a ratings program at the agency and now a publisher of an independent rating, argues that the government is not making full use of this valuable resource. He suggests that presenting the information on a more relative basis could stimulate competition among automakers.",
    " Title: President Obama Addresses National Security Agency Surveillance Concerns, Acknowledges Potential for Abuse\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a candid interview with CNN on Friday, President Barack Obama addressed the ongoing concerns regarding the National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance programs. The President, during a two-day bus tour through upstate New York and Pennsylvania, acknowledged the potential for these programs to be abused if not properly checked.\n\n\"There are legitimate concerns that technology is moving so quickly that, at some point, does the technology outpace the laws that are in place and the protections that are in place?\" Mr. Obama questioned, speaking with CNN's Chris Cuomo. \"Do some of these [surveillance] systems end up being like a loaded gun out there that somebody at some future point could abuse?\"\n\nThe President admitted that the American people are not reassured by his or congressional leaders' assurances that the federal government is not listening to citizens' phone calls or reading their emails. This skepticism has been fueled by recent disclosures that the NSA looked at as many as 56,000 communications of Americans over a three-year period, despite no connection to terrorism.\n\n\"This can only work if the American people trust what's going on,\" Mr. Obama stated. \"People don't have enough information and aren't confident enough that between all of the safeguards and checks we put in place in the executive branch, and the federal court oversight, and the congressional oversight, people are still concerned that their emails are being read... We're going to have to continue to improve the safeguards.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging Americans' fears and concerns, the President expressed confidence that the NSA surveillance programs are not being abused at the current moment. The NSA programs were first revealed by Edward Snowden, the former federal contractor who recently was granted asylum in Russia and is charged by the Justice Department with espionage and other offenses. Snowden is viewed by many civil liberties activists as a hero who exposed the extent of the government's spying on its own people.",
    " Title: Obama Defends Bergdahl Rescue Mission, Addresses Congressional Criticism and National Security Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference in Warsaw, Poland, President Barack Obama defended his administration's efforts to rescue Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from captivity, emphasizing the importance of bringing an American soldier home. The President stated, \"We don't leave our men or women in uniform behind, and that dates back to the earliest days.\"\n\nObama argued that his administration had been consulting with Congress \"for some time\" regarding the possibility of a prisoner swap with the Taliban. However, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) disputed this claim, stating that Congress had not heard from the Obama administration since 2011 on the matter.\n\nThe White House did not inform lawmakers of the deal until after it had been executed, with formal notification coming on Monday, two days after the White House Rose Garden ceremony with Bergdahl's parents.\n\nObama maintained that his administration acted appropriately in seizing the opportunity to free Bergdahl, citing concerns for the soldier's health and the cooperation of Qatar in executing the exchange. Bergdahl has faced criticism for allegedly deserting his post in 2009, but Obama emphasized that the immediate focus is on helping him recover from the stresses of his captivity.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey stated on Facebook that any concerns about Bergdahl's conduct are separate from efforts to recover any U.S. service member in enemy captivity. Dempsey added that Bergdahl is innocent until proven guilty, and that the Army will not ignore misconduct if it occurred.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of Bergdahl facing a court martial for desertion, Obama stated that such discussions are premature, as the priority is ensuring a successful transition for Bergdahl after five years of captivity.\n\nObama also addressed concerns about the release of five Taliban members from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, stating that their release was conditioned on Qatar's monitoring of their activities. He acknowledged the potential for recidivism but expressed confidence in the ability to respond if the released individuals engage in activities harmful to U.S. defenses.",
    " Title: NSA Director Rogers Skeptical of U.S.-Russia Cyber Security Collaboration Amid Ongoing Concerns\n\nIn the picturesque town of ASPEN, Colorado, National Security Agency (NSA) Director Mike Rogers has expressed reservations about the prospect of a U.S.-Russia cyber security collaboration, a proposal that has sparked skepticism from several senior U.S. lawmakers.\n\nThe proposal, which initially seemed to have the support of President Donald Trump, has been met with criticism due to the ongoing investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Russia meddled in the election by hacking Democratic emails and distributing online propaganda to help Trump win over his rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\nMoscow has denied any interference, and Trump has maintained that his campaign did not collude with Russia. This week, a Russian presidential envoy suggested that discussions were underway between the two nations to create a joint cyber security working group.\n\nWhen asked about the feasibility of setting up a cyber security cell with the Russians, Rogers, speaking at the annual Aspen Security Forum, responded, \"I'm not a policy guy here... I would argue now is probably not the best time to be doing this.\"\n\nTrump had earlier this month discussed the idea of creating such a group with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg. However, the proposal has faced criticism from senior Republicans, who question Moscow's trustworthiness. Trump later seemed to back away from the idea, stating on Twitter, \"The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't.\"\n\nThe widespread concern and confusion about the possible cyber working group reflects the Trump administration's struggles to articulate a clear approach to international cyber security issues amid inconsistent statements by the president and ongoing personnel changes.\n\nRogers, however, suggested that such a unit could be a possibility \"were we to see changes in [Russia's] behavior.\" The uncertainty surrounding the proposal underscores the complex and evolving nature of international cyber security relations, particularly between the United States and Russia.",
    " Title: U.S. and Allies Seize Opportunity to Target Islamic State in Kobani, Acknowledge Long-Term Campaign Against ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference on Friday, military and White House officials acknowledged that the ongoing fighting in the Syrian border town of Kobani has created an opportunity to take out large numbers of Islamic State (ISIS) fighters pouring into the battle. While the fighting has raised concerns that the vital town could still fall to ISIS, Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, head of U.S. Central Command, claimed that there is an upside for the U.S. and its allies.\n\nAustin stated, \"The enemy has made a decision to make Kobani his main effort,\" claiming \"manpower\" is streaming into the area. He further asserted, \"Now, my goal is to defeat and ultimately destroy ISIL. And if [the enemy] continues to present us with major targets... then clearly, we'll service those targets, and we've done so very, very effectively here of late.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest echoed the point, stating that ISIS is amassing fighters and resources in Kobani. He explained, \"That has created a rather target-rich environment around Kobani for American and coalition air strikes... it's easier to take them out.\"\n\nHowever, military officials cautioned against expecting quick progress in the overall campaign against ISIS. Austin told a Pentagon news conference, \"The campaign to destroy ISIL will take time, and there will be occasional setbacks along the way.\" He acknowledged \"it's highly possible that Kobani may fall.\"\n\nWhile the U.S. military is hammering the jihadists daily from the air, the U.S. military is talking of a years-long effort, one that will require more than aerial bombardment, will show results only gradually, and may eventually call for a more aggressive use of U.S. military advisers in Iraq.\n\nAustin expressed optimism about the Iraqi government's ability to enlist the support of Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar province to turn the tide in that important region, where the militants have made recent gains. He also stated he sees no imminent threat to the international airport west of Baghdad, where U.S. Apache helicopters are monitoring Islamic State efforts to make inroads on the capital.\n\nAs an example of fresh progress, Austin said Iraqi soldiers on Friday attacked north from Baghdad to Beiji, home to Iraq's largest oil refinery. Yet, the militants are making gains in some parts, like the Sunni-dominated Anbar province, even as they stall or retrench in other areas. Baghdad is not believed to be in imminent danger of falling but it is \"certainly in their sights,\" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said.\n\nThe Pentagon is preparing to set up a more formally organized command structure, known in military parlance as a joint task force, to lead and coordinate the campaign from a forward headquarters, perhaps in Kuwait. On Wednesday, it formally named the campaign \"Operation Inherent Resolve.\"\n\nAs of Thursday, the U.S. had launched nearly 300 airstrikes in Iraq and nearly 200 in Syria, and allies had tallied fewer than 100, according to Central Command. Those figures do not capture the full scope of the effort because many airstrikes launch multiple bombs on multiple targets. Central Command said that as of Wednesday, U.S. and partner-nation air forces had dropped nearly 1,400 munitions.",

The crash resulted in the death of all 65 passengers and six crew members on board, according to official statements.\n\nThe plane was en route to Orsk, approximately 1,000 miles southeast of Moscow, as reported by REN-TV. The Moscow Inter-Regional Transport Prosecutor's Office confirmed the fatalities, stating, \"The plane was carrying 65 passengers and six crewmembers. All of them died.\"\n\nTransport Minister Maxim Sokolov added, \"Judging by everything, no one has survived this crash.\"\n\nAuthorities have recovered a black box from the crash site, and the area has been cordoned off. Sergei Poletykin, the regional head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, reported, \"One recorder was found at the crash site.\"\n\nThe crew of the doomed aircraft did not report any malfunctions, according to Svetlana Petrenko, an official representative of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation. \"At the moment it has been established that there have been no reports of aircraft failure from the crew,\" Petrenko said.\n\nAll passengers aboard the airliner are believed to have been residents of the Orenburg region, along the border with Kazakhstan, as per the Interfax news agency and Sergei Sheremetsinsky, a spokesman for the regional governor.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin postponed a planned trip to Sochi to closely monitor the investigation and offered his condolences to the families of those killed. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated, \"The president expresses deep condolences to all those who lost their relatives and friends in this disaster.\"\n\nPutin was to meet Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas on Monday in the Black Sea resort where the president has an official residence. Instead, Abbas will meet with Putin in Moscow in the latter part of Monday, as per Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\n\nFragments of the jet were found in the Ramenskoye area, about 25 miles from the airport, according to REN-TV. No ground casualties were reported. The flight took off from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport and spent about 5 minutes in the air before a signal was lost about 12 miles southeast of the airport, according to Flightradar24, a flight-tracking website.\n\nThe cause of the crash remains unclear, with weather conditions and pilot error being among the possible reasons. Russia's Investigative Committee is looking into all possible crash causes.\n\nThe plane, an Antonov An-148 jet, was manufactured in both Ukraine and Russia. While it remains to be seen what caused the crash on Sunday, shabby equipment and poor supervision had plagued Russian civil aviation for years after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, but its safety record has improved markedly in recent years.\n\nThis tragic incident follows other significant crashes in Russia, such as the Tu-154 crash on Dec. 25, 2016, and the Boeing 737-800 crash in March 2016. The most recent large-scale crash occurred in October 2015, when a Russian Metrojet airliner was destroyed by an onboard bomb, killing 224 people.",
    " Title: Democratic Recruitment Surges Amidst Fiscal Crises and GOP Troubles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the ongoing fiscal crises that have plagued the U.S. Congress, the House Democrats are experiencing a significant boost in candidate recruitment efforts. The twin fiscal crises, which have taken a toll on the GOP's approval ratings nationwide, are providing a much-needed impetus for Democratic candidates who were previously hesitant or unwilling to run for office.\n\nIn Nebraska, Omaha city councilman Pete Festersen, who had previously declined to run against eight-term incumbent GOP Rep. Lee Terry, has reconsidered his decision following Terry's criticism during the government shutdown. National Democrats view Festersen as a pro-business moderate who could potentially challenge the Republican-friendly 2nd Congressional District.\n\nSimilarly, in New Jersey, attorney Bill Hughes Jr., the son of a popular former congressman, has expressed a likelihood of running against longtime GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo. Indiana Democrat Joe Bock, a University of Notre Dame official, has also announced his intention to run after much deliberation.\n\nSome of the Democratic recruits boast statewide or national profiles. Former FEMA director James Lee Witt is considering running for the seat being vacated by Republican Rep. Tom Cotton. In Florida, Alex Sink, the state's former chief financial officer, is contemplating a run for a seat in the St. Petersburg area.\n\nThe increased number of Democratic candidates offers a glimmer of hope for the party in an election year that has provided few opportunities for success. However, the combination of redistricting and demographics has limited the number of competitive seats in 2014, making it challenging for Democrats to chip away at the GOP's 17-seat majority.\n\nRepublicans are quick to point out that strong recruits are not a guarantee of success in red districts. Andrea Bozek, a National Republican Congressional Committee spokeswoman, stated, \"It's going to be difficult for these second-tier Democrat candidates to run as outsiders in Republican districts when President Obama and Harry Reid are leading their party and running Washington.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, the new recruits provide at least a glimmer of hope for the Democrats in an election year that has given them little reason for optimism. The fiscal crises have pushed many potential candidates, such as Festersen, Hughes, and Bock, to reconsider their decisions to run. The shutdown and debt standoff have also spurred other Democratic candidates, such as Aimee Belgard in New Jersey and Patrick Henry Hays in Arkansas, to contemplate challenging their respective GOP representatives.\n\nThe mess in Washington has made the sales pitches from the Democratic National Committee more compelling, with candidates such as Festersen and Witt being personally contacted by Vice President Joe Biden in an effort to secure their candidacy. The fiscal crises have crystallized the need for action, with candidates such as Hughes stating, \"Whereas before it was, 'I don't know. Let's think about it.' Now it's, 'Let's do something.'\"",
    " Title: Attorney General Sessions' Alleged Misrepresentation of Russian Contacts Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent report by Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, and Greg Miller for the Washington Post, it has been alleged that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, under oath during his confirmation hearing, may have misrepresented his interactions with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.\n\nAccording to the report, Sessions, in fact, spoke with Kislyak on two occasions, including, as reported by the Post, \"at the height of what U.S. intelligence officials say was a Russian cyber campaign to upend the U.S. presidential race.\" This contradicts Sessions' statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, where he stated that he was not aware of any such activities and had not communicated with Russians during the 2016 campaign.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, asked Sessions about any evidence of communication between individuals affiliated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Sessions responded, \"I'm not aware of any of those activities,\" and added, \"I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.\"\n\nThe allegation that Sessions lied to Franken, if the Washington Post report is accurate, has sparked debate and controversy. Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of the blog Lawfare, suggested on Twitter that there may not be enough evidence for a perjury charge. Wittes argued that there is ambiguity about whether Sessions, at his hearing, meant he had no communication with Russia as part of his work as a campaign surrogate versus his work as a senator. If he was speaking exclusively about his work on behalf of the campaign, Sessions could argue that his work as a US senator was a separate matter.\n\nSessions' spokesperson, Sarah Isgur Flores, and Sessions himself have denied any wrongdoing. In a statement, Sessions said, \"I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.\" Sessions' spokesperson and his own statement only deny that he spoke with Russian officials as a campaign surrogate, but he still apparently communicated with a Russian official as a senator.\n\nThe Post report suggests that Sessions' contact with Kislyak, even as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee at the time, was unusual. Among the 20 (of 26) members of the committee who responded to the Post, none of them met with Russia's ambassador last year.\n\nThe allegations against Sessions are the latest in a string of controversies surrounding the Trump administration's ties to Russia. Last month, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign after it was revealed that he talked to Kislyak in December and may have suggested that Trump would lift sanctions against Russia\u2014a potential violation of the Logan Act, which bans people outside the executive branch from making foreign policy on behalf of the U.S. administration. (Flynn and Trump were not in office at the time of the call.)\n\nIn response to the report, Democrats have called on Sessions to recuse himself from any investigation into Trump's ties to the Justice Department. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called on Sessions to resign, stating, \"After lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the attorney general must resign. Sessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country and must resign. There must be an independent, bipartisan, outside commission to investigate the Trump political, personal, and financial connections to the Russians.\"\n\nFor more information on the growing Trump-Russia scandal, read \u2588\u2588\u2588's explainer.",
    " Title: Trump's Gun Control Proposals Face Skepticism as Washington Returns to Business as Usual\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the nation grapples with the aftermath of the Florida school shooting that left 17 dead, the push for gun law reform has gained momentum, with students who survived the tragedy leading the charge. However, as lawmakers returned to Washington this week, it appears that political realities on the Second Amendment remain as strong as ever.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has promised to \"turn our grief into action,\" pledging to outlaw bump fire stocks and to \"harden\" U.S. schools to protect them from shooters. He has also expressed support for \"strong\" background checks to prevent \"sickos\" from obtaining guns.\n\nHowever, there is skepticism that any significant change in gun laws will be achieved in Congress, where pro-Second Amendment Republicans hold a majority. The White House is reportedly looking at expanding background checks to gun show sales and making them more efficient, as well as including private transactions.\n\nTrump's call for raising the age that someone can buy a long gun from 18 to 21 has reportedly been put on hold, and there is little political support on Capitol Hill for the idea of returning mental institutions to address the issue of mass shootings.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for more action, but has given no indication that he is ready to expose senators up for re-election this year to tough votes on measures that would ban assault-style weapons. Some Republicans have signaled that hopes of raising the required age for purchasing long guns and even banning bump stocks are unlikely to be realized.\n\nSenators Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) have attempted to forge a way forward for their bill on universal background checks, which failed to pass in 2013 after the Sandy Hook school massacre. Manchin expressed hope that the presence of a Republican in the White House could reassure some GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe White House has announced that Trump will meet with lawmakers on Wednesday to try to forge a way forward, and meetings of Republican caucus members on Tuesday will be closely watched to see whether there is any change in the political weather on guns. However, early evidence on Capitol Hill suggests it will be tough to pass anything much stronger than the Fix NICS bill, which would require states and agencies to do more to include records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.",
    " Title: Hong Kong Government Fully Withdraws Extradition Bill, Protesters Call Move \"Too Little, Too Late\"\n\nArticle:\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced on Wednesday that the government would fully withdraw the controversial extradition bill from the legislature, addressing one of the five demands protesters have been advocating for since June. The bill, which would have allowed the Communist Party of China to extradite individuals accused of violating communist \"crimes\" into the Chinese prison system, has sparked widespread fear among Hong Kong residents due to China's notorious human rights violations.\n\nIn a public address, Lam stated that the Legislative Council would fully withdraw the bill \"in order to fully allay public concerns.\" She also acknowledged the violence that has engulfed the city, blaming both the peaceful protest movement and the police for the unrest.\n\n\"Our citizens, police, and reporters have been injured during violent incidents. There have been chaotic scenes at the airport and MTR stations; roads and tunnels have been suddenly blocked, causing delay and inconvenience to daily life,\" Lam said. \"For many people, Hong Kong has become an unfamiliar place.\"\n\nLam also announced modifications to the membership of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, a move that addresses one of the remaining demands for an independent inquiry on police brutality. However, concerns remain that the police will exonerate themselves of human rights crimes if they conduct the investigation.\n\nThe Global Times, a Chinese regime propaganda outlet, warned that Lam's move should not be seen as a concession that could lead to a \"slippery slope,\" and that radical forces should not have any illusion of winning ground on matters related to the \"one country, two systems\" principle that governs Hong Kong and China's sovereignty.\n\nThe protesters have made five demands on Hong Kong's government: a withdrawal of the extradition bill, an independent inquiry on police brutality, freedom for political prisoners, direct election of lawmakers, and an apology for labeling the June 12 protest a \"riot.\"\n\nPrior to Wednesday, Lam had adamantly refused to withdraw the extradition bill, stating that legislators had tabled it and declaring it \"dead\" in July. However, tabling a bill keeps it alive and allows lawmakers to revive it at any time.\n\nProtest movement leaders have criticized Lam's previous statements, asserting that \"dead\" is not a legal term for a bill and that she gave no guarantees lawmakers would not bring it back to life.\n\nThe announcement follows the destruction of the Legislative Council floor and much of the building it uses as its headquarters. Protesters meticulously destroyed all the technology and every facility used to pass laws, but left historical documents, the building's cafeteria, and other irrelevant areas untouched.\n\nLam's concession comes after the publication of a bombshell report this week by Reuters, revealing audio of the chief executive saying she would like to resign from the post, but is not allowed. In the audio, Lam is heard saying, \"For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable. It's just unforgivable.\"\n\nLam conceded on Tuesday that the audio is real, but claimed that her choice of words was taken out of context, and that she meant only that quitting was the easiest thing to do. Despite Lam admitting the audio was, indeed, of her voice, the Global Times called the Reuters report \"fake,\" without elaborating.\n\nProtest leaders have called Lam's withdrawal of the bill \"too little and too late,\" insisting they will continue their struggle for freedom from China.",
    " Title: South Korea, North Korea Agree to Dialogue and Summit Talks, as U.S. Remains Cautious Amidst North Korea's Denuclearization Pledge\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, North Korea has expressed a willingness to hold talks with the United States on denuclearization and has pledged not to use nuclear or conventional weapons against Seoul. This announcement was made by South Korea's presidential national security director, Chung Eui-yong, following his two-day visit to North Korea.\n\nPresident Trump, in a tweet hours after Chung's statement, expressed cautious optimism, stating, \"Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting!\"\n\nChung's statement detailed that North Korea has committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and will not engage in strategic provocations such as nuclear and ballistic missile tests while dialogue continues. The two Koreas have agreed to hold summit talks in April at the border, and to establish a \"hotline\" communication channel to lower military tensions.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, however, called for countries to further isolate North Korea despite the regime's offer to discuss denuclearization. Tillerson emphasized that North Korea poses a threat to the global community through its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs and proliferation activities.\n\nThe recent thaw in relations between North and South Korea can be traced back to last month's Pyeongchang Olympics, where the two Koreas held their first talks in years. North Korea sent a delegation to the Olympics, including Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, who met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\nHowever, the phrase \"unification\" used by Kim Yo Jong in a guest book at South Korea's presidential office carries a far more sinister connotation for the Kim family and the regime. In Pyongyang's view, \"unification\" signifies the Kim dynasty's brutal dictatorship overcoming the South's government.\n\nAs North Korea's hard currency is expected to run dry by October, according to a South Korean lawmaker, the international community will continue to closely watch developments on the Korean Peninsula.",
    " Title: Tulsi Gabbard and Hillary Clinton Exchange Heated Words on Social Media\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard took aim at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, following Clinton's suggestion that Gabbard is a \"favorite of the Russians.\"\n\nClinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, made the comment during an episode of the podcast \"Campaign HQ,\" hosted by David Plouffe, who was the campaign manager for former President Obama's 2008 campaign. Clinton did not mention Gabbard by name, but it was clear that she was referring to the Hawaii congresswoman, who has repeatedly denied accusations of being a Russian asset.\n\nGabbard, a member of the Hawaii National Guard and an Iraq War veteran, responded with a series of tweets, calling Clinton the \"embodiment of corruption\" among the Democratic Party establishment.\n\n\"From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation,\" Gabbard tweeted. \"We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you.\"\n\nGabbard also challenged Clinton to \"join the race directly\" if she was going to attack her.\n\n\"It's now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly,\" Gabbard tweeted.\n\nGabbard's tweeted attack on Clinton left fellow Democratic 2020 candidate Sen. Cory Booker speechless. According to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Gabbard is polling at 1.2 percent nationally, making her one of the lower-tier candidates to make this week's primary debate in Ohio.\n\nGabbard's campaign has faced ongoing concern from political observers that her campaign is being amplified by Russian bots and online trolls. She has raised eyebrows with her anti-establishment foreign policy positions, especially her accusation that the U.S. engages in regime-change wars and her meeting with Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2017.",
    " Title: Iran Denies Reports of Downing Civilian Plane, Invites International Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Iranian officials have denied reports from American and European intelligence agencies that Iran shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, which was en route from Tehran to Kyiv on January 8, 2020.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, the plane was reportedly brought down by an anti-aircraft missile battery. President Trump suggested on Thursday that the incident may have been an error, stating, \"Somebody could have made a mistake on the other side.\"\n\nHowever, Iran aviation department head Ali Abedzadeh stated at the press conference, \"What is obvious for us, and what we can say with certainty, is that no missile hit the plane.\" Abedzadeh also invited officials from Boeing to join the investigation.\n\nHassan Rezaeifar, the head of the Iranian investigative team, stated that Iran would not share the aircraft's black box flight recorders until the country had completed a study of them. The team may reach out to international experts if it is unable to extract the recordings, but the investigation could take over a month to fully retrieve the black box data. After that, the investigation itself could continue for up to a year.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed that Canada intelligence believed the crash was caused by a missile strike. At least 63 Canadian citizens were on board the aircraft.\n\n\"The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile,\" Trudeau said on Thursday.\n\nIn total, 176 people died in the crash, mostly Iranian and Canadian citizens. While Ukraine International Airlines has yet to comment on the incident, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his country \"will conduct a detailed and independent investigation\" into the crash.",
    " Title: Trump's Resilience in Republican Primary: A Force to Reckon With\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump's rise and resilience is a unique phenomenon in modern American political history. Despite a few temporary setbacks, Trump maintains a dominant position in the Republican primary race, as demonstrated by his recent triumph in New York and his leads in the upcoming primary elections in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.\n\nWith the New York primary results and the upcoming five states' votes, Trump is expected to secure an overwhelming share of the 267 delegates, bringing him less than 100 votes shy of the 1,237 delegates required to take the nomination outright.\n\nTed Cruz, despite his efforts, may struggle to catch up. Cruz could potentially win Pennsylvania, where 54 of the total 71 delegates are not bound, and where the senator is doing well in the delegate selection process. Alternatively, Cruz could win Indiana's 57 votes and Nebraska's 36. However, even with these victories and strong performances in the far West, Cruz may not be able to block Trump and win on the second ballot.\n\nTrump's grip on the Republican primary voter is unparalleled. Despite a 75 percent negative rating among American women, there is little gender gap in his primary vote. He performs as well among Republican women as he does with Republican men.\n\nThe Republican Party's victory in the 2004 election was achieved by bringing 10 million more (largely white) voters out than in 2000. Barack Obama won in 2008 by bringing out 10 million more blacks, Latinos, and young people than in 2004. Mitt Romney lost, in part, because 10 million white voters stayed home in 2012. Trump's primary performances suggest he has the ability to get these voters back, driving Republican turnout to a level 75 percent higher than in 2012.\n\nHowever, Trump faces a 10-point challenge in the general election. He runs 10 points worse among women against Hillary Clinton, is 10 points less favorable and 10 points more unfavorable than Clinton, and loses to her by 10 points in the RealClearPolitics average.\n\nDespite these challenges, Trump's opposition to trade deals and his refusal to take super-PAC money could potentially rally voters, including those of Bernie Sanders, who have similar views on these issues. The impact of the FBI investigation into Clinton's State emails and the release of the Benghazi report remains to be seen.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's ability to get his voters out and hold their support in the face of his terrible national general election numbers is a question mark. However, his resilience in the primary race and his vote-getting power suggest he could still emerge victorious in the general election.",
    " Title: Reflecting on the 19-Year Anniversary of 9/11: A Nation Changed, a War Unending\n\nArticle:\n\nSeptember 11, 2001, remains a searing memory for many Americans, a day that marked a significant turning point in the nation's history. The images of the Twin Towers on fire, the Pentagon hit, and the horror of Flight 93 are indelible, serving as a stark reminder of the global jihad that continues to this day.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, the nation was plunged into a state of shock and silence. The Houston suburbs, like many other communities, were left hushed, with roads empty and work coming to a standstill. The skies were devoid of planes, and citizens clung to their loved ones, wondering about the fate of those lost and if this was just the beginning of more attacks.\n\nThe events of 9/11 marked the beginning of a new and different kind of war, a war that Americans never asked for but answered to avoid further pain on home soil. Too much blood had been spilled in the homeland.\n\nSince then, the landscape of America has changed. Petty insults have become a part of daily life, from the removal of shoes and travel-size toiletries to standing in line for pat-downs by security personnel who often miss obvious threats. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is a tangible reminder of the increased security measures, yet it has not stopped a single terrorist.\n\nThe threat of terrorism remains, with constant reminders in the form of attacks in cities like San Bernardino, Orlando, Nice, Paris, Ansbach, and Istanbul. Each instance, even with heightened security, elicits the same response: shock, disbelief, outrage, horror. Change social media avatars, go on living\u2014the cycle continues.\n\nFifteen years later, it seems appropriate to reassess the trade-offs made in the intervening years. Questions about the effectiveness of mass surveillance, the balance between security and privacy, and the compatibility of Islamic beliefs with Western-style democracy arise. The war on terrorism, a long and ongoing conflict, has led to the creation of a vast bureaucracy, yet it seems cumbersome and inadequate in the face of continued terrorist attacks.\n\nThe question of what America should do moving forward is complex. Should the nation continue to engage in foreign conflicts, or should it withdraw and focus on securing its own borders? How do we handle massive immigration, and what happens if America withdraws or stays involved? What are the consequences of more subtle forms of terrorism, such as an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) attack or disruptions to the electric grid?\n\nThe war on terrorism, a war without battlefields or beachheads, has been long and difficult to sustain. Yet, the nation perseveres, fighting to protect its freedoms both within and without the Republic. The terrorists did not win on 9/11, but they have changed America, leaving the nation with a duality: attempting to retain freedom while protecting that freedom through means that infringe upon it.\n\nIn a Pentagon briefing on September 25, 2001, Douglas Waller of Time magazine reported that President George W. Bush acknowledged the challenges of sustaining a war. \"Wars are easy to start,\" Bush said, \"but they can be difficult to sustain.\" He has been managing expectations, pressing the case that this will be a long war against terrorism.\n\nThe war has been long, indeed. It has been a war without battlefields or beachheads. Fifteen years later, it still wages, and there are no signs of it ending. The monuments are built while the desire to forget is strong. We can't, though.\n\nSo, the country slogs forward, living with a duality: attempting to retain freedom while protecting that freedom through ways that infringe upon it. The terrorists did not win on 9/11. Yet, America is not the same. Her shiny innocence has been lost, and she faces a tireless enemy who continually tries her good nature.",

Vinneccy stated that Swetnick never mentioned her Kavanaugh claims to him and was known for wanting to be the center of attention.\n\n\"She was exaggerating everything. Everything that came out of her mouth was just exaggerations,\" Vinneccy said.\n\nThis is not the only controversy surrounding Swetnick. In a sworn statement last month, she claimed she had seen Kavanaugh \"engage in abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls\" and was a victim of a gang rape at a party where Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were present. However, in an interview with NBC News, she appeared to walk back some of these claims, while standing by her claims of sexually aggressive behavior.\n\nSwetnick's shifting and uncorroborated claims have led to questions about her credibility. NBC News has not been able to independently verify her claims, and she has struggled to provide corroborating witnesses. Swetnick provided four names to NBC News to back up her story, but one is dead, two did not respond to NBC requests, and one other said he didn't remember Swetnick and didn't think he had socialized with her.\n\nSwetnick's ex-boyfriend's allegations add to the mounting questions about her credibility. The FBI is currently conducting a background investigation into sexual assault claims made against Kavanaugh. The agency is expected to wrap up its investigation by Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, it was revealed this week that Swetnick was sued in 2000 by her former employer, Portland-based Webtrends, for allegedly falsifying her educational background and concocting false sexual harassment allegations. The suit, which was voluntarily dismissed by Webtrends shortly afterwards, has been called \"bogus\" by Swetnick's current lawyer, Michael Avenatti.\n\nSwetnick's legal history is not limited to this case. The Associated Press reported on Sunday that Swetnick has been involved in at least six legal cases in the last 25 years. Avenatti told The Associated Press that court cases involving her have no bearing on the credibility of her claims about Kavanaugh.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Swetnick's allegations and her credibility continues to unfold as the Senate Judiciary Committee prepares to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination.",
    " Title: Trump's Path to Republican Nomination: A Look at the Numbers\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The prospect of a contested Republican convention this summer may not be as likely as some political enthusiasts anticipate. While it is still possible for Donald Trump to secure the nomination before the July convention in Cleveland, his path is narrow and precarious.\n\nTrump is the only candidate with a realistic chance of reaching the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the convention. His rivals, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, can only hope to delay him.\n\nIf Cruz and Kasich are successful, political observers across the country will be treated to a convention with an uncertain outcome. However, Trump can put an end to such dreams, and he can do so without any of the 150 or so delegates who will go to the convention free to support the candidate of their choice.\n\nTrump's path to the nomination outright on June 7 is not a prediction, but rather, a plausible scenario. To be sure, Trump will have to significantly improve his performance. He currently has 744 delegates.\n\nNew York, with 95 delegates at stake, is crucial for Trump. He starts Tuesday with a home-state advantage, and a big victory there could propel him closer to the nomination. If Trump wins a majority of the state's delegates, he could take 77 delegates on the night.\n\nFive states hold primaries on April 26, with 172 delegates at stake: Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, and Rhode Island. Trump will need to perform well in these states to secure the remaining delegates he needs.\n\nIn all, it's a day on which Trump could claim 93 delegates. The remaining contests in May and June will determine whether Trump can clinch the nomination before the convention.",
    " Title: NSA Director Denies Allegations of Massive Phone Data Collection in Europe, Addresses Ongoing Spying Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated congressional hearing on Tuesday, the head of the National Security Agency (NSA), Gen. Keith Alexander, adamantly denied recent reports that his agency is collecting millions of phone records across Europe. The hearing, which aimed to discuss proposed reforms to the NSA's bulk collection of communications under the Foreign Intelligence Security Act (FISA), was marked by allegations of spying on friendly countries' leaders and a heated exchange over the extent of such practices.\n\nDuring the hearing, NSA Director Gen. Alexander stated that reports of the US gathering information on tens of millions of phone calls in France and Spain were \"completely false.\" The comment was one of the highlights of the hearing, which took place amid an international uproar over reports last week that the NSA monitored the cellphone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel for a decade \u2013 part of a pattern of the agency eavesdropping on friendly countries' leaders.\n\nOfficials at the hearing did not deny that such spying takes place. Instead, their answers cast doubt on White House assertions that President Obama did not know the extent of the spying on Chancellor Merkel. When asked by Chairman Mike Rogers (R-MI) if the US would consider it important to get access to the communications of foreign leaders, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper responded that knowing \"leadership intentions\" was \"one of the first things I learned in intelligence school in 1963.\"\n\nWhen asked further if America's allies \"conduct espionage on us,\" Mr. Clapper responded \"absolutely\" \u2013 before summarizing that the uproar over friends-on-friends spying reminded him of a scene from the movie \"Casablanca.\"\n\n\"My God, there's gambling going on here,\" Clapper said, offering his own version of the famous line in which a policeman expresses \"shock\" at finding gambling in the movie's snazzy club and gambling den. \"It's the same sort of thing.\"\n\nAs for the \"false\" reports of the NSA gathering millions of European phone records, General Alexander said that the data in question \u2013 part of documents divulged by Edward Snowden to European media \u2013 were actually collected by foreign intelligence agencies. Moreover, to a large extent, they were gathered outside of Europe, often in war zones of crucial security interest to the US and its European allies.\n\n\"This is not information we collected on European citizens,\" Alexander said, defining it instead as \"information that we and our NATO allies have collected in defense of our countries and in support of military operations.\"\n\nThe documents Mr. Snowden provided European media were actually screenshots of data and were not the documents themselves, Alexander said. Some committee members asked why European leaders would offer such harsh judgments of US intelligence practices if their services are doing the same thing.\n\nSome European parliamentarians and policymakers \"may not have familiarity with exactly how their intelligence operations work,\" Clapper said, adding that officials are often unaware of \"everything\" their own intelligence agencies do.\n\nThe uproar over US intelligence practices overshadowed the purpose of Tuesday's hearing, which was to discuss proposed reforms to the NSA's program for bulk collection of communications under the FISA. One proposal from a bipartisan group of House and Senate members would effectively discontinue the program, while an opposing bipartisan collection of lawmakers would keep the program intact while focusing on strengthening its privacy protections.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, said the program \"allows the government to connect the dots\" of brewing terrorist activities. \"I shudder to think what would happen if the program were completely eliminated,\" he said.\n\nBut he added that \"FISA must be reformed\" to increase \"transparency\" and \"privacy protections\" if the government wants to \"restore the public's confidence\" in national intelligence activities.\n\nNSA's Alexander said the record offers proof that the US intelligence community is getting things right. Contrasting a tally of more than 2,300 deaths overseas last year in terrorist attacks with the absence of any \"mass casualty\" attack in the US since 9/11, he said, \"That's not by luck.\"\n\nBut Alexander also said the door was open to improving both the NSA's operations and its protections of civil liberties and privacy. \"We're doing the right things,\" he said, \"but that doesn't mean we shouldn't change.\"",
    " Title: Ben Carson Endorses Donald Trump as Republican Presidential Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, retired neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate Ben Carson has officially endorsed Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president. The announcement was made at Mar-a-Largo, Trump's luxury club in Palm Beach, on Friday.\n\nCarson, who withdrew from the race last week, expressed his support for Trump during a press conference, stating, \"I have found that, in talking with him, that there's a lot more alignment philosophically and spiritually than I ever thought there was.\"\n\nWhen asked about his decision, Carson responded, \"It's about 'we the people.' We need to empower the people.\" He further elaborated, \"That is not going to be done through politics as usual, be that Republican politics as usual, or be that Democrat politics as usual.\"\n\nCarson explained his endorsement of Trump as a need for an \"iconoclast\" who can listen and make wise decisions. He referred to Trump's ability to understand and implement policies that benefit everyone, not just specific groups.\n\nThursday night's GOP presidential debate saw Trump and Carson discussing education and improving schools. Reports from the Washington Post suggest that Carson and Trump met in Palm Beach earlier Thursday and reached an agreement.\n\nCarson had reportedly been torn between Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, but opted to support Trump due to a rumor circulated by the Cruz campaign ahead of the Iowa caucuses that Carson had dropped out of the race.\n\nIn a Thursday interview with Fox News Radio's \"John Gibson Show,\" Carson was asked about joining the Trump campaign. He responded, \"Let's put it this way, I'm certainly leaning [towards joining the campaign].\" He added that there are \"two Donald Trumps\" - the one seen on television and the one he's gotten to know behind the scenes.\n\nCarson concluded the interview by expressing his hope to bridge the gap and work towards policies that benefit all Americans, creating an equal playing field and equality of opportunity.",
    " Title: Ross Perot, Self-made Billionaire and Former Presidential Candidate, Dies at 89\n\nIn a statement released by family spokesman James Fuller, Ross Perot, the self-made billionaire and former presidential candidate, has passed away at the age of 89 after a five-month battle with leukemia. Perot, who made his billions by founding Electronic Data Systems Corp., died early Tuesday at his home in Dallas surrounded by his family.\n\nPerot, a native-born Texan, was seen by admirers as a patriot who served his country well before his two failed bids for the White House. In 1979, he financed a private commando raid to free two EDS employees being held in a prison in Iran. He was also a tireless advocate for Vietnam veterans.\n\nIn 1992, Perot spent more than $60 million of his own money to run against incumbent President George H.W. Bush and challenger Bill Clinton, promising to bring his business acumen to the nation's finances. He won 19 percent of the vote as a third-party candidate, pulling the largest percentage of votes for a third-party candidate since former President Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 bid.\n\nPerot's second campaign four years later fizzled, as he gathered just 8 percent of the vote, and the Reform Party that he founded and hoped to build into a national political force began to fall apart. However, Perot's ideas on trade and deficit reduction remained part of the political landscape. He blamed both major parties for running up a huge federal budget deficit and letting American jobs to be sent to other countries. The movement of U.S. jobs to Mexico, he said, created a \"giant sucking sound.\"\n\nPerot continued to speak out about federal spending for many years. In 2008, he launched a website to highlight the nation's debt with a ticker that tracked the rising total, a blog, and a chart presentation.\n\nBorn in Texarkana on June 27, 1930, Perot's father was a cotton broker, and his mother was a secretary. Perot said his family survived the Depression relatively well through hard work and by managing their money carefully. Young Perot's first job was delivering papers in a poor, mostly black part of town from his pony, Miss Bee. Perot said when the newspaper tried to cut his commission, he complained to the publisher\u2014and won. He said he learned to take problems straight to the top.\n\nFrom Texarkana, Perot went to the U.S. Naval Academy even though he had never been on a ship or seen the ocean. After the Navy, Perot joined International Business Machines in 1955 and quickly became a top salesman. In his last year at IBM, he filled his sales quota for the year in January.\n\nIn 1962, with $1,000 from his wife, Margot, Perot founded Electronic Data Systems. Hardware accounted for about 80% of the computer business, Perot said, and IBM wasn't interested in the other 20%, including services. Many of the early hires at EDS were former military men, and they had to abide by Perot's strict dress code\u2014white shirts, ties, no beards or mustaches\u2014and long work days. Many had crew cuts, like Perot.\n\nThe company's big break came in the mid-1960s when the federal government created Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs for seniors, the disabled, and the poor. States needed help in running the programs, and EDS won contracts\u2014starting in Texas\u2014to handle the millions of claims. EDS first sold stock to the public in 1968, and overnight, Perot was worth $350 million. His fortune doubled and tripled as the stock price rose steadily.\n\nIn 1984, he sold control of the company to General Motors Corp. for $2.5 billion and received $700 million in a buyout. In 2008, EDS was sold to Hewlett-Packard Co. Perot went on to establish another computer-services company, Perot Systems Corp. He retired as CEO in 2000 and was succeeded by his son, Ross Perot Jr. In 2009, Dell Inc. bought Perot Systems.\n\nIn September 2011, Forbes magazine estimated Perot's wealth at $3.5 billion and ranked him No. 91 on its list of richest Americans. Perot's legacy will be remembered as a self-made billionaire who made a significant impact on American politics and business.",
    " Title: Trump Threatens to Close Southern Border, Cut Aid, and Alter Trade Relations with Mexico Over Border Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, President Donald Trump threatened to close the southern border entirely if Congress does not agree to fund his proposed border wall. The tweets came as the ongoing government shutdown, now in its second week, continues to stalemate over funding for the wall.\n\nTrump's tweets demanded $5 billion for the border wall, but Democrats have offered $1.3 billion for general border security. With both sides refusing to budge, there are no signs of the impasse ending anytime soon. One member of the House Republican leadership told reporters on Thursday that a resolution may not emerge until the new year.\n\nIn addition to renewing his demands for the wall, Trump threatened numerous consequences in the absence of the funding. He suggested pulling back on the recently renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which now goes by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\n\"The United States loses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a 'profit making operation,'\" Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump also threatened to terminate aid to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, which he said are doing \"nothing for the United States but taking our money.\" He referred to reports that another caravan of migrants hoping to reach the U.S. is planning to leave Honduras in January.\n\n\"Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!\" Trump said.\n\nTrump has previously threatened to shut down the border and cut aid to countries that do not assist in stopping caravans. However, he took no action following those threats. Earlier this month, the U.S. pledged a total of $10.6 billion in aid and investment for Central America and southern Mexico as part of a push to promote better security and job opportunities to reduce emigration to the U.S.\n\nA cut-off of trade relations with Mexico could also risk a new agreement that DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced this month, which calls for immigrants claiming asylum in the U.S. to be returned to Mexico as their cases are processed.\n\nMick Mulvaney, Trump's incoming acting chief of staff, claimed on \"Fox & Friends\" on Friday that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is interested in a deal but Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi is preventing it. He alleged that Democrats are not negotiating because Pelosi is waiting until she secures the speakership.\n\nHowever, Pelosi has denied claims that Democrats have not provided a counteroffer.\n\n\"Democrats have offered Republicans three options to re-open government that all include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security - but not the President's immoral, ineffective, and expensive wall,\" said Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff. \"With the House Majority, Democrats will act swiftly to end the Trump Shutdown, and will fight for a strategic, robust national security policy, including strong and smart border security, and strong support for our servicemembers and veterans.\"",
    " Title: House Oversight Committee Accuses President Trump of Obstruction as He Orders Federal Employees to Ignore Congressional Subpoenas\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic chairman of the U.S. House Oversight Committee on Wednesday accused President Donald Trump of a \"precedent-setting and growing pattern of obstruction\" after he ordered federal employees not to comply with congressional investigations.\n\nThe Republican president has directed officials not to obey legal requests from the Democratic-led House of Representatives, which is carrying out multiple investigations of his administration, including his tax returns, White House security clearances, and the probe of Russian interference in U.S. politics.\n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement that Trump and Attorney General William Barr are \"openly ordering federal employees to ignore congressional subpoenas and simply not show up - without any assertion of a valid legal privilege.\"\n\nCummings warned federal employees to \"think very carefully about their own legal interests\" in refusing to comply with the panel's requests. The president has vowed to resist every subpoena from House Democrats investigating his administration and to fight any effort by them to impeach him.\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit earlier this week to prevent material from being turned over to lawmakers, and on Wednesday, the Justice Department rebuffed a House committee's request for an interview with an official involved in the administration's decision to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.\n\nThe department said John Gore, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Civil Rights Division, would not participate in a deposition scheduled for Thursday if he could not have a Justice Department lawyer at his side. The committee had offered to allow a lawyer to sit in a different room.\n\nCummings said the committee would gather to hear Gore's deposition on Thursday and suggested he \"should be well aware of his constitutional, legal, and ethical obligations to comply with a duly authorized subpoena from Congress.\"\n\nA Department of Justice (DOJ) official said the committee had provided \"no legitimate or constitutional basis for excluding a DOJ lawyer from assisting at the deposition.\"\n\n\"If a DOJ lawyer may appear to protect privileged subjects, then the Attorney General will allow the deposition to go forward,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump has promised to fight all the way to the Supreme Court against any effort by congressional Democrats to impeach him, even though the U.S. Constitution gives Congress complete authority over the impeachment process. Under the Constitution, Congress is a co-equal branch of government alongside the executive branch and the judiciary.\n\nBut Trump has increasingly accused Democrats of conducting the Russia investigation for purely political purposes ahead of the 2020 election. He has stepped up those accusations since the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nDemocrats remain divided on whether to proceed with an impeachment of Trump after the Russia inquiry. Trump defiantly proclaimed on Twitter that the investigation \"didn't lay a glove on me.\"\n\nIn an opinion piece in the Washington Post, Hillary Clinton, the Democrat whom Trump defeated in 2016, urged members of both parties to follow the facts, whether they lead to \"the eventual filing of articles of impeachment, or not.\"\n\n\"Either way, the nation's interests will be best served by putting party and political considerations aside and being deliberate, fair, and fearless,\" Clinton wrote.\n\nMueller's findings, released in a redacted report last week, detailed how Trump often tried to impede the inquiry but it stopped short of concluding he had committed the crime of obstruction of justice. The report said Congress could address whether the president violated the law.\n\nMueller separately found insufficient evidence to conclude that Trump's campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders have remained cautious over launching impeachment proceedings against Trump ahead of the 2020 election, although they have left the door open to such action. Others in the party's more liberal wing have demanded impeachment proceedings.\n\nBut Democrats have vowed to move ahead full steam with their investigations of Trump, which could produce more evidence that could be used in an impeachment proceeding.\n\nThe Constitution empowers Congress to remove a president from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" The House is given the power to impeach a president - bring formal charges - and the Senate then convenes a trial, with the senators as jurors. A two-thirds vote is needed to convict a president and remove him from office.\n\nThe Constitution gives no role to the Supreme Court in impeachment, though it does assign the chief justice the task of presiding over the Senate trial. Conservative John Roberts currently serves as chief justice.\n\nThat would not preclude Trump from proceeding with litigation to tie up the issue in the courts, despite Supreme Court precedent upholding congressional impeachment power. In 1993, the nation's top court ruled 9-0 in a case involving an impeached U.S. judge that the judiciary has no role in the impeachment process.\n\nLaurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard who has been critical of Trump, said the U.S. founding fathers had considered but ultimately scrapped the idea of allowing the Supreme Court to have any role in the impeachment process.\n\n\"Not even a SCOTUS filled with Trump appointees would get in the way of the House or Senate,\" Tribe said in a series of tweets on Wednesday.",
    " Title: House Democrats Unveil Report Detailing Alleged Illegal Efforts to Sell Nuclear Technology to Saudi Arabia\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a new report released on Tuesday, the House Oversight and Reform Committee has revealed disturbing details about a secretive attempt by top Trump administration officials to sell sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, potentially in violation of ethics statutes.\n\nThe report, accompanied by a tranche of internal White House emails, outlines a plan spearheaded by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to export technology for approximately 40 nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia. The scheme, previously known through reporting by the Wall Street Journal and others, is now provided with more context and insight into the behind-the-scenes maneuvering to push the proposal forward.\n\nThe initiative was part of a broader Middle East economic development plan that Flynn began developing before President Trump's inauguration, while he was serving as an adviser to Trump's campaign and transition team. During this time, Flynn was also working as an adviser for a private company called IP3 International, a firm run by retired US military generals with a clear financial interest in exporting US nuclear energy technology to Saudi Arabia.\n\nOnce Trump was inaugurated, Flynn, along with longtime Trump associate Thomas Barrack, worked with other senior officials in the new Trump administration to make the plan a reality. On January 27, 2017, just seven days after the inauguration, several of the retired generals from IP3 visited the White House to discuss the nuclear plan for Saudi Arabia with Derek Harvey, a senior staffer on Trump's National Security Council at the time.\n\nAccording to the House report, immediately after the meeting, Harvey directed the NSC staff to add information about IP3's \"plan for 40 nuclear power plants\" to the briefing package for President Trump's call with Saudi Arabia's King Salman.\n\nAs of now, it appears the proposal is still under consideration, but there is no indication one way or the other that the president will agree to it. At a minimum, the White House is still in discussions to sell nuclear equipment to Saudi Arabia despite fierce Democratic opposition.\n\nThe proposed nuclear deal, on the surface, seems beneficial: an American business stands to make significant profits\u2014possibly billions of dollars\u2014by selling nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, while Riyadh would gain a new energy source to power its economy. However, the problem lies in the potential illegality of the scheme.\n\nFor the US to sell nuclear technology to a foreign country, it must sign what's known as a \"123 agreement.\" This agreement, based on Section 123 of the 1954 US Atomic Energy Act, establishes the criteria for the US to sell nuclear materials to other countries. If a country wants to buy nuclear equipment from the US\u2014for example, a nuclear reactor\u2014it must meet nine conditions, including a guarantee that it will not use the technology to make nuclear weapons. Congress does not have to approve the sale.\n\nHowever, according to the Democrats' report, Harvey, the senior National Security Council staffer (who is also a close Flynn ally), ignored these requirements and insisted that the decision to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia had already been made. If true, this means Harvey attempted to make the deal happen without arranging for Saudi Arabia to sign the 123 agreement, which could potentially allow Riyadh to pursue a nuclear weapon with US-sold equipment in the future.\n\nFurthermore, there is the issue of Michael Flynn's personal involvement in the deal. Flynn, who previously consulted for IP3, may have skirted ethics rules, according to \"whistleblowers\" who spoke with House Democrats. White House ethics officials reportedly brought these concerns to light.\n\nAccording to the report, one senior political official felt Harvey's proposal was \"not a business plan,\" but rather \"a scheme for these generals to make some money.\" This official then added, \"Okay, you know we can not do this.\"\n\nClearly, their warnings were ignored\u2014which may be why the whistleblowers spoke to congressional Democrats in the first place.\n\nThe main story here is Democrats stepping up their oversight of Trump's foreign policy. As I stated earlier, the broad outlines of this scheme have already been known for a while now, thanks to reporting from the Wall Street Journal and others.\n\nFlynn's history of pushing specific policies while being on the payroll of the primary beneficiaries of said policies is also well-documented. Barrack, the longtime Trump associate who worked with Flynn to make the Saudi nuclear deal happen, has been vocal about his support for Saudi Arabia.\n\nHowever, armed with insider information and internal documents from the whistleblowers, House Democrats were able to put together a report that fills in many of the gaps and sheds new light on how this Saudi nuclear deal went from being an idea cooked up by Flynn and a few retired generals to a serious policy being pursued at the highest levels of the White House.\n\nThis is exactly what Democrats promised to do when they took the House last November. Democratic Congress members and staffers told me they would oversee every aspect of Trump's foreign policy, from his use of the military to his foreign connections.\n\nIf the report didn't come out, it's entirely possible that the White House would have an easier time signing the nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia. That outcome is now in doubt, and any effort to make an agreement will likely be met with stiff resistance from Democrats in Congress.\n\nThat means Trump's ability to conduct global affairs as he wishes is now curtailed. Tuesday's report is at least a warning shot\u2014but it could be a sign of bigger things to come.",
    " Title: Florida Halts Publication of Real-Time Coronavirus Death Data Compiled by Medical Examiners\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has raised concerns among transparency advocates, Florida health officials have ceased publishing real-time coronavirus death data reported by medical examiners. The decision comes after the data showed a higher number of fatalities than the official state total, as reported by The Tampa Bay Times.\n\nThe last nine days have seen the absence of lists compiled by the state Medical Examiners Commission. The halt in updates followed The Tampa Bay Times' report that the medical examiners' death count was approximately 10% higher than the number reported by the Florida Department of Health.\n\nDr. Stephen Nelson, who heads the commission, told the outlet that the change in policy was enacted after state health officials intervened. Nelson stated that the officials plan to redact causes of deaths and descriptions of cases from the data, rendering the lists \"meaningless.\"\n\n\"This is no different than any other public record we deal with,\" Nelson added. \"It's paid for by taxpayer dollars, and the taxpayers have a right to know.\"\n\nThe lists have been made public since medical examiners began compiling them in 1992. Paul Petrino, who runs the Palm Beach County medical examiner's office, told The Times that county lawyers instructed him to stop releasing the numbers last week.\n\n\"I was actually taken aback when they called us,\" Petrino said, adding that the data was important to make public so that individuals have accurate information about the health crisis. \"I'd hate to see anything hinder that.\"\n\nThe health department told The Times that it \"participated in conference calls\" with law enforcement officials to express \"privacy concerns for the individuals that passed away related to COVID-19.\"\n\nThe request came after the health department last month tried to convince the Miami-Dade County medical examiner's office to block access to death records, according to The Miami Herald. The county released the data, anyway.\n\nThe health department also refused to release information about infections in nursing homes until news outlets sued for the information.\n\n\"It's just shocking to me the level of interference,\" Barbara Petersen of the First Amendment Foundation told The Times.\n\nA spokesperson for the health department in Hillsborough County argued that the discrepancies in the state's numbers could be due to a lag in reporting. Florida also excludes travelers and seasonal residents who died in the state, even though medical examiners do include them.\n\nThe efforts to keep public health information under wraps come as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, moved to reopen parts of the state's economy after he delayed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the outbreak. DeSantis on Wednesday announced the plan to reopen, as the state saw its largest spike in coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began.\n\nFlorida's Democratic congressional delegation wrote a letter to DeSantis last week, questioning the \"inconsistencies between COVID-19 death tracking methods used by the Florida Department of Health and county medical examiners.\" They called for a \"detailed explanation of the public health justification\" for excluding nonresidents from the state's death count.",
    " Title: The Evolution of \"Me Too\" and the Current Controversy Surrounding Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to its origins eight decades ago, the phrase \"Me Too\" has taken on a new meaning in today's society. Originally coined to describe a wave of Republican politicians aligning with the policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the term now stands as a symbol of a movement that aims to address sexual assault and harassment.\n\nThe movement, which has toppled television personalities, movie moguls, and politicians, has set its sights on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The allegations against Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford have sparked a heated debate, with some questioning the veracity of her claims and others insisting that the allegations must be believed.\n\nFord's story, which conflicts with that of the man she names as an eyewitness and the notes taken by her therapist, lacks specific details such as the approximate date and precise location of the alleged assault. Her history of supporting left-wing causes has led some to question her motives.\n\nThe call for belief, however, is strong. Senator Mazie Hirono declared, \"Women like Dr. Ford, who bravely come forward, need to be heard, but they need to be believed.\" Hillary Clinton echoed this sentiment, stating, \"You have the right to be believed.\"\n\nThe movement's fervor has not only affected those accused of misconduct but also those perceived as insufficiently supportive of the movement. Last week, The Tonight Show disinvited comedian Norm Macdonald from its studios, despite no accusations of misbehavior involving women. Macdonald's comments expressing support for the slowing of the #MeToo movement sparked backlash, validating his opinion while simultaneously contradicting it.\n\nSimilarly, editor Ian Buruma published an essay by Jian Ghomeshi, an Iranian-Canadian talk show host accused of sexual assault, in the New York Review of Books. Buruma's decision to publish the essay led to his resignation after university presses threatened a boycott.\n\nThe reluctance to come forward with allegations of sexual harassment and assault is understandable, given the often he said-she said nature of such claims. This warrants tolerance for the alleged victims, not the stripping of the accused of their rights. Due process, the presumption of innocence, and the right to confront one's accuser are principles that appear to be at odds with the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe movement, which has been credited with reorienting the behavior of powerful men, has entered a stage reminiscent of the Reign of Terror. As the movement continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether it can correct the harm it was intended to address without also infringing on fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and due process.",
    " Title: Global Powers Condemn Trump's Auto Tariff Investigation, Fear Trade Disruption\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked global concern, the Trump administration announced on Thursday its decision to launch an investigation into the potential imposition of tariffs on automotive imports, citing national security grounds. The move is seen as a negotiating tactic in the stalled talks with Canada and Mexico over the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nThe United States is the largest importer of passenger vehicles and light trucks, with Mexico being the top exporter, followed by Japan, Canada, Germany, and South Korea, according to the Department of Commerce. Japan, which accounts for about 40 percent of U.S. vehicle imports, has expressed its concern over the potential trade measures.\n\nJapan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, Hiroshige Seko, stated that such a measure would be \"an extremely far-reaching trade sanction that would put the global market into turmoil.\" Germany's association of industry groups also voiced their opposition, describing auto tariffs as a \"provocation\" and \"another nasty blow to our economic relations\" with the United States. The European Union executive also stated that the move would be against the rules of global trade.\n\nIn Beijing, Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng expressed similar concerns, stating that abusing national security provisions would \"undermine the multilateral trade system and disrupt the order of international trade.\" China, a relatively minor player in the U.S. auto import market, has expressed its intention to closely monitor the progress of the U.S. investigation and to defend its legitimate rights and interests.\n\nJapanese and European automakers have not issued individual comments, but some have referred to Global Automakers, an industry group of international automakers. The group's Chief Executive, John Bozzella, stated that the move would merely hurt American consumers, as it would lead to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America.\n\nLast week, Japan went to the World Trade Organization to warn of possible retaliation for tariffs on steel and aluminum, which Trump imposed in March. Japan is the only major U.S. ally that was not granted a temporary exemption from the tariffs. Japan estimates these tariffs will cost it about 50 billion yen (approximately $450 million) a year.\n\nChina, while a relatively minor player in the U.S. auto import market, is eager to expand its car industry abroad. In auto parts exports to the U.S., China was ranked second last year. A person familiar with the discussions has suggested that the president has proposed new tariffs of 20 to 25 percent on automobile imports.\n\nCritics fear that other countries may retaliate with trade sanctions of their own and question the effectiveness of the move given the lengthy review required and the legal challenges ahead.",
    " Title: Senate Rules Committee's Statement on Press Access Sparks Controversy Among Capitol Hill Journalists\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Senate Rules Committee has sparked controversy among Capitol Hill journalists after issuing a statement on Tuesday, stating that there have been no changes to the existing rules governing press coverage on the Senate side of the Capitol complex. The statement followed a brief outcry from television reporters who were informed that they could no longer conduct on-camera interviews with lawmakers without permission from the Senate Rules Committee.\n\nThe committee's statement, however, did acknowledge that they have been working with press galleries to \"ensure compliance with existing rules\" to maintain a \"safe environment\" for everyone. This \"safety\" justification has been a topic of discussion among Capitol Hill journalists, as the number of reporters on the Hill has reportedly doubled under the Trump administration.\n\nVeteran reporters have estimated that there are about double the number of reporters on the Hill on average legislative days compared to previous administrations. The Senate subway cars, where reporters huddle upon arrival from the Russell, Hart, and Dirksen office buildings, serve as a crowded platform. As key senators emerge from the cars, they are met with 20 or 30 microphones jammed into their faces.\n\nThe moving press horde ascends a flight of stairs and proceeds another 50 feet or so until the senators can escape into the members-only elevator. Once the senators reach the second floor, where the Senate chamber is, they will meet the same scene from reporters stationed there, before escaping into the chamber or a private room.\n\nSenators, who tend to be very old, are often surrounded by reporters due to their influential positions. For instance, Sen. Orrin Hatch, who is 83, is often surrounded by 3 to 4 million reporters since he runs the committee with health care and tax reform jurisdiction. The concern is that someone could trip, fall into Hatch, and potentially cause harm.\n\nThe increased number of reporters on the Hill is due to the significant amount of news that is being generated from the Hill. The government is currently unified under one party for the first time in several Congresses, and it is working to achieve long-standing ideological goals. The head of the unified government is President Donald Trump, who is known for his unconventional style and questionable grasp of facts.\n\nThe FBI and two select congressional committees are also conducting investigations into Russian interference in the election. The increased number of reporters on the Hill is a direct response to the increased amount of news coming from the Hill.\n\nWhile the majority of these reporters are not asking questions that Republican lawmakers are thrilled to answer, they are posing questions that are relevant and important to the public. Questions such as, \"Sen. Bob Corker, what do you think of Trump's tweets this morning?\" or \"Sen. Jeff Flake, will you support a bill that ends the Medicaid expansion in your state?\" or \"Do you think that it was appropriate for the president to issue a veiled threat to the FBI director and then fire him?\"\n\nIf senators are truly concerned about the size of reporter mobs and their safety, they could be more forthcoming with information about their policies, perhaps through regular press conferences. This would reduce the need for reporters to be creative in their methods of obtaining information.\n\nUntil that day comes, let's be careful not to trip Sen.

    " Title: Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal Urges GOP to \"Stop Being the Stupid Party\" in Call for Change\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a keynote address at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting on Thursday, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal called on the Republican Party to \"stop being the stupid party.\" The GOP, according to Jindal, does not need to change its values but may need to change \"just about everything else we are doing.\"\n\nJindal, who is often mentioned as a potential 2016 presidential contender, emphasized the need for the GOP to shift its focus from Capitol Hill number crunching to \"the place where conservatism thrives -- in the real world beyond the Washington Beltway.\"\n\nThe call for change comes as Republican leaders have promised to release a report in March, titled the \"Growth and Opportunity Project,\" outlining recommendations on party rules and messaging designed to appeal to a rapidly changing American electorate. The report aims to address the GOP's struggles in reaching out to minority and women voters, who largely supported President Barack Obama in the November election.\n\nRepublican strategist Sally Bradshaw, who is part of a team appointed by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus to craft the report, stated, \"I think you're going to see a very renewed, aggressive effort by this party to put on a different face.\" Bradshaw added, \"We are going to go into areas that we do not go into and see folks that we do not see.\"\n\nThe 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, faced criticism for his stance on immigration and women's issues, which were seen as alienating to Hispanic voters and women, respectively. Romney's support for a border fence and \"self-deportation\" of illegal immigrants, as well as down-ticket candidates' backing of new abortion laws and Todd Akin's controversial comments about \"legitimate rape,\" were among the factors that contributed to the GOP's losses.\n\nGOP strategist Ari Fleischer suggested that the party could learn from Democrats on messaging, stating, \"Republicans talk policy and Democrats talk people. Republicans can learn a little bit from Democrats on how to make those people connections with our policies.\"\n\nWhen asked about his own presidential aspirations for 2016, Jindal declined to comment, stating, \"Any Republican that's thinking about talking about running for president in 2016 needs to get his head examined. We've got a lot of work to do.\"\n\nJindal urged conservatives to focus on connecting with voters across the nation rather than fighting with Democrats on the size of government in Washington. He criticized the GOP's obsession with government bookkeeping, stating, \"We seem to have an obsession with government bookkeeping. This is a rigged game, and it is the wrong game for us to play.\"\n\nThe call for change comes as the House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday to permit the government to borrow enough money to avoid a first-time default for at least four months. The bill was passed on a bipartisan basis, with majority Republicans backing away from their previous demand that any increase in the government's borrowing cap be paired with an equivalent level of spending cuts.\n\nJindal's blunt remarks follow criticism from another high-profile Republican, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who publicly blasted GOP leadership on Capitol Hill over their response to Superstorm Sandy relief efforts. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested that House Republicans could use hearings to expose waste and promote better ideas.",
    " Title: U.S. Supreme Court Overturns Alabama Redistricting Plan, Deems District Court Ruling on Redistricting as Legally Erroneous\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 5-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned a district court ruling that upheld Alabama's redistricting plan, which was accused of overloading some districts with black Democratic voters. The high court found the lower court's ruling to be legally erroneous.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer, who delivered the opinion, was joined by the court's other liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, as well as the swing vote, Justice Anthony Kennedy. The court's conservatives, including Chief Justice John Roberts, Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas, dissented. Thomas wrote a separate dissent.\n\nAs reported by NPR's Nina Totenberg last November, the high court was asked to decide whether a 2010 state legislative redistricting in Alabama overloaded some districts with black Democrats on the basis of race or party.\n\nIn 2000, Democrats controlled the state Legislature and the redistricting process. They used their power to create districts with black majorities under the Voting Rights Act, while at the same time putting enough reliably Democratic black voters into majority white districts so that white Democratic candidates could build black-white coalitions and have a chance of winning. By 2010, Republicans controlled the Legislature, and they set about consolidating the black vote into existing majority-black districts. Under the plan, about one-sixth of all eligible black voters were moved from majority white state Senate districts to majority-black districts. The result was that in some of those districts, the black majority increased to over 70 percent. At the same time, the majority white districts got whiter, and more safely Republican.\n\nThe redistricting came after the 2010 census showed population shifts that made some existing districts way too big in population terms, and others too small. The Republicans tried to equalize the size of the districts. They also tried to maintain the same number of majority-black districts, contending that under the Voting Rights Act, a simple majority of black voters in those districts was not enough. Democrats disagree and contend that the GOP plan calls for unconstitutional racial quotas.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Justice Breyer said the lower court should have reviewed claims of racial gerrymandering on a district-by-district level, not just statewide. He also said the court did not apply the right test when it found that race was not the primary motivating factor.\n\nState officials say they had no choice but to concentrate black voters in some districts, making neighboring seats more white and apt to elect Republicans. The case is expected to be sent back to the lower court for further review.",
    " Title: GOP Divide Threatens Bipartisan Efforts on Comprehensive Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 election, there appears to be a shift in the Republican Party's stance on immigration, with a potential for a bipartisan deal. However, a significant hurdle looms: disagreement among Republicans on the approach to reform.\n\nSome Republicans advocate for piecemeal reform, focusing on popular issues while deferring contentious matters, such as a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, for later consideration. Others, in alignment with Democrats, argue that a comprehensive deal is necessary to address the issue effectively.\n\nThe rifts that existed prior to the election persist, providing little evidence, at this early stage, that a deal will materialize as promising as it seemed on November 7.\n\n\"Doing a comprehensive bill is a big mistake,\" said Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho). \"What you end up having is a bill that nobody likes. Everybody hates one piece of it. It's a way to actually avoid doing what we need to do to solve the immigration problem.\"\n\nRepublicans favoring a piece-by-piece approach argue that starting with politically palatable issues could generate bipartisan momentum for a broader overhaul. They also point to the frustration generated by large legislative efforts such as the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.\n\n\"There's going to be a natural desire to try to pair things up [on immigration],\" said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the incoming Senate minority whip. \"But at some point, the bill gets so big and cumbersome that I think by virtue of the size alone, that that makes it harder to pass.\"\n\nThe general outlines of a comprehensive package are clear. It would encompass provisions on border security and law enforcement, reforms to the legal immigration system, and a solution for the undocumented immigrants residing in the United States.\n\nHowever, it is the last point that Democrats fear would be neglected if Congress dismantles immigration reform. A pathway to citizenship is the one thing Democrats and immigration advocates will insist on, but it is certain to encounter the strongest GOP resistance.\n\n\"That is probably the part of immigration reform that needs the greatest reform,\" said Rep. Charles Gonzalez (D-Texas), the outgoing chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. \"That's why I've never really understood that people really believe that this piecemeal thing is going to get us anywhere.\"\n\n\"Why only half fix the problem?\" added California Rep. Xavier Becerra, the incoming House Democratic Caucus chairman. \"Let's go ahead and fix the whole thing. If you've got a machine that's not working well, you're not going to fix just half of it and have it still not work well, let's go ahead and fix it right.\"",
    " Title: \"Fiscal Slope: Turning the 'Cliff' into a 'Bunny Slope' for a Gradual Budget Adjustment\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding the so-called \"fiscal cliff,\" it is crucial to understand that the situation is not as dire as some may portray. Rather than a cliff, the fiscal challenges facing the U.S. economy can be more accurately described as a slope.\n\nWhile the potential tax increases and spending cuts, with the exception of the payroll tax increase and extended unemployment benefits, are not expected to take effect on Jan. 1, 2013, or Feb. 1, 2013, if a budget deal isn't reached by those dates, the \"dramatic impact\" on the economy of a failure to reach a deal is largely exaggerated.\n\nIf President Barack Obama and Capitol Hill lawmakers remain rational and dispassionate, they can mitigate the impact of the fiscal slope by turning it into a smaller or \"bunny slope,\" to borrow a skiing metaphor. Congressional leaders can lessen the impact of the budget deal by spreading the tax increases and spending cuts out over a longer period.\n\nTo achieve this, a four-part plan, or \"bunny slope,\" is proposed:\n\n1. Instead of letting all of the 2001-2003 Bush income tax cuts on families with income over $250,000 per year and individuals over $200,000 expire, have one-half the income tax cuts expire on Jan. 1, 2013, and the second half expire on Jan. 1, 2014.\n2. Elongate sequestration, the roughly $100 billion in automatic spending cuts - half from the Department of Defense, half from non-defense programs \u2013 to three years. In 2013, cut $20 billion from DOD and $20 billion from non-defense programs, and cut the same amount in 2014 and 2015.\n3. Increase the payroll tax that funds Social Security to its normal rate, 6.2 percent, from 4.2 percent, over two years: to 5.2 percent in 2013, and to 6.2 percent in 2014.\n4. Let business expense tax write-offs, and other business tax provisions, expire over two years: half in 2013, and half in 2014.\n\nThese tax and spending changes would cut the budget deficit by an equal amount - about $148 billion - in both 2013 and 2014, which would decrease the projected budget deficit to $980 billion in 2013, and $832 billion in 2014.\n\nFurther, assuming tax or spending policies remain the same after 2014, and the U.S. economy grows at a 3.0 percent rate, the budget deficit should decline to about $652 billion in 2015, $452 billion in 2016, and $230 billion in 2017.\n\nIn 2017, the $230 billion budget deficit will occur in a roughly $3.9 trillion U.S. budget \u2013 one in which the net interest payment on the national debt will be about $350 billion to $380 billion.\n\nIn other words, by deploying merely the \"bunny slope\" plan of gradual tax increases and spending cuts, the non-debt-service portion of the U.S. budget will be balanced by the end of 2017.\n\nTherefore, investors, and typical Americans, should not agonize over the current budget talks. The so-called fiscal cliff is really a fiscal slope, and the slope that exists can be converted into a bunny slope - further mitigating any GDP impact - so long as Obama and Congress remain rational and dispassionate. The two parties need to meet in a room and not return until a budget deal is reached. And when the budget deal is reached, the American people, and probably the late, great LBJ, as well, will be very proud.",
    " Title: Trump's Proposed Tariffs on Mexican Goods: Implications for U.S. Economy and Immigration Policy\n\nThe United States is considering a new tariff on Mexican goods, which would add to the existing tariffs imposed by President Trump on aluminum and steel imports, as well as Chinese imports. The potential 25% tariff could result in an additional $87 billion annually to the current $19 billion in Trump tariffs collected so far.\n\nIf implemented, Mexico is expected to retaliate with counter-tariffs, which could significantly impact sectors such as American agriculture. Just two weeks ago, tariffs on Mexican aluminum and steel were lifted, and in return, Mexico removed tariffs on American farm goods. This brief respite may prove short-lived, as farmers may once again need to explore new markets.\n\nThe question remains whether the potential benefits of this tariff outweigh the economic pain for American consumers. President Trump is employing tariffs as a means to pressure Mexico into strengthening border control measures. While the cost of the tariff would be borne by Americans, the Mexican economy could also experience a loss in sales to the United States.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that a significant portion of the immigrants attempting to cross the southern border are fleeing issues in Central America that are largely beyond the control of the Mexican government. Furthermore, while President Trump often refers to all immigrants as illegal, many are exercising a legal right to seek asylum.\n\nHistorically, past administrations have sought cooperation from Mexico on immigration matters without disrupting economic relations between the two countries. President Trump's decision to intertwine the two issues risks disrupting both economies, as the manufacturing sectors in Mexico and the United States are closely interconnected. According to Deutsche Bank, about two-thirds of trade between the countries is between factories owned by the same company.",
    " Title: Sen. Amy Klobuchar Withdraws from Vice Presidential Consideration, Advocates for a Woman of Color\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) announced on Thursday that she is withdrawing her name from consideration as Joe Biden's running mate. In a statement, Klobuchar expressed her belief that a woman of color should be chosen as the vice-presidential nominee.\n\nKlobuchar, who had been a strong contender for the position, had been a consistent performer in the Democratic primary debates and had garnered support from various demographics, particularly in the Midwest. However, her record as a prosecutor has been a point of contention among progressive activists, and her perceived lack of appeal among African-American voters has been a topic of discussion in political circles.\n\nThe decision by Klobuchar to step aside from the vice-presidential race comes at a time when the Democratic Party is grappling with the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement and the need for a more diverse ticket. Some political observers suggest that Klobuchar may have seen the writing on the wall, with graffiti from Black Lives Matter activists declaring \"Don't pick Amy Klobuchar\" in some cities.\n\nIf a Biden administration comes to pass, it is possible that Klobuchar could be offered a prestigious cabinet post or other high-level position. In the event of a Biden victory, Klobuchar would have played a significant role in the primary and in the running-mate selection process, putting her personal ambitions aside to support the party's nominee.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the November election, Klobuchar's decision to withdraw from the vice-presidential race will likely be seen as a strategic move that positions her for future opportunities within the Democratic Party.",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Disapproval of President Trump's Job Performance at 60%, Highest in Washington Post-ABC News Polling\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by The Washington Post and ABC News has shown that 60% of Americans disapprove of President Donald Trump's job performance, marking a new high in polling conducted by the outlet. The poll, released on Friday, was conducted just days after special counsel Robert Mueller delivered a series of blows to the Trump administration in federal court.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted last week, found that only 36% of Americans approve of Trump's job performance. In the previous Washington Post-ABC News poll, conducted in April, Trump's approval rating was 40% and his disapproval rating was 56%.\n\nThe poll also found that most Americans would oppose Trump granting a pardon to former associate Paul Manafort, with 66% of respondents saying they were against a pardon. Only 18% said they would support a pardon.\n\nTrump has recently focused negative attention on Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom Trump has blamed for Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. In an interview with Fox News' \"Fox & Friends,\" the president criticized Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe and for failing to seize control of the Justice Department. However, a majority of Americans side with Sessions, with 62% saying they are on his side. A slightly larger portion, 64%, said Trump should not fire Sessions.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller saw similar positive percentages, with 63% of those polled supporting Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and 29% saying they oppose it. Further, 53% of respondents said they think Trump tried to interfere in Mueller's investigation in a way that \"amounts to obstruction of justice,\" while 35% said he did not try to interfere.\n\nA similar portion of survey respondents, 61%, said they believe it would be a crime if Trump directed Michael Cohen to make hush-money payments to two women who say they had affairs with Trump during the 2016 election. Cohen pleaded guilty to making payments of that nature, violating campaign-finance laws at the \"direction of a candidate for federal office,\" meaning Trump.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the economy, Americans were more favorable in their evaluations of the president. Forty-five percent of those polled said they approve of Trump's handling of the economy, while 47% said they disapprove.\n\nThe poll, which included a sample of 1,003 adults, was conducted from Aug. 26 to Aug. 29 via landlines and cellphones. The poll's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3.5 percentage points.",
    " Title: Seven Potential Inflection Points That Could Tip the 2012 Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2012 presidential race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney remains a tight one, with the Supreme Court's health care ruling no longer a significant factor, the campaign has entered a phase of relative stability. In a series of national polls, the race is a close 3-percentage-point contest, with Obama slightly ahead of Romney.\n\nWith both candidates running cautious campaigns, the race is unlikely to be significantly altered by any one event. Steve Murphy, a Democratic strategist, notes, \"It didn't take long for the race to get locked in. There's no reason to think that it won't stay locked in.\"\n\nThe following are seven potential inflection points that could shift the narrative of the campaign:\n\n1. Debate Performances: The upcoming debates between Obama and Romney could significantly impact the race, as both candidates have the opportunity to present their visions for the future and address key policy issues.\n\n2. Unemployment Numbers: The state of the economy, particularly the unemployment rate, remains a significant concern for voters. Any significant changes in the unemployment rate could impact the race.\n\n3. Credit Downgrading: The ongoing European debt crisis could have implications for the U.S. economy and, consequently, the presidential race.\n\n4. Vice Presidential Candidates: The selection of vice presidential candidates could sway undecided voters and impact the race.\n\n5. Health Care Ruling Fallout: The Supreme Court's health care ruling has not significantly shifted the race, but its impact could continue to be felt as the candidates address the issue in the coming months.\n\n6. Foreign Policy Issues: The potential for Mideast or other foreign policy issues to flare up could impact voter perceptions of the candidates.\n\n7. Global Events: Global events, such as a true financial calamity in debt-dogged Europe, could also impact the race.\n\nRepublican strategist Curt Anderson notes, \"This race is going to be very close, and there's plenty of action left to come that can influence it.\" However, he adds, \"There is a lot more peril than upside in all these things for President Obama.\"\n\nAs the race enters its final stretch, these inflection points will be closely watched by both campaigns and political observers alike. The outcome of the election could hinge on one or more of these factors.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Contracts for First Time Since 2008 Recession, GDP Decreases 0.1% in Q4 2012\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has reported a slight contraction in the American economy in the fourth quarter of 2012, with a 0.1% decrease in real gross domestic product (GDP). This marks the first time the U.S. economy has shrunk since the end of the 2008 recession.\n\nThe real GDP, which measures the output of goods and services produced by labor and property in the United States, decreased at an annual rate of 0.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. In the third quarter, real GDP increased by 3.1%. The downturn in real GDP in the fourth quarter was primarily due to decreases in private inventory investment, federal government spending, exports, and state and local government spending, which were partly offset by increases in nonresidential fixed investment, a larger decrease in imports, and an acceleration in personal consumption expenditures (PCE).\n\nThe 22% decline in federal military spending was the main factor contributing to the economic contraction. Nonmilitary spending by the federal government increased by 6%, but this was not enough to offset the decline in military spending cuts. One possible reason for the sharp decline in defense spending is the looming threat of the budget sequester brought on by the 2011 Budget Control Act. The Department of Defense may have made up for the prospect of budget cuts in Q3 2012 before paring back in Q4.\n\nThe March budget sequester is still scheduled to take place, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the defense spending cuts will result in a 0.4% drop in GDP. Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle will have to agree on some sort of package to delay the cuts to avoid a potential recession.\n\nThe GDP report was not all bad, though. Personal consumption spending and investment were growing, increasing by 2.2% and 8.4%, respectively. The boost in personal spending was driven mostly by durable goods, which suggests that consumers are replacing worn-out items. However, the lack of consumer confidence could spell trouble as well.\n\nThe BEA emphasized that the fourth-quarter advance estimate released today is based on incomplete or subject-to-revision source data. The \"second\" estimate for the fourth quarter, based on more complete data, will be released on February 28, 2013.",
    " Title: Romney's Foreign Policy Strategy: A Balance of Tough Talk and Diplomacy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his speech at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) last week, Mitt Romney outlined his foreign policy vision, addressing key issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Iran's nuclear program, and the Middle East in general. The speech, however, revealed a candidate who has left himself a significant amount of flexibility in terms of specific policy actions.\n\nRomney emphasized his commitment to a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living peacefully alongside Israel, criticizing President Obama for failing to achieve this goal. He also touched upon the theme of American \"weakness\" during the Obama era and the abandonment of allies, a message that has political appeal.\n\nHowever, the specifics of what Romney would do, particularly on issues like Iran's nuclear program and dealing with difficult allies like Pakistan or Egypt, seem to align closely with Obama's approach in some instances. The speech appeared to gloss over positions Romney took more than a year ago, such as his opposition to expanding the intervention in Libya and his skepticism about a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nRomney's foreign policy team, which has seen a shift in composition over the past few months, is reportedly still grappling with these issues. The candidate himself has not been deeply engaged in foreign policy matters during the campaign, particularly compared to his enthusiasm for economic issues.\n\nThe team, overseen by Kerry Healey, includes figures like Richard S. Williamson, Mitchell B. Reiss, and Jim Talent. Notable absentees include some well-known figures from the Republican foreign policy circles, such as John R. Bolton and Henry A. Kissinger.\n\nThe speech and Romney's foreign policy strategy, according to his advisers, reflect a candidate who resonates best with the concepts of \"projecting strength\" and \"restoring global economic growth.\" However, the candidate's foreign policy positions seem to be a blend of different viewpoints within his own campaign, leading to some inconsistencies and confusion.\n\nFor instance, Romney's stance on Syria has been unclear, with advisers stating that he favors arming the Syrian rebels, but then correcting that he prefers Arab neighbors to arm them. Similarly, his position on Iran's nuclear capabilities has been inconsistent, with him initially stating he would prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear \"capability,\" but later seeming to agree with Obama that he would prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon.\n\nIn the VMI speech, Romney returned to his promise to \"prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability,\" but focused primarily on new sanctions on Iran, a move that comes after Obama has imposed what experts agree are the most severe sanctions in history, combined with cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear infrastructure.\n\nOverall, Romney's foreign policy strategy appears to be a balance of tough talk and diplomacy, with a focus on restoring American strength and global economic growth. However, the specifics of his policy actions remain somewhat unclear, and the candidate's foreign policy team is still in the process of defining his positions on various issues.",
    " Title: Market Analysts Offer Cautious Outlook as U.S. Economy Gradually Reopens\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the U.S. economy begins to reopen, the stock market has shown signs of recovery, with stocks rising in volatile trading on Wednesday. However, the market's trajectory remains uncertain, as bank stocks climbed, but tech-focused \"stay-at-home\" plays fell.\n\nDavid Lebovitz, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, expressed caution due to uncertainties surrounding the reopening process. He stated, \"We have been surprised by the speed and the magnitude at which things have moved, but when you think about building a diversified portfolio, you have the 10-year Treasury yield at 70 basis points. Equities look attractive even if they're trading at north of 20 times. So, we have been encouraging folks to stay long equities despite some of the risks that exist.\"\n\nLebovitz's caution stems from the unknowns about reopening the economy, particularly the capacity requirements for businesses to operate profitably. He pointed out that for many businesses, especially service-oriented ones, reaching the break-even point might require 75% capacity, which could be challenging to achieve given the current circumstances.\n\nMike Mayo, managing director and head of U.S. large-cap bank research at Wells Fargo Securities, suggested that the Federal Reserve should let its policies from the previous recession work. He argued, \"We've run over 200 earnings models. We've run different scenarios: a V recovery, a U recovery, an L recovery, and it's pretty tough, we think, for the government to conclude that large banks, well-capitalized banks, well-capitalized banks that earned their dividend twice over in the first quarter, in a quarter when they built reserves, we find it very tough for the Fed to conclude that banks should cut the dividends now.\"\n\nJason Furman, economic policy professor at Harvard University and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, warned investors against getting too eager too soon. He predicted a two-phase recovery, with a rapid partial bounce-back followed by a long and painful slog. Furman noted that the initial growth, observed from April 15 to May 15, is the low-hanging fruit of growth, but a significant number of people and businesses may not return to their pre-pandemic state.\n\nIn conclusion, while the U.S. economy is gradually reopening, market analysts and economists remain divided on the timeline for recovery. They urge caution and emphasize the importance of quality assets in building portfolios during this uncertain juncture. The Fed's role in supporting the recovery, particularly in relation to bank dividends, is also a topic of debate among experts.",

According to the filings, these documents reveal about $1 billion in wire transfers between and among the defendants and their shell companies during the same timeframe that Purdue Pharma was allegedly draining its opioid-related proceeds.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, in a statement released on Friday, stated, \"The Sacklers continue to lowball victims and skirt a responsible settlement. We refuse to allow the family to misuse the courts in an effort to shield their financial misconduct.\"\n\nThe Attorney General's office is investigating whether these transactions were a deliberate attempt by the Sackler family, who own Purdue Pharma, to conceal assets from litigants.\n\nPurdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin, is facing thousands of lawsuits linked to the opioid crisis that has claimed tens of thousands of lives in the U.S. The company earlier this week announced a tentative settlement of $3 billion, with payments to be made from the sale of Mundipharma, a sister company also owned by the Sacklers.\n\nHowever, the proposed settlement, which could see Purdue pay up to $12 billion and the Sackler family relinquish control of the company, has been met with criticism. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, in a statement, called it a \"slap in the face\" that allows the Sackler family to \"walk away billionaires and admit no wrongdoing.\"\n\nIn response to the allegations, a spokesperson for Mortimer D.A. Sackler, formerly a Purdue board member, said in a statement to The New York Times, \"This is a cynical attempt by a hostile A.G.'s office to generate defamatory headlines to try to torpedo a mutually beneficial settlement that is supported by so many other states and would result in billions of dollars going to communities and individuals across the country that need help.\"\n\nThe New York Attorney General's office is continuing its investigation into the matter.",
    " Title: Obama's \"Private Sector is Doing Fine\" Comment Sparks Bipartisan Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Obama found himself at the receiving end of bipartisan criticism following an off-hand comment he made during a White House news conference on Friday. The comment, which suggested that the private sector was thriving, sparked a flurry of attacks from Republicans who accused the President of downplaying the economic struggles faced by the American people.\n\nDuring the news conference, Obama stated, \"As I've said, we created 4.3 million jobs over the last two years, 27 months, over 800,000 just this year alone. The private sector is doing fine.\" This statement, however, was met with immediate backlash, with many interpreting it as a dismissal of the economic struggles faced by the average American.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner was one of the first to respond, stating, \"Mr. President, I used to run a small business. And, Mr. President, take it from me, the private sector is not doing well.\" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor also weighed in, saying, \"As the speaker said, we just listened to the president say the private sector is doing fine. I would say Mr. President, are you kidding? Did you see the jobs numbers last week? The private sector is not doing fine.\"\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, also joined in the criticism, stating, \"He said the private sector is doing fine. Is he really that out of touch?\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also took to emailing journalists with the subject line \"The private sector is doing fine?\"\n\nTwitter was alive with Republicans jumping on the bandwagon, with the #doingfine hashtag trending. The comment was reminiscent of the criticism leveled at then-Senator John McCain in 2008 when he stated, \"The fundamentals of our economy are strong\" during the height of the Great Recession.\n\nJohn Dickerson, who writes for Slate and does political analysis for CBS News, made a relevant point in a tweet that seemed to suggest that Obama has some high-profile company when it comes to inducing winces in supporters and feeding frenzies among opponents. Dickerson tweeted, \" 'private sector is doing fine' = 'not concerned about the very poor.' Discuss.\"\n\nIn an attempt to unring the bell he struck earlier with his remark about the private sector being \"fine,\" Obama took the opportunity of a photo op with Philippine President Benigno Aquino to tell journalists that he is not unmoored from reality and indeed understands that the economy as a whole is not \"fine.\" The President's full response to a reporter's question can be found in the article's conclusion.",
    " Title: Republican Party Faces Internal Strife as Trump and Cruz Lead the Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party is grappling with deep-seated divisions following the ongoing presidential nomination race, with some party members expressing concern about the party's future direction. In a recent statement, former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie, also known as Mr. Buchanan, expressed his apprehension about the party's potential shift towards protectionism, nationalism, and a more insular focus on border security.\n\nThese tensions within the Republican ranks have been brewing since the end of the George W. Bush administration, initially sparked by policy disagreements and later exacerbated by the party's response to the country's evolving demography. While some party leaders, such as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, argue that the Republican Party must appeal to Hispanics and young people to survive, many voters view such appeals as a concession to the political establishment.\n\nInstead, these voters crave an uncompromising brand of conservatism that confronts rather than accommodates the political establishment, a sentiment that has been reinforced by conservative talk radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh and commentators like Ann Coulter, whose influential commentary shapes the party's agenda.\n\nLaura Ingraham, a talk-show host who played a significant role in the primary election defeat of Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader, in 2014, echoed this sentiment. \"All the things the voters want have been shoved off to the sidelines by Republican leaders,\" Ingraham said. \"And the voters finally have a couple of people here who are saying this table has to be turned over.\"\n\nRegardless of the eventual nominee, the rifts within the party promise to be challenging to mend. If an establishment candidate secures the nomination, the highly engaged supporters of Trump and Cruz may rebel, with about two-thirds of Trump supporters indicating they would vote for him as a third-party candidate, according to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll last month. This scenario could potentially aid the Democratic nominee.\n\nIf Ted Cruz is nominated, he will need to win over party leaders without alienating his anti-establishment supporters. A Fox News poll released on Friday revealed that 66 percent of Cruz supporters in Iowa felt \"betrayed\" by politicians within their party.\n\nIn the event that party leaders support Donald Trump, they would find themselves campaigning in parallel universes, backing a candidate who has advocated for mass deportation of illegal immigrants and a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, while simultaneously attempting to broaden their predominantly white male base. The party's internal discord underscores the significant challenges the Republican Party faces as it navigates the 2016 presidential election.",
    " Title: Clinton Email Scandal: A Closer Look at the Alleged Mishandling of Classified Information\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as U.S. Secretary of State continues to unfold, the controversy surrounding the matter has intensified. While Clinton has attempted to downplay the issue, the revelation of deleted emails and the handling of classified information has raised questions about her handling of sensitive government information.\n\nClinton has admitted to deleting approximately 30,000 emails from her time in office, claiming they were personal in nature. However, federal law defines emails used during the course of one's work for the federal government as the property of the federal government. By deleting these emails, Clinton may have potentially violated federal law.\n\nFurthermore, the 55,000 emails Clinton surrendered to the federal government were printed and not in their original digital format. This means that the metadata, which accompanies all digital emails and is crucial for tracing their origin and movement, was lost.\n\nClinton's decision to use a private email server for both personal and governmental emails has also come under scrutiny. Initially, Clinton stated that she believed using a single device for both types of emails would simplify her communications. However, it was later revealed that she carried four such devices.\n\nThe scandal took a more serious turn when it was discovered that Clinton's lawyers had the server that carried and stored the emails professionally wiped clean after she deleted the 30,000 emails and printed the 55,000 she surrendered to the feds.\n\nClinton has maintained that she did not send or receive any classified material on her email. However, an investigation by the State Department's and intelligence community's inspectors general found four classified emails among a random sample of 40. One of these emails was found to be top secret, containing satellite imagery of a foreign country and intercepts of communications among foreign agents.\n\nWhen confronted with these facts, Clinton changed her explanation, stating that she never sent or received any email marked classified. However, emails are not marked \"classified,\" but rather \"top secret,\" \"secret,\" or \"confidential.\"\n\nLast weekend, the State Department located 305 of Clinton's undeleted emails that likely fall into the top secret, secret, or classified categories. The potential consequences of Clinton's actions, if indicted for failure to secure classified information, remain to be seen.\n\nThe question of what should be the consequence of Clinton's behavior with the nation's most sensitive secrets is a matter of ongoing debate. If Clinton is indicted, she may argue that if an email was not marked with one of the above classifications, she did not know it was top secret. However, the nature of the information contained in the emails, such as satellite photos of foreign countries and intercepts of foreign agents, would likely be considered top secret.\n\nThe investigation into Clinton's email use is ongoing, and the outcome remains uncertain. However, the potential consequences of her actions, if found to have mishandled classified information, could have significant implications for her political future.",
    " Title: U.S. Citizens Slaughtered in Mexico, International Issue Arises as Cartel Violence Escalates\n\nArticle:\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) - In a tragic turn of events, at least three women and six children, all apparently U.S. citizens, were killed by drug cartel gunmen in northern Mexico, officials confirmed Tuesday. Six children were found alive, one child had a bullet wound, and one child is still missing.\n\nThe incident occurred in a rural, mountainous area on the Sonora-Chihuahua border. Mexican Security Secretary Alfonso Durazo suggested that the group's large SUVs may have been mistaken for rival gangs. At least five children have been taken to Phoenix, Arizona for treatment.\n\nThe slaughter of U.S. citizens on Mexican soil has sparked an international issue, with U.S. President Donald Trump tweeting, \"This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth.\"\n\nMexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, however, rejected this approach, stating at a Tuesday news conference, \"The worst thing you can have is war.\" L\u00f3pez Obrador said, \"We declared war, and it did not work. That is not an option.\"\n\nThis incident marks the second failure in recent weeks for L\u00f3pez Obrador's \"hugs not bullets\" anti-crime strategy. Two weeks ago, Mexican troops had to release a drug lord after his supporters mounted armed attacks in Culiacan, Sinaloa.\n\nPresident Trump's tweet read, \"The United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively. The great new President of Mexico has made this a big issue, but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!\"\n\nThe victims lived in the hamlet of La Mora in Sonora state, a decades-old settlement founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. La Mora is about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Douglas, Arizona. Many of the church's members were born in Mexico and thus have dual citizenship.\n\nA relative, who wished to remain anonymous due to fear of reprisals, stated that the burned-out, bullet-ridden SUV containing the remains of his nephew's wife and her four children - twin 6-month-old babies and two other children aged 8 and 10 - were found.\n\n\"The mafia vehicles got her and four of her kids, and then set their vehicle on fire, burnt them to a crisp,\" said the relative.\n\nTwo women and two other children were later found dead.\n\nDurazo stated that police, soldiers, and the National Guard were searching the area for the missing child. The relative speculated that it was a case of mistaken identity, as the cartel gunmen may have opened fire on the vehicle because it was an SUV.\n\nDurazo also noted that the Sinaloa cartel has a significant presence in the Sonora region, but a rival cartel is attempting to invade the territory from the Chihuahua side.\n\nAnother relative, Julian LeBaron, stated on his Facebook page that one of the dead women was Rhonita Maria LeBaron. Jhon LeBaron, another relative, posted on his Facebook page that his aunt and another woman were dead, and six of his aunt's children had been left abandoned but alive on a roadside.\n\nIt would not be the first time that members of the break-away church had been attacked in northern Mexico, where their forebears settled - often in Chihuahua state - decades ago. In 2009, Benjamin LeBaron, an anti-crime activist who was related to those killed in Monday's attack, was murdered in neighboring Chihuahua state.",
    " Title: Bipartisan U.S. Senators Introduce Tougher Sanctions on Russia, Combat Cyber Crime\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators from both the Republican and Democratic parties introduced legislation on Thursday aimed at imposing stricter sanctions on Russia and combating cybercrime. The bill, if passed, would be the latest response by lawmakers to punish Moscow for its interference in U.S. elections and activities in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nThe proposed legislation includes restrictions on new Russian sovereign debt transactions, energy and oil projects, and Russian uranium imports. It also imposes new sanctions on Russian political figures and oligarchs. The bill also expresses strong support for NATO and requires a two-thirds Senate vote in favor of any attempt to leave the alliance.\n\nRussian markets reacted swiftly to the measure, with the rouble slumping towards two-week lows. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the measure's lead sponsors, stated, \"The current sanctions regime has failed to deter Russia from meddling in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.\"\n\nCongress passed a Russia sanctions bill last summer, but some lawmakers expressed dissatisfaction with what they perceived as President Donald Trump's reluctance to implement it. Trump eventually signed the bill after it passed with overwhelming majorities.\n\nSeveral provisions of the measure introduced on Thursday aim to strengthen the previous law. Democratic Senator Bob Menendez stated that the administration had not fully complied with those sanctions. \"This bill is the next step in tightening the screws on the Kremlin and will bring to bear the full condemnation of the United States Congress so that Putin finally understands that the U.S. will not tolerate his behavior any longer,\" Menendez said.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats united last month in repudiating Trump's failure to publicly condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin for interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections. However, Congress failed to pass any legislation before lawmakers went on their weeks-long summer recess.\n\nThe bill would need to pass both the Senate and House of Representatives and be signed by Trump to become law. Aides to the Senate's Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, referred questions about the bill to the Senate Banking Committee. A committee spokeswoman had no details on what measures the panel might consider. McConnell stated last month that Senate committees should hold hearings on legislation to stop Russia from future election meddling. Both the Banking and Foreign Relations Committees have since scheduled hearings relating to Russia.",
    " Title: Russia's Constitutional Referendum: Putin Secures Future as President Until 2036\n\nArticle:\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to have secured his political future with a majority of votes in favor of a controversial national referendum that could see him remain in power until 2036. With 78 percent of votes counted, the referendum, which proposed more than 200 constitutional amendments, has shown strong support for the resetting of presidential term limits, allowing Putin to run for two more six-year terms in 2024 and 2030 if he chooses.\n\nOfficial results, after 98 percent of ballots had been counted, showed that the former KGB officer, who has ruled Russia for more than two decades as president or prime minister, had easily won the right to run for two more terms. The Central Election Commission reported that 78 percent of votes counted across the world's largest country had supported changing the constitution, with just over 21 percent voting against.\n\nThe Russian leader, who has been president for 20 years, made the case for constitutional revisions, invoking patriotism and making a vague promise of securing Russia's future. The Kremlin had been keen to downplay the resetting of Putin's length of office, and more than 200 other issues were put to the public in the polls. However, these issues amounted to little more than fine print on the ballot papers.\n\nThe vote was irregular for a Russian election, beginning with online voting and a nearly week-long opportunity for citizens to stop by polling stations amid the coronavirus pandemic. The most novel aspect of Wednesday's election was that early results were announced by the Central Election Commission well before polls had closed in many parts of the country.\n\nThe result does not set Putin's future in stone. It does pave the way for him to possibly hold on to power until 2036, giving him the opportunity to be Russia's longest-serving ruler since Peter the Great. However, he will have to run two more presidential campaigns, and if he chooses to do so, the question then will be how many people turn out to vote.",
    " Title: Florida High School Shooter's Alarming Behavior and Warnings Ignored Before Deadly Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed and more than a dozen others were wounded, authorities, neighbors, and classmates have recounted a series of alarming behaviors exhibited by the shooter, Nikolas Cruz.\n\nAccording to a complaint affidavit released on Thursday, Cruz admitted to being the gunman who entered the campus armed with an AR-15-style rifle and shot students he encountered in the hallways and on the school grounds. The 19-year-old former student, who had been expelled from the school, also may have stalked one of the girls he killed, a senior law-enforcement official said.\n\nNeighbors called the police, classmates said he was obsessed with guns, and campus security considered him troubled. \"Something was off with him,\" said Brody Speno, 19, who went to elementary and middle school with Cruz.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Cruz took an Uber car to his former high school just before classes were dismissed, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. He entered a school building with a legally purchased Smith & Wesson M & P 15 in a soft black bag. He readied his rifle and opened fire into five classrooms, the sheriff said.\n\nAuthorities can't arrest everyone they believe is dangerous, but \"we can and we must do better,\" said Attorney General Jeff Sessions, speaking to a sheriffs association in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced plans to redouble efforts to try to stop school violence, focusing more on mental health.\n\nCruz made his first appearance in court Thursday afternoon for a bond hearing, shuffling in shackles and wearing an orange outfit. He looked subdued and spoke only briefly, answering \"Yes, ma'am\" when asked to confirm his identity. Judge Kim Mollica informed Cruz that he faced 17 counts of premeditated murder and ordered him held without bond.\n\nIn a subsequent court proceeding, Gordon Weekes, chief assistant public defender in Broward County and part of Cruz's legal team, described the defendant as \"deeply disturbed, emotionally broken,\" and said he is on suicide watch. The defense is gathering Cruz's mental-health history and will explore his brain development and the possibility he had autism, according to Weekes.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Bennight, a bail bondsman in Mississippi, said he contacted the FBI after seeing a comment from \"nikolas cruz\" on one of his YouTube posts. He also said he reported the comment as spam to YouTube, which took it down. The FBI visited Bennight at the time and returned Wednesday, he confirmed in an interview.\n\nA white supremacist group, Republic of Florida, told the Anti-Defamation League that Cruz was affiliated with the group, according to an ADL spokesman. The Republic of Florida didn't return calls for comment.\n\nFormer Douglas high-school student Kyle Ramos, who knew Cruz from the Army Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, said Cruz liked to get up early, around 6 a.m., and try to kill squirrels outside his house by shooting them with a pellet gun.\n\nThe shooting has sparked calls for a national conversation on gun control and mental health, with Broward County Public Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie putting the focus on weapons. \"Now is the time for this country to have a real conversation on sensible gun-control laws,\" he said. \"Our students are asking for that conversation.\"",
    " Title: Jobs Report Shows Modest Growth, Leaves Economic Impact on Election Unchanged\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest jobs report, released on Friday, showed a gain of 171,000 jobs in October, exceeding most mainstream forecasts. This economic data has once again brought the economy to the forefront of the presidential campaign, as both candidates, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, reengage in their economic debate.\n\nThe jobs report, released just days before the election, presents a mixed picture of the U.S. economy. The job growth is a positive sign, but the increase in the unemployment rate to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent has denied President Obama a chance to tout a quickening recovery as he makes his final pitch to voters.\n\nBoth campaigns have used the report to reinforce their economic messages. Romney criticized Obama, stating that the unemployment rate is higher today than when Obama took office, while Obama highlighted the continuing trend of job growth as a reason to continue his economic policies.\n\nThe October jobs growth is in line with the recent trend and is unlikely to significantly impact the election. Economists such as Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, have stated that the job numbers are not strong enough to help the president or weak enough to help Romney. John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo, also noted that the report might be a modest benefit to Obama but does not change the overall picture of the economy.\n\nWith swing-state polls suggesting Obama is slightly ahead, he did not need a home run number on Friday. He just needed to avoid disaster and he certainly did that. Romney, on the other hand, arguably needed a much more dismal reading in order to crank up the heat on his closing argument that Obama has failed miserably on the economy and must be replaced.\n\nOverall, the October jobs report shows a modest growth in the U.S. economy, but it is unlikely to significantly impact the outcome of the election. The economy will continue to be a key issue in the final days of the campaign, as both candidates seek to convince voters that they are the best candidate to lead the country.",
    " Title: Chicago Police-ICE Agreement Sparks Concern Among Immigrant Rights Activists Ahead of City Council Vote on Sanctuary Law Amendments\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Chicago City Council prepares to vote on amendments to the city's \"sanctuary\" law, a recently disclosed agreement between the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has raised concerns among immigrant rights activists. The agreement, signed by former CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson in April, designates certain CPD employees as \"customs officers\" with the authority to enforce federal offenses, but not administrative violations of immigration law.\n\nCPD spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi stated that no department employees are currently deputized as \"customs officers,\" but defended the agreement, arguing it allows police to investigate drug trafficking, human trafficking, gangs, and financial crimes through Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a branch of ICE.\n\n\"Chicago, like many other major cities, has the authority to appoint officers to conduct joint state and federal investigations with Homeland Security Investigations,\" Guglielmi said. \"This is not a partnership in immigration enforcement.\"\n\nHowever, Guglielmi's assurances do not appease Rey Wences, a member of Organized Communities Against Deportations, who helped draft amendments to the Welcoming Cities ordinance that are set for a full City Council vote on Wednesday. The amendments prohibit CPD from assisting ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and Homeland Security Investigations in enforcing civil immigration operations and require the department to keep track of every request for assistance it receives.\n\nWences expressed concern about the agreement between CPD and ICE, stating, \"Police-ICE collaboration is police-ICE collaboration, no matter how you paint it. The existence of this agreement... makes you wonder what other kinds of agreements the city has [with ICE].\"\n\nAld. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th) and Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd), who introduced the amendments in December with Mayor Lori Lightfoot, were also unaware of the agreement.\n\n\"The agreement goes against the spirit of the Welcoming Cities ordinance,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nThe mayor's office and ICE officials did not respond to requests for comments Tuesday.\n\nThe Homeland Security Investigations office was created in 2010 to handle a range of criminal investigations such as weapons smuggling and child sex tourism. ICE has routinely insisted Homeland Security Investigations is separate from its Enforcement and Removal Operations, which handles all deportations. However, under the Trump administration, the line between both branches of ICE has blurred.\n\nIn 2017, former ICE acting director Tom Homan instructed Homeland Security Investigations to increase time spent on worksite raids \"by four to five times.\" Within two years, Homeland Security Investigations had conducted several high-profile raids across the country, including a raid of seven food processing plants in Mississippi that resulted in nearly 700 undocumented immigrant workers being detained (almost half of whom were released the next day).\n\nA 2019 report by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, the National Immigrant Justice Center, and the National Immigration Law Center criticized Homeland Security Investigations for engaging in racial profiling as it targets criminal gangs across the country.\n\n\"It is no longer a secret that HSI agents use the 'gang' label as a cover for engaging in widespread round-ups of immigrant youth of color,\" the report states.\n\nSimilar concerns have been raised in Boston, a fellow sanctuary city, where a similar agreement between the local police department and ICE led to widespread criticism after it was revealed that officials \"regularly offer information back and forth between the agencies.\"\n\nGuglielmi maintains that such incidents will not occur in Chicago and is confident that CPD officers will adhere to the Welcoming Cities ordinance.\n\n\"Our core focus of this department is to protect every resident of the city. We don't care where you were born,\" he said.\n\nFreddy Martinez, a policy analyst at Open the Government who obtained a copy of the CPD-ICE agreement through an open records request, questioned the cooperation between immigration authorities and sanctuary cities.\n\n\"We know ICE uses deceptive practices to get CPD to cooperate with them on immigration enforcement, with or without their knowledge,\" Martinez said. \"Significant questions remain about why [CPD] felt the need to enter into these types of agreements when there are no officers deputized to assist ICE.\"",
    " Title: Iran's Economic Struggles Persist Despite President Rouhani's Promises of Relief\n\nIran's economy may be struggling, but the desire for change and improvement is palpable among its citizens. In the bustling city of Tehran, a downtown restaurant serves as a microcosm of the country's economic landscape. A well-dressed young man, identified as Ahmad, sits with a friend, discussing the economic climate under President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nAhmad, who is involved in the petrochemical business and independent trading, expresses a common sentiment that Rouhani has brought a more positive atmosphere to the country but has yet to deliver on economic changes. Ahmad's personal struggles, such as the high tariffs on imported cars, may not resonate with many Iranians grappling with more pressing economic issues.\n\nIncome inequality is one of the challenges Rouhani faces, but the Iranian president remains optimistic about his country's economic future. Iranians are pinning their hopes on a nuclear agreement and improved relations with the international community, which are seen as difficult to achieve.\n\nAnother significant hurdle for Rouhani is the opposition from entrenched interests that profit from Iran's isolation, such as the powerful Revolutionary Guard. In the poor neighborhoods of south Tehran, the economic struggles are more evident. Iran remains an economy of subsidies, with some direct cash payments replaced by food baskets for the poor.\n\nIn these areas, the economic hardships are more recognizable, but flashes of humor can still be found. An old man in a wool cap startles a reporter by shouting, \"We chant 'Death to America' all the time! What are you doing here asking questions?\" However, his comrades break into grins, and he smiles, acknowledging the reporter's presence.\n\nMehdi, a 77-year-old resident, makes it clear that they need help, but they do not appreciate food lines. \"This is the fourth time I've come,\" Mehdi says. \"They tell me to come back later, and then they say they've run out. It's not right.\"\n\nBeyond a slight easing of sanctions last month, Iran has benefited from the widespread conviction that Rouhani's economic team is more competent than its predecessor's. Greater confidence, along with limited success in nuclear negotiations with six world powers, has helped reverse Iran's brutal inflation rate and stabilized the Iranian rial against the dollar.\n\nHowever, achieving more will require the lifting of sanctions by further curtailing Iran's nuclear program, an effort that faces opposition both at home and abroad. Conservative Israeli and U.S. watchdogs such as United Against Nuclear Iran express concerns that \"the architecture of the sanctions regime is crumbling,\" largely based on an increase in trade delegations visiting Iran and inflated Iranian predictions.\n\nPresident Obama has stated that Washington will come down \"like a ton of bricks\" on those who violate sanctions. Inside Iran, people are not seeing improvements that would justify such concerns. Even the man in charge of making Iran's oil contracts more attractive to foreign companies is tempering expectations.\n\nOil ministry official Mehdi Hosseini states that Iran needs a massive $150 billion in foreign investment in the coming years, and so far, companies are not committing. \"We still have sanctions now,\" Hosseini says. \"There are companies coming and going, but we can't sign contracts while the sanctions remain, and contract talks will take time.\"\n\nFor now, Iranians say, there's nothing to do but struggle on, recognizing that better times ahead depend on factors beyond their control.",

The Associated Press first reported the firing, citing officials.\n\nThe firing was allegedly prompted by a statement from Goldstein on Tuesday, in which he stated that Tillerson did not speak with Trump before his dismissal and was \"unaware\" of the reason behind his termination. This statement suggested that Tillerson may have found out about his firing through Twitter, though it contradicts published accounts of the decision that cited unnamed White House sources.\n\nGoldstein's account differed from that of a White House official, who stated that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly informed Tillerson on Friday that Trump would fire him. President Trump, on the other hand, stated on Tuesday that he made the decision to oust Tillerson on his own and that Tillerson would be \"much happier now.\"\n\nTrump and Tillerson had reportedly clashed on several occasions, most notably after reports that Tillerson referred to Trump as a \"moron\" in private. The White House announced later on Tuesday that Heather Nauert, previously the State Department's spokesperson, had been named as Goldstein's replacement.",
    " Title: Top 10 Standout Segments from \"The Daily Show\" and \"The Colbert Report\" in 2013: A Year in Review of Satire and Parody\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the tumultuous year of 2013, America witnessed a plethora of controversial events, from the NSA's surveillance to the government shutdown, and the release of the questionable song \"Accidental Racist.\" In the midst of these events, \"The Daily Show\" and \"The Colbert Report\" provided a much-needed dose of humor and satire. Here are ten of the best moments from the two shows:\n\n1. Stephen Colbert and Alan Cumming's musical parody, \"Oopsie Daisy Homophobe,\" took aim at the controversial song \"Accidental Racist\" by LL Cool J and Brad Paisley.\n\n2. John Oliver's three-part series on gun control in Australia, which investigated the strict gun control measures implemented after mass shootings, and the U.S.'s failure to adopt similar measures.\n\n3. Jessica Williams' segments on race in America, particularly her piece on food stamps and the hypocrisy of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's stop-and-frisk program.\n\n4. Colbert's anger-fueled segment following Daft Punk's last-minute withdrawal from a \"Colbert Report\" performance, which turned out to be a hilarious critique of the band's VMA performance.\n\n5. Aasif Mandvi's expose on North Carolina GOP leader Don Yelton, who made controversial comments about voter ID laws and racial minorities.\n\n6. The \"Daily Show's\" annual skewering of Fox News' War on Christmas, with a particular focus on Megyn Kelly's outrage over a black Santa Claus.\n\n7. The Best F#@king News Team Ever's parody of CNN's shoddy news coverage, which showcased the network's inaccuracies and sensationalism.\n\n8. Jon Stewart's rage-filled verbal assaults on the GOP during the government shutdown, particularly his labeling of House Republicans as \"self-righteous Orwellian zebra queefs.\"\n\n9. The return of CNN's \"Crossfire,\" parodied by Colbert in the program \"Pointless Counter Pointless,\" featuring special guests Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird debating trivial topics.\n\n10. A less humorous, but memorable moment, was former President Bill Clinton's admission of his insecurity with Twitter and his subsequent joining of the social media site under the handle \"PrezBillyJeff.\"",
    " Title: Republican Voters Support Gun Control Measures, but GOP Institution Remains Hostile to Gun Control Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, the Democratic Party has called on the GOP-controlled Senate to take action on gun control, particularly to pass a bill that would establish universal background checks. However, the Republican Party's stance on gun control remains a contentious issue, as polls show that while Republican voters prioritize gun rights, they are not universally opposed to restrictions on firearms.\n\nAccording to polls, most Republicans support expanding background checks, \"red flag\" provisions allowing the police to take guns away from people deemed dangerous by a judge, and requiring a license to purchase a gun. Yet, the Republican Party as an institution remains hostile to gun control measures.\n\nThe political consequences of backing gun control measures are significant for Republican elected officials. If a Republican elected official votes for a gun control measure, they could potentially be labeled \"anti-gun\" and face electoral vulnerability. This is due, in part, to the fact that gun ownership is tied to the dominant political identity within the GOP, and views on guns are connected to broader conservative political beliefs.\n\nMoreover, the Republican Party is aggressively working to expand gun rights at the state level, such as allowing people to carry concealed weapons without permits. The party also lacks a significant pro-gun control power, with no countervailing force promoting gun control within the GOP. The National Rifle Association (NRA) is a powerful force in GOP politics, exerting constant pressure and having a huge number of single-issue voters who could potentially walk away from a representative over the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while a majority of voters overall and a sizable bloc of GOP voters would likely support gun control measures, a more comprehensive measure or group of measures faces significant barriers with a Republican-controlled Senate and a GOP president. The Republican Party's stance on gun control remains a contentious issue, and it is unlikely that the party will move too much anytime soon.",
    " Title: Hydroxychloroquine, Malaria Drug, Shows Promise in Coronavirus Treatment, but More Data Needed for Firm Conclusion\n\nA drug used to treat malaria is showing promise in lab and clinical studies for coronavirus, leading to reserved enthusiasm among some scientists. French researchers found that hydroxychloroquine lowered virus levels in most patients who took part in a clinical study this month. The results of a clinical trial in France and studies conducted in lab settings are building hope that a drug usually used to treat malaria and arthritis can treat and possibly cure coronavirus patients, though scientists say more data is needed before drawing a firm conclusion.\n\nPresident Donald Trump asked the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force about possibly using the drug during a briefing on Wednesday. Task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said the drug is being studied \"very carefully,\" as are several other potential therapeutics.\n\nOn Tuesday, a team of French scientists released the first results of a clinical study of the use of hydroxychloroquine on 24 coronavirus patients from southeast France. The research team, led by Didier Raoult, a renowned infectious disease expert from l\u2019Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire in Marseille, administered the drug for 10 days along with azithromycin, a common antibiotic.\n\nResearchers said the drugs cleared the virus in the nose and throat of most observed patients in three to six days. The study found that after six days of treatment, 70 percent of patients administered hydroxychloroquine were clear of the virus, compared to just 12.5 percent of patients who were not given drugs. Azithromycin boosted the effect of hydroxychloroquine, according to the study. After six days of treatment, all patients treated with the drug combination \"were virologically cured,\" compared to 57.1 percent of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine by itself.\n\n\"We therefore recommend that COVID-19 patients be treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to cure their infection and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the world,\" wrote researchers, who acknowledged the small sample size of the study.\n\nLab studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine, which was developed in the 1940s, inhibited coronavirus. A study published in Cell Discovery on Wednesday by three Chinese scientists found that hydroxychloroquine inhibited coronavirus in vitro, or in a lab culture.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, the dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor School of Medicine, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation he was \"enthusiastic\" about early results of studies involving hydroxychloroquine, though he said more data is needed to determine if the drug can effectively treat coronavirus.\n\n\"We urgently need to accelerate new antimicrobial therapies. If hydroxychloroquine could be approved in therapy it would be a game-changer,\" Hotez said. \"The important next step is to show that it has an impact on reducing severity of symptoms in clinical disease.\"\n\nHotez said that an ideal study would be conducted in areas with high rates of transmission, such as the Lombardy region in Italy. More clinical trials are underway. A researcher at Asan Medical Center, a top research hospital in South Korea, is conducting a clinical trial of 150 patients with mild cases of coronavirus. The lead researcher, Sung-Han Kim, estimates that the trial will be completed in May.\n\nAccording to NBC News, French drug maker Sanofi is working with health authorities to study whether hydroxychloroquine can help with coronavirus. The company is encouraged by preliminary findings, according to NBC News, but still does not have enough data to determine its efficacy.\n\nHealth officials in Belgium and South Korea have recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for patients displaying either severe or mild symptoms from COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus. The United Kingdom appears to have some hope for the drug. On Sunday, government officials there banned the export and hoarding of hydroxychloroquine and two other drugs that could be useful as therapeutics, according to Pharmaceutical Technology.",
    " Title: Former Benghazi Investigator Alleges Partisan Shift in Committee's Focus\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with CNN's \"State of the Union,\" a former investigator for the Select Committee on Benghazi, Air Force Reserve Maj. Bradley Podliska, has claimed that the investigation, initially non-partisan, shifted its focus towards former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Podliska, who was dismissed from his position, alleges that he was let go partially for not focusing his investigation heavily enough on Clinton, who was the U.S. Secretary of State during the 2012 Benghazi attack that resulted in the death of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.\n\nHowever, on Sunday, the chairman of the House panel, Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, released a statement denying Podliska's allegations. Gowdy stated that the committee is seeking a \"definitive accounting\" of the attacks, and that Podliska was improperly focused on Clinton.\n\nPodliska, a self-proclaimed conservative Republican who once interned for the conservative Media Research Center, maintains that his allegations are not partisan. He stated, \"I would just like to state that I am going to vote for the Republican nominee in 2016. I do not support Hillary Clinton for president.\"\n\nPodliska further asserted, \"Hillary Clinton has a lot of explaining to do. We, however, did not need to shift resources to hyperfocus on Hillary Clinton. We did not need to de-emphasize, and in some cases drop, the investigation on different agencies, different organizations, and different individuals.\"\n\nIn response, the Benghazi committee issued a statement vigorously denying all of Podliska's allegations. The statement claimed that Podliska was terminated, in part, because he himself manifested improper partiality and animus in his investigative work. The committee also accused Podliska of imagining \"a variety of new, outlandish, never previously mentioned allegations since his departure.\"\n\nPodliska told CNN that the victims' families are not going to get the truth. He stated, \"I know this because the nine months of research I had done is not lost. I have no idea where it is, and I know that I could give those victims' families... a pretty thorough explanation of why they were told that this attack was due to a video.\"",
    " Title: The Government Shutdown: A Standoff Over DACA and the Fate of Dreamers\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, the recent government shutdown has been labeled as the \"Dreamer shutdown\" by some, as the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Dreamers has become the central issue in the ongoing political standoff.\n\nIllegal immigrant Dreamers, who have been advocating for citizenship rights, pressured Democrats to block funding for the government unless the bill granted them permanent protection. On Friday, Democrats heeded this call, mounting a filibuster of a four-week spending bill, denying the government the necessary funds to remain open.\n\nDreamers celebrated the shutdown, stating they were finally being taken seriously. Cata Santiago, a Dreamer, said in a statement, \"We know that the public is on our side. We are calling for the immigrant community and our allies to take to the streets immediately to demand that Congress pass legislation guaranteeing permanent protection for immigrant youth NOW.\"\n\nDozens of Dreamers were present in the Senate's viewing galleries on Friday night, watching as the drama unfolded beneath them. Police were in force outside the galleries, prepared for potential protests and mass arrests, but there were no disturbances.\n\nSenators seemed stunned by the turn of events, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell admitting, \"Almost everybody on both sides doesn't understand how we ended up here.\" He laid blame squarely at the feet of the Dreamer debate, stating that Democrats held the entire process hostage to the immigration talks.\n\nDemocrats suggested there were other sticking points, but acknowledged immigration and the fate of the Dreamers was the chief hurdle. However, they said the hold-up was President Trump's demands for major changes in immigration policy, which the White House said had to be passed along with any action on Dreamers.\n\nThe Dreamers and their immigrant-rights allies now find themselves in a similar position as conservative and tea party groups, who pressured Republicans into an Obamacare-fueled shutdown in 2013. That shutdown lasted 16 days, and Republicans relented in the end, walking away with no substantive gains.\n\nDreamers are likely to emerge from this shutdown in better shape, with most lawmakers saying they do want to find a solution for them. Early Saturday morning, after the votes, Dreamers stood outside the Capitol in small groups, awaiting the outcome. For now, the Dreamers await along with the rest of the country to see the outcome, though they were emboldened by their show of political power.\n\nFrank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigration lobby group, said, \"Our fight has never been about a government shutdown; it's about a policy breakthrough. It's not about political advantage; it's about people's lives.\"\n\nDeemed the most sympathetic figures in the immigration debate, most Dreamers were brought to the U.S. by parents with little say in the decision, and many don't have substantive memories of their home countries. They began \"coming out\" as illegal immigrants in the last decade, and quickly became a political force, earning invitations to the State of the Union address, meeting at the White House with President Barack Obama, and addressing the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThey came close to a solution in 2010, when legislation known as the Dream Act\u2014which they took their name from\u2014cleared the House and came close to passing the Senate, falling in a GOP-led filibuster. Their power has grown in the years since, and they felt emboldened last year to demand a shutdown fight. Democrats balked the first few times, but finally agreed to a self-imposed Jan. 19 deadline for action.\n\nHowever, the actual firm deadline for Dreamers is March 5, which is when President Trump's phaseout of the Obama-era DACA deportation amnesty, protecting some 690,000 Dreamers, begins to expire. More than 100 Dreamers are losing status each day right now, but those are ones who didn't manage to renew their status by Homeland Security's Oct. 5 deadline.\n\nSen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who has led the fight on their behalf for years, said it was a travesty for Congress to have not solved their situation. \"To say we're in no hurry\u2014well, we may not be as senators and congressmen, but these young people are in a hurry to find out whether or not they have a life. That's what it comes down to,\" Mr. Durbin said.\n\nRepublicans countered that they, too, wanted to grant long-term certainty to Dreamers, but didn't want a new amnesty to invite another wave of illegal immigration. They demanded more border security and other policy changes be tied to any Dreamer legislation.\n\n\"We can not deal with the issue of individuals in our country illegally...and ignore how it happened in the first place,\" said Sen. James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican. The standoff continues, with the future of the Dreamers and the government hanging in the balance.",
    " Title: Unemployment Rates Vary Widely Across U.S. States, With Some States Seeing Unprecedented Job Growth and Others Struggling\n\nArticle:\n\nThe disparity in the economic recovery across different U.S. states is evident in the stark contrast of unemployment rates, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for June. While five states have unemployment rates below 4%, several other states, particularly those with industrial backgrounds or poor populations, are still grappling with high unemployment rates.\n\nFive states, including Vermont with an unemployment rate of 3.5% in June, have extraordinary jobless figures. These states are primarily located in the Great Plains, where an energy boom has contributed to the economy. North Dakota, with its rich shale resources, had a jobless rate of a mere 2.7% in June. Nebraska and Utah followed closely with unemployment rates of 3.5%, while South Dakota's rate was 3.8%. Wyoming, with a population of 578,759, was the only state with a 4% unemployment rate.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, employment remains high in several formerly industrial states and states with poor populations. Rhode Island, which has lost many factory workers and people from the financial services industry, had an unemployment rate of 7.9% in June. Mississippi, one of the poorest states in the country based on median household income, also had an unemployment rate of 7.9%. In another poor state, Kentucky, the jobless rate is 7.4%, and it is higher in the eastern counties that were once a center of coal production. Illinois, one of the most factory-rich northern states, had an unemployment rate of 7.1% in June. Michigan's was 7.5%, and Nevada, home to the greatest real estate collapse of the Great Recession, which gutted construction jobs, had a jobless rate of 7.7%.\n\nIt is evident that if the U.S. economy is to have a normal, fully recovered jobless rate of 5% or better, these most troubled states have a long way to go to contribute. There is nothing in their economic compositions that makes such a recovery likely.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a financial news and commentary partner offering content independently of \u2588\u2588\u2588.",
    " Title: \"The Debate Over Extended Unemployment Benefits: A Look at the Controversial $600 Weekly Boost and Its Impact on the Economy\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the unprecedented $2 trillion stimulus package passed in March, one of the most contentious issues has emerged: the extension of unemployment benefits. With nearly 39 million Americans filing for unemployment in the past nine weeks, the enhanced benefits, which provide an additional $600 per week from the federal government, are set to expire on July 31 unless Congress votes to extend them.\n\nThe enhanced benefits, when combined with state-level payments, have created a situation where some workers are earning more on unemployment than they would if they returned to work. This has sparked a heated debate, with proponents arguing that the extra funds have helped stave off a more severe economic collapse, while opponents claim it will hinder the country's economic recovery by discouraging people from returning to work.\n\nThe issue is expected to be a key point of contention as Congress considers its next stimulus bill in the coming weeks. House Democrats have proposed a bill that would continue the $600 bonus through the end of January, while Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham stated that the GOP would oppose such an extension.\n\nOpponents of extending the enhanced benefits argue that it will hold back the country's economic recovery by providing an incentive for people to stay home rather than return to work. They contend that this could lead to businesses suffering if employees refuse to accept what would effectively be a pay cut by going back to work when stay-at-home orders are lifted. The situation could also create resentment among essential workers who have remained on the job during the crisis for less pay than those who were laid off.\n\nProponents of continuing the enhanced payments argue that the extra money has helped many people make ends meet during these challenging times. They also point out that the larger checks mean people have money to spend, which helps businesses stay afloat. If the extra funds go away, the country could see a wave of evictions, foreclosures, and other secondary economic impacts that could lead to a prolonged and severe recession, some economists have warned.\n\nPublic health experts argue that the enhanced benefits are an important part of limiting the spread of coronavirus, which they see as the top priority. Not only would extending the enhanced benefits save lives, but lessening the severity of the outbreak would also ultimately benefit the economy more than a premature rush to push people back into the workplace, they say.\n\nAs of now, Republicans in the Senate have yet to release a plan for their next stimulus package. The earliest any legislation could move forward will be the first week of June, when senators return from a weeklong recess. The debate over the extended unemployment benefits is shaping up to be a significant point of contention in the ongoing economic recovery discussions.",
    " Title: Obama's Healthcare Overhaul: A Test of Progressivism's Reputation and the Future of Liberalism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe rollout of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare overhaul, commonly known as Obamacare, has put the reputation of Big Government progressivism at risk for at least this generation. The success or failure of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) now rests on the president's ability to reverse the debacle and demonstrate that his approach to covering millions of uninsured Americans is not only an enlightened but workable policy.\n\nIn his 2006 best-selling book, \"The Audacity of Hope,\" Obama dismissed the achievements of the most recent Democratic president, Bill Clinton. He criticized Clinton's policies as \"recognizably progressive if modest in their goals.\" These words take on new significance in light of the ACA's success or failure.\n\nThe future of the Democratic Party's plausible agenda and of liberalism itself is at stake, as both emboldened conservatives and worried liberals agree. The challenge for Obama is to ensure that the cycle of progressivism he presumed to usher in and the period of renewed faith and confidence in the transformative powers of government does not die aborning.\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who helped launch the centrist \"New Democratic\" agenda in the 1990s, said, \"Unlike the Republican agenda, the Democratic agenda does not work unless people have a certain level of trust in the competence of the government to act on their behalf.\"\n\nConservative thinkers have seized on the rocky rollout of Obamacare as proof positive that the age-old argument over the proper role of state action in American life has reached a fresh danger point for the Democrats. The unraveling of Obamacare could catastrophically undermine the ideology of ever-expansive central government providing cradle-to-grave care for an ever-grateful citizenry.\n\nAnxious congressional Democrats face a fight-or-flight dilemma of their own. For all their worries, abandoning Obamacare is no easy proposition. They supported its creation and understand that their constituents need health care reform\u2014they cannot continue with the flawed old system that left so many shut out.\n\nThe White House, for its part, pooh-poohs such doomsday talk. \"This is obviously a challenge, and we're facing the challenge, and we're up to the challenge,\" press secretary Jay Carney insisted on Friday.\n\nHowever, more dispassionate analysts\u2014even sympathetic ones\u2014say it would be hard to overstate the danger of this moment for Obama and for Democrats more broadly. From the beginning, Obama sketched his agenda for the country as the sort that succeeds only once a generation, if then.",
    " Title: Central American Migrant Caravan Arrives at U.S.-Mexico Border Despite Trump's Warnings\n\nA group of Central American migrants, numbering around 600, traveling together in a caravan through Mexico, have arrived at the border city of Tijuana late on Tuesday, despite warnings from U.S. President Donald Trump that it would be futile to attempt crossing to claim asylum in the United States.\n\nBy evening, two busloads of men, women, and children, who have been on a month-long journey that began near Mexico's southern border with Guatemala, arrived in Tijuana, a city that borders southern California. The migrants, who have fled their homes in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras due to lethal threats or political persecution, have held onto the hope of receiving asylum in the United States. However, their prospects have diminished after U.S. authorities released statements on Monday stating they would be turned back.\n\nRodrigo Abeja, a coordinator from immigrant rights group Pueblo Sin Fronteras, which has organized similar caravans for several years, said the caravan would regroup before making any decisions. \"They will wait for all those seeking asylum to be together,\" Abeja said.\n\nAnother four busloads were making their way north from Hermosillo, a city 432 miles south of the border, where the migrants had been stalled for days. A third group, resigned to staying in Mexico, awaited processing for year-long visas by immigration authorities in Hermosillo.\n\nThe number of migrants traveling together has decreased from a peak of about 1,500 people, due to the twin pressures of waiting for transportation and attacks by President Trump, who began criticizing the caravan on Twitter in early April. After Trump's comments, Mexican authorities stalled the caravan in a southern town and began handing out temporary visas that gave them legal status to travel to the border.",
    " Title: Hurricane Hermine Makes Landfall in Florida, Threatens East Coast\n\nArticle:\n\nHurricane Hermine, the first hurricane to hit Florida in over a decade, made landfall early Friday morning in the Big Bend area, where Florida's peninsula and panhandle meet. The storm caused power outages, damage from storm surges, and flooding in coastal communities.\n\nAs of Saturday, Hermine had weakened to a tropical storm, but the National Hurricane Center predicted it would regain hurricane strength over the weekend and potentially impact coastal areas as far north as Connecticut and Rhode Island through Labor Day. The storm's projected path prompted New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to declare a state of emergency for three counties on the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn Florida, the main impact of Hermine was power outages and damage from storm surges. A homeless man south of Gainesville died when a tree fell on him, Governor Rick Scott said. Scott later visited coastal communities like Cedar Key and Steinhatchee, which were hit hard by the storm.\n\nIn Cedar Key, numerous homes were damaged, storage buildings were destroyed, and a 100-yard fishing pier was damaged. In Steinhatchee, a storm surge crashed into Bobbi Pattison's home, leaving her living room filled with overturned furniture and an acrid smell. Tiny crabs darted around her floor.\n\nIn Keaton Beach, about two dozen people were stranded due to flooding, with police blocking the road. Dustin Beach, 31, rushed there from a hospital in Tallahassee where his wife gave birth to a girl Thursday night to see if his home still stood.\n\nHigh winds knocked trees onto several houses in Tallahassee, injuring people inside. Alan Autry, 48, heard a large pine in his Tallahassee neighborhood start to crack and fall to the ground. The tree did not initially crash through the roof, and Autry and his wife went to a neighbor's house. Sometime before dawn, the corner of his house collapsed from the weight of the tree.\n\nTampa and St. Petersburg escaped major damage, with up to 17 inches of rain falling in the area over the last two days. The last hurricane to strike Florida was Wilma, a powerful Category 3 storm that arrived on Oct. 24, 2005. It caused five deaths in the state and an estimated $23 billion in damage.\n\nAs Hermine moves up the East Coast, it threatens a dangerous storm surge into Hampton Roads in southeast Virginia. The storm is expected to regain hurricane strength by Monday morning off the Maryland-Delaware coast before weakening again as it moves north. Tropical storm watches and warnings are posted up and down the coastline. Amtrak has cancelled or altered some service on the East Coast as the storm approaches.",
    " Title: New Zealand Mosque Attack Suspect's Manifesto and Social Media Posts Reveal Far-Right Influence and White Nationalist Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, the gunman's actions, manifesto, and social media posts have been analyzed, revealing a deep connection to the far-right online community and a white nationalist agenda.\n\nThe gunman's actions, paired with the typical trolling tactics of the internet's most far-right instigators, were designed to provoke a response and create division. His manifesto, a chilling document, states that one of his objectives was to \"agitate the political enemies of my people into action, to cause them to overextend their own hand and experience the eventual and inevitable backlash as a result.\"\n\nThe manifesto, filled with anti-Muslim sentiment, refers to nonwhites as \"invaders\" who threaten to \"replace\" white people. The author's choice of language and specific memes suggest a profound understanding of the far-right online community.\n\nThe gunman's weapons bore the names of centuries-old military leaders who led battles against largely nonwhite forces, as well as the names of men who recently carried out mass shootings of Jews and Muslims. His manifesto, steeped in anti-Muslim sentiment, also references the gunman's interest in history, particularly events that fit into a white nationalist narrative.\n\nThe link to the livestreamed video was first posted to the /pol/ forum of 8chan, a notorious far-right space, where the gunman was hailed as a hero after the shooting. Some of his references were subtle, such as his choice to listen to a song associated with a 1995 Serbian nationalist video, which has recently been co-opted as a racist meme, during his drive to the mosque.\n\nThe investigation into the shootings continues, and the world grapples with the aftermath of this horrific event, seeking to understand the motivations behind it and to prevent such tragedies from happening again.",
    " Title: Virginia's 7th District: A Tight Race Between Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Incumbent Dave Brat\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming U.S. congressional midterm elections, the race between Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican incumbent Dave Brat in Virginia's 7th District is shaping up to be a tight contest. The district, which includes parts of suburban Virginia, has been experiencing a shift away from the Republican party, making it a potential target for Democrats.\n\nLast week, at a campaign event in a martial arts studio, voters Meg Sneed and Cheryll Lesser, who had previously voted for Brat, listened to Spanberger. Their primary reason for attending was their disapproval of President Donald Trump, and they expressed their intention to vote against anyone who supports him, including Brat.\n\nThe discontent towards Trump is a significant factor in the Democrats' belief that they can win more than the 23 seats they need to seize control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Some predict that Democrats could take as many as 40 seats by flipping districts like Brat's in Virginia.\n\nEarlier this year, Brat's seat was considered safe. However, if a \"blue wave\" materializes, it could roll through a district like his, given the increasing number of suburban voters turning away from the Republicans. Doug Heye, a former official at the Republican National Committee, noted that Republicans are playing defense in more and more places, while the Democrats' map continues to expand.\n\nIf Democrats do take the House, much of Trump's agenda would be stalled, and his administration would face greater scrutiny. Republicans, on the other hand, are favored to retain the Senate. While Democrats need a net total of just two seats to control that chamber, they must also defend seats in several conservative states.\n\nDemocrats have poured resources into Brat's district, as well as other battleground districts, such as Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Southern California, and other parts of Virginia, like the district currently represented by Republican Scott Taylor. They have been backed by deep-pocketed advocacy groups like House Majority PAC and NextGen, funded by California billionaire Tom Steyer, which launched efforts to turn out young voters in the district.\n\nIn response, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican political action committee, is running ads attacking Spanberger, a sign that the party is genuinely worried about losing the seat.\n\nBrat, who shocked the political order by beating then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a Republican primary in 2014, has aligned himself with the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus. Last year, as protesters disrupted his events during a House push to repeal former President Barack Obama's healthcare program, Brat remarked that \"women are in my grille no matter where I go.\"\n\nIn September, Brat held his first town hall in a year, and he did so with a supportive audience of older veterans. Sarah Montgomery, a librarian for the U.S. Department of Defense who attended Spanberger's event in Spotsylvania, said that after Brat's district was redrawn in 2016 to include her home, she researched him, and the video of his \"grille\" remark was the first thing she found.\n\nThe firestorm over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault while in high school, came at a perilous moment for Brat, given his already difficult reputation with some women voters. Trump has played a part in this, as both Sneed and Lesser were angry that he chose to attack Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, at a rally last week.\n\nKavanaugh was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Saturday. Democratic activists hope discontent with his nomination will linger through November. Republicans, however, see the Kavanaugh fracas as galvanizing conservatives who have been looking for a reason to come out and vote in November's elections.\n\n\"It has mobilized and energized Republican voters in a way that only a Supreme Court nomination can,\" said Matt Gorman, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the arm of the party that supports House candidates like Brat.\n\nBrat has been a solid supporter of Kavanaugh, even though the House served no role in his nomination. Last week, he reasserted that support in a Facebook post. His campaign rejected the notion that he is not supportive of women, pointing to his efforts to combat human trafficking and the opioid epidemic and the passage of tax reform last year.\n\nA 39-year-old former officer for the Central Intelligence Agency, Spanberger presents herself as the face of the Resistance, the woman-driven protest movement against Trump. However, she has been careful to not alienate the independent and moderate voters she needs to win the district. At the Spotsylvania event, she didn't mention Trump, Brat, or Kavanaugh, focusing on domestic-policy issues such as healthcare and education.\n\nAsked for her position on Kavanaugh's nomination, her campaign declined to comment. Instead, Spanberger touched on the thing that attracted voters such as Meg Sneed to her: turning down the volume in the civic discourse.\n\n\"We've reached a place where we need to restore a level of civility to our conversations,\" she told the crowd.\n\nTom Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia, said it remains Brat's race to win, and that Kavanaugh may be the issue that pulls him over the finish line. \"It's still a southern district,\" Davis said. \"There's nothing like a good fight to keep your base in line.\"",
    " Title: The Impact of Economic Transition on Life Expectancy: A Comparative Analysis of Hong Kong and Central Europe\n\nArticle:\n\nLast Friday, the Cato Institute hosted a forum on Neil Monnery's book, \"Architect of Prosperity: Sir John Cowperthwaite and the Making of Hong Kong.\" Sir John Cowperthwaite, the financial secretary of Hong Kong from 1961 to 1971 and its financial under-secretary from 1951 to 1961, played a significant role in establishing policies that have been credited for transforming a poor British colony into one of the world's wealthiest regions.\n\nDuring the discussion, Monnery highlighted that in the years following World War II, Hong Kong's per capita income was one-third of that in Britain. By the time of the British transfer of the territory to China in 1997, incomes in the two countries were equal. Today, the average inhabitant of Hong Kong is over 30% richer than the average Briton.\n\nEconomic growth, Monnery argued, is not only crucial for rising standards of living but also for health and life expectancy. In the 1960s, people in Hong Kong lived four years shorter than their British counterparts. Today, they live four years longer. This correlation between economic growth and life expectancy was a key point of discussion.\n\nThis got me thinking about the changes that Central Europe underwent since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the 28th anniversary of which we will commemorate on November 9. Following the end of the communist period, the region experienced an economic recession, as unproductive industries shut down, and millions of people lost their jobs. Life expectancy started to decline, which opponents of market reforms saw as proof positive of capitalism's deleterious consequences for people's welfare.\n\nRevisiting life expectancy statistics some three decades later, a different picture emerges. Between 1960, the first year for which World Bank data is available, and 1989 (i.e., a period of 29 years), life expectancy in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia rose by 1.33, 1.46, 3.36, and 1.05 years, respectively. Between 1989 and 2015 (i.e., a period of 26 years), it increased by 7.1, 5.68, 6.44, and 5.24 years, respectively. The post-communist dip in life expectancy, such as it was, proved to be small and temporary.\n\nFurther afield, post-communist depression was much more pronounced in the Baltic countries, which is, in retrospect, unsurprising. These economies, being parts of the Soviet Union, were much more heavily distorted than their neighbors to the west. In other words, a deeper restructuring was necessary.\n\nHowever, the relationship between economic growth and life expectancy still holds. In the 31 years between 1960 and 1991 (i.e., the year of the dissolution of the U.S.S.R.), life expectancy in Estonia and Lithuania rose by 1.47 and 0.52 years, respectively, while in Latvia it fell by.75 years. Between 1991 and 2015 (i.e., a period of 24 years), life expectancy rose by 7.33 years in Estonia, 2.97 years in Lithuania, and 5.02 years in Latvia.\n\nIn conclusion, a switch from socialism to capitalism appears to be good for the health and longevity of the citizenry. The correlation between economic growth and life expectancy, as demonstrated by the cases of Hong Kong and Central Europe, suggests that economic policies promoting growth and development can significantly impact the well-being and lifespan of a nation's population.",
    " Title: Deadly Bombing Rocks Bangkok's Downtown Area, Killing 18 and Injuring Over 100\n\nA devastating bomb blast rocked a popular shopping and tourism district in Bangkok during the evening rush hour on Monday, leaving at least 18 people dead and over 100 injured, according to authorities.\n\nThe explosion occurred near the Erawan Shrine, a Hindu religious site, with the blast's full force hitting people in the area. The BBC reported that body parts were scattered and a crater was present, indicating a bombing. Burned motorbikes were also seen on the road.\n\nInitial reports suggested a second explosion was possible, but national police chief Somyot Poompummuang later confirmed that the suspicious object found near the blast site was harmless.\n\nThe exact cause of the explosion remains unclear, but the Bangkok Post reported that an improvised explosive device was placed inside the shrine complex and detonated at 6:55 p.m. local time. The blast set motorbikes and taxis ablaze near the Rajprasong intersection, a site of political protests in recent years.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwan condemned the bombing and expressed condolences to the families of the deceased and injured. He stated that it was too soon to determine if the attack was politically motivated.\n\nThe White House also condemned the attack and extended condolences to those affected by the explosion. The U.S. will remain in close contact with Thai authorities investigating the blast.\n\nWhile such attacks are rare in Bangkok, there have been smaller incidents in recent months, including a small homemade pipe bomb explosion near a shopping mall in February and grenade attacks in March and April.\n\nIt is not yet clear why the shrine was targeted. Thailand is predominantly Buddhist, with Hindus making up a small fraction of the population. Approximately 5% of the population is Islamic, and there has been some religious unrest involving Islamic separatists in southern Thailand in recent years.\n\nThailand experienced a military coup in May 2014, and the government was dissolved, replaced by a military-dominated national legislature. The current prime minister, Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha, has cracked down on dissent and banned criticism of his government.\n\nWitnesses described the chaos and panic that ensued after the explosion. Anna Mallika, a Thai-American auditor, was in an exercise class when the blast hit. \"We heard the most almighty bang,\" Mallika said. \"Most of us thought that something was wrong, but the instructor told us that it was probably just a car crash or something like that. Minutes later we saw people running and panicking outside the window.\"\n\nRichard Sri-kureja told the BBC he was walking to a mall next to the shrine when he heard the blast. \"There was total chaos,\" he said. \"That area is usually very, very crowded as it's in the middle of the city and it's usually very packed. A local hotel is full of injured patients.\"\n\nThe investigation into the bombing is ongoing.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Border Wall Funding Case Rejected by Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Trump administration's bid to secure funding for the construction of a border wall without congressional authorization has been rejected by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court upheld a lower court's ruling that blocked the Defense Department from reallocating $2.5 billion from its budget for the border wall project.\n\nThe case began in May when a federal district judge in Oakland, Calif., Haywood Gilliam Jr., a former federal prosecutor appointed by President Obama, issued a preliminary ruling blocking the Defense Department from spending money that Congress had not appropriated for the border wall. The administration then sought a stay of Judge Gilliam's order, but the judge refused, and a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled 2-1 to uphold his refusal.\n\nThe administration claimed an emergency, stating that construction contracts had to be in place by the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30 for the project to proceed. However, the appeals court majority wrote that the Constitution assigns the power of the purse to Congress, and it is Congress that is to make decisions regarding how to spend taxpayer dollars.\n\nThis case marks the 28th time, according to Prof. Stephen Vladeck of the University of Texas School of Law, that the Trump administration has sought Supreme Court intervention of this sort, compared to six times for the administration of President George W. Bush and four times for the Obama administration in their respective eight-year terms.\n\nThe Trump administration's repeated attempts to bypass the appeals court and seek direct review from the Supreme Court have raised concerns about a historic change in the attitude and behavior of a presidential administration towards the Supreme Court. The skepticism stems from the administration's approach to the court, which may sometimes aim to lose cases and use the Supreme Court as a foil. The administration's actions are under close and critical scrutiny.",
    " Title: President Obama Expresses Optimism on Immigration Bill, Sen. Schumer Reports 90% Progress in Gang of Eight Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Barack Obama expressed optimism on Wednesday that Congress will have a bill that overhauls the nation's immigration laws ready next month and that passage of the legislation can be completed by summer's end.\n\nIn an interview with the Spanish-language network Telemundo, Obama stated, \"If we have a bill introduced at the beginning of next month as these senators indicate it will be, then I'm confident that we can get it done certainly before the end of the summer.\"\n\nThe president's comments come as four members of the Senate's so-called \"Gang of Eight,\" including Arizona Republican John McCain and Democrat Charles Schumer, took a tour of the Arizona-Mexico border on Wednesday. Schumer told reporters after the tour that the lawmakers were 90% done with their work crafting the legislation.\n\nObama called on Congress this week to expedite the process and deliver an immigration bill as soon as possible. The president, who overwhelmingly won the Latino vote in his race against Mitt Romney, has been criticized by some Latinos for failing to reform immigration in his first term and for a record number of deportations being carried out under his watch.\n\nIn the Telemundo interview, Obama dismissed the suggestion that there could be potential political fallout for his party if the push on immigration falls short. \"I'm not concerned about the Democratic Party,\" Obama said. \"I'm concerned about the people whose actual lives are (going to) be impacted by it.\"\n\nHe emphasized the importance of the legislation, stating, \"The most important thing is that we're seeing a strong commitment to finally solve this problem in a way that strengthens our border security, makes sure that there's a pathway to citizenship, an earned one, a tough one, but a pathway so that people can live out their dreams and make sure that they have a better life for themselves and their kids.\"\n\nObama also noted that he is prepared to introduce his own plan if necessary, stating, \"I've got my own legislation I'm prepared to step in, but I don't think that's going to be necessary.\"",
    " Title: Border Patrol Agents Warn of Increased Illegal Crossings as Immigration Reform Negotiations Progress\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Gang of Eight in Washington prepares to announce a deal on immigration reform later this week, with a focus on border security before a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, Border Patrol agents are expressing concerns about the potential impact of reduced agent work hours on border security.\n\nAccording to an anonymous Border Patrol agent speaking to \u2588\u2588\u2588, illegal border crossings have nearly doubled since discussions about amnesty began. \"We've seen the number of illegal aliens double, maybe even triple, since amnesty talk started happening,\" the agent said. \"A lot of these people, although not the majority, are criminals or aggravated felons. This is a direct danger to our communities.\"\n\nData obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 and reported within Customs and Border Protection (CBP) from February 5 through March 1, 2013, shows 504 illegal aliens were spotted in the Tucson/Nogales area, with 189 being caught on CBP intelligence cameras. Of those 504, only 174 were apprehended, and 32 of the 189 on camera were carrying large drug loads for Mexican cartels. Some were armed with AK-47 style weapons.\n\nPhotos obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 from CBP intelligence cameras in Southern Arizona near the border with Mexico have been provided, with sensitive information redacted to protect the security and identity of the camera locations.\n\nLast week, Fox News reported that sections of the border will soon become unpatrolled as hours for on-the-ground agents are cut. \u2588\u2588\u2588 has learned that Border Patrol agents working the border have been fully funded, yet internal political battles within CBP may be causing funds to be funneled to managers rather than those on the ground.\n\n\"Customs and Border Protection has been given enough money to fully staff the border, but has chosen to use the money elsewhere, we believe it is to fund the salaries of Supervisory CBP Officers,\" Vice President of the National Border Patrol Council Shawn Moran tells \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"The money they are diverting was to go to Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime (AUO), which is actually straight pay and is used to pay Border Patrol Agents for anything past eight hours. Being that we have to maintain staffing 24/7, this is a huge part of border security. The criminals and drugs do not stop coming, so we have to make sure we have people out there.\"\n\nMoran also stated that cutting AUO would result in a 30% pay cut for agents and a minimum 20% loss of staffing out in the field. \"It is internal politics within CBP and also with immigration reform. There are still battles between legacy Customs, INS, and Border Patrol managers as to the direction CBP takes and how the funds are being used. Meanwhile, both parties claim no immigration reform until the border is secured, well, this surely will not secure the border.\"\n\nAs sequestration goes into full effect on April 7 and a deal in Washington on immigration reform gets locked in, illegal crossings are expected to worsen. \"We have seen increased crossings and smuggling since word of staffing cuts began circulating,\" Moran says. \"The border is safer but by no means secure.\"\n\nAnother agent expressed similar sentiments, stating that when apprehended, some illegal aliens ask where they can go to find amnesty.\n\nDespite border security being put further at risk through bad policy, the push for immigration reform, well before full border security is ongoing. The AFL-CIO reached a deal with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on a guest worker program last Friday. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the Gang of Eight has reached a deal on immigration reform on CNN's State of the Union over the weekend, but Republican Senator Marco Rubio has said reports of a deal are premature.",

This information was shared by a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe attorneys, including Stephen Ryan, Todd Harrison, and others from the law firm McDermott, Will & Emery LLP, have been representing Mr. Cohen since June 2017. They are currently reviewing over 3.7 million documents seized during an April raid of Mr. Cohen's home, office, and hotel room. This review aims to identify communications that are protected by attorney-client privilege, in accordance with a Friday deadline set by Judge Kimba Wood of the Southern District of New York.\n\nOnce the review is complete, the lawyers from McDermott, Will & Emery LLP are set to cease their representation of Mr. Cohen. At the moment, Mr. Cohen does not have a replacement law firm but is reportedly searching for a federal criminal lawyer in New York. Sources familiar with the matter suggest that Mr. Cohen is looking for a lawyer with close ties to the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.\n\nAs of now, Mr. Cohen has not decided whether he will cooperate with prosecutors in the case. He has not been charged with any crime.\n\nJudge Wood has appointed a special master to oversee the document review and decide whether communications designated as privileged by Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump, or the Trump Organization can be viewed by government investigators.\n\nThe Manhattan U.S. attorney's office is investigating whether Mr. Cohen committed bank fraud, campaign-finance violations, and other potential crimes. A spokeswoman for the office declined to comment. Mr. Cohen has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThis development was first reported by ABC News.",

However, his dismissal from the Russia investigation following the discovery of his text messages was a point of contention.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) questioned Strzok, stating, \"It was not the discovery of your texts, Mr. Strzok. It was the existence of your bias that got you kicked off.\"\n\nIn response, Strzok argued, \"No, Mr. Gowdy, it was not. I do not have bias. My personal opinions in no way\u2014 \"\n\n\"Well then why did you get kicked off?\" Gowdy demanded.\n\n\"Mr. Gowdy, my understanding of why I was kicked off was that based on an understanding of those texts, and the perception that they might create\u2014 \" Strzok said.\n\nGowdy countered, \"Well, hang on a second, Agent Strzok! Hang on a second. Perception\u2014you're saying it was the perception! There are 13 Democrats on the special counsel probe, including one who went to what he hoped was a victory party (for Hillary Clinton)!\"\n\nAt one point, Strzok refused to answer questions, citing a directive by FBI attorneys, leading to a threat of contempt of Congress.\n\nThroughout the hearing, Democrats defended Strzok, with Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) stating, \"If I could give you a Purple Heart, I would.\"\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, expressed outrage, with Rep. Trent Gohmert (R-TX) stating, \"I do not appreciate having an FBI agent with an unprecedented level of animus working on two major investigations during 2016.\"\n\nLisa Page is scheduled to be questioned by members of Congress in a closed-door session, having had the benefit of watching Strzok's testimony on Thursday.",
    " Title: Secretary of State John Kerry Challenges Syrian President Bashar Assad's Denial of Chemical Weapons Use\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a sharp rebuke of Syrian President Bashar Assad's claims that his regime did not use chemical weapons in the Aug. 21 attack, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday urged the United Nations to take a firm stance when it convenes next week. Kerry's remarks came in response to Assad's assertions, as well as those of the Russian government, that the opposition was behind the deadly chemical attack.\n\nDuring a surprise appearance at the daily State Department briefing, Kerry dismissed Assad's claims, stating, \"Sarin was used. Sarin killed.\" He further questioned the plausibility of the opposition's involvement, stating, \"Or whether the opposition secretly went unnoticed into territory they do not control to fire rockets they do not have, containing sarin that they do not possess, to kill their own people.\"\n\nThe U.S. diplomat's comments were made ahead of the U.N. meeting next week in New York, where U.S. diplomats will continue working on a U.N. resolution to enforce a newly struck agreement that would have the Assad regime turn over its chemical weapons to international control.\n\nAssad's denial of his government's involvement in the chemical attack, which prompted the stand-off with the U.S., was reiterated in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 that was aired Wednesday. In the interview, Assad admitted his country has chemical weapons but continued to push the theory that the opposition was behind the strike.\n\nThe Syrian president was confronted with the newly released findings of a United Nations report on the Aug. 21 attack. The report stated that there is conclusive evidence that the chemical attack occurred, but did not assign blame. It did, however, include findings about the type of rocket used, which the U.S. and its allies claim point to Syrian government culpability.\n\nKerry emphasized that nations cannot \"have their own set of facts.\" He stated, \"This fight about Syria's chemical weapons is not a game. Anybody who reads the facts (in the U.N. report) and puts the dots together... understands what those facts mean.\"",
    " Title: Former President Jimmy Carter Offers Diplomatic Assistance to President Trump, Expresses Skepticism over Russian Interference in 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, former President Jimmy Carter, a liberal Democrat, expressed support for President Donald Trump on several issues, including the media's treatment of the current president and his diplomatic efforts in the Middle East.\n\nCarter, who admitted to voting for Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary, criticized the media for their treatment of Trump, stating, \"I think the media have been harder on Trump than any other president certainly that I've known about.\" He further added, \"I think they feel free to claim that Trump is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.\"\n\nThe 39th president also praised Trump's diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, particularly his initiative reaching out to Saudi Arabia. Carter expressed a positive view of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, stating, \"I've seen in the Arab world, including the Palestinian world, the high esteem that they pay to a member of one's own family.\"\n\nIn a surprising turn, Carter was more critical of President Obama during the interview than he was of Trump. He also expressed interest in helping President Trump work on a diplomatic resolution to the conflict with North Korea, citing his past success in negotiating with the country during his presidency. Carter flew into Pyongyang in 1994, striking a deal with Kim Il-sung, the grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jung-un.\n\nCarter offered his diplomatic services to the White House but, as of yet, has not been accepted. \"I told him that I was available if they ever need me,\" he said, referring to H.R. McMaster.\n\nRegarding the ongoing controversy over players kneeling during the national anthem in the NFL, Carter expressed a preference for players to stand for The Star-Spangled Banner. \"I think they ought to find a different way to object, to demonstrate. I would rather see all the players stand during the American anthem,\" he explained.\n\nIn terms of the Russian interference in the 2016 election, Carter expressed skepticism, stating, \"I don't think there's any evidence that what the Russians did changed enough votes, or any votes.\" This stance contrasts with the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community and the findings of the Mueller report.",
    " Title: Obama's Delay of Employer Mandate Highlights Ongoing Changes to Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's decision this week to delay the employer mandate to provide health insurance is the latest adjustment to his health care law, underscoring the ongoing changes to the legislation more than three years after it was signed into law. The courts have rewritten the Medicaid expansion, while Mr. Obama and Congress have repealed a long-term care program and onerous reporting requirements for businesses.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Obama took unilateral action to postpone the employer mandate for a year, with his aides stating they are trying to demonstrate the flexibility all sides have requested as the massive bill moves toward full implementation. The fits and starts have left an ever-shifting platform that could become even more complex by the time the law's most controversial aspect\u2014the individual mandate to have health insurance or pay a fine/tax\u2014goes into effect on Jan. 1.\n\n\"There will certainly be opportunities here for further confusing people,\" said Timothy Jost, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law.\n\nAll sides had predicted the law, officially known as the Affordable Care Act and widely nicknamed \"Obamacare,\" would change over time, and even Mr. Obama and congressional Democrats had said they'd be open to tweaks that might make it work better.\n\nHowever, observers were taken aback by the White House's sudden decision to delay the employer mandate by one year. The provision requires businesses with more than 50 workers to offer insurance to all full-time employees, or else pay a fine of $2,000 per worker.\n\nOpponents of the law said the move exposed its fundamental flaws. \"Implementation of the ACA has not lowered costs or increased access as promised,\" said Sen. Jerry Moran, Kansas Republican. \"Individuals, families, and employers still face increasing health insurance costs, new taxes overseen by what we have recently learned is a politically-biased IRS, burdensome mandates, and massive uncertainty because of this flawed law.\"\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly tried to repeal the law or at least chip away at it, while Democrats say unfounded criticism and a lack of funding have undermined the administration's efforts after years of work.\n\n\"The problem all along has been that while the program was passed with great fanfare a few years ago, most of the policies that will really impact people won't take effect until 2014,\" said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \"Which is a tough way to sell something to the American people, especially when the Republicans are doing everything they can to undermine a bill that is the law of the land.\"\n\nMr. Jost also said \"widespread, vicious opposition to this law\" has been the prime source of turbulence along the path to implementation. \"It's like if you're trying to get your work done, and somebody's slapping you in the face all the time,\" he said.\n\nThe choices Congress made in writing the law have contributed to the complexity of getting it up and running. Congress did not employ a single-payer system that would have given the federal government complete control, and in an attempt to give states some flexibility, it offered them the chance to set up their own health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges. However, more than half of the states decided to let the federal government create one for them, creating a hodgepodge of state-run and federally facilitated marketplaces.\n\nThe Supreme Court added to the complexity last year when it upheld the core of the law but said states should be allowed to opt out of the Medicaid expansion. Some statehouses are still grappling with whether to accept the opt-out. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers have gone back and recaptured some of the money the law would have overpaid as tax credits for those using subsidies to buy insurance on the exchanges.\n\nIn 2011, all sides agreed to repeal a business expense reporting requirement that had been designed so the IRS could make sure employers were paying their full tax burdens.\n\nThis week's decision signaled that more tweaks and changes may be on the way. \"These things have never been that easy,\" said Mr. Jost. \"I just think it's so unfortunate that it's turned out this way.\"",

The announcement comes after a closed-door meeting that appeared to calm tensions in the party.\n\nRep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) reported after the meeting that the House will vote on a $9 billion flood insurance measure on Friday, followed by a vote on a $51 billion aid bill on Jan. 15. As far as King is concerned, he spoke for all members of the New York and New Jersey delegations, stating that the meeting was \"extremely positive.\"\n\nBoehner and House Republican Leader Eric Cantor affirmed the plan in a written statement, saying, \"Getting critical aid to the victims of Hurricane Sandy should be the first priority in the new Congress, and that was reaffirmed today with members of the New York and New Jersey delegations.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, King had lambasted party leaders for the move, calling it a \"disgrace\" and \"immoral.\" He even urged constituents to stop donating to congressional Republicans. However, King's tone softened after the meeting, stating that the postponement was \"in the past.\"\n\nPresident Obama, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also decried the \"failure\" to act, with the governors stating that the tradition of aiding American citizens in need was abandoned in the House.\n\nAt a press conference earlier in the afternoon, Christie placed the blame on House Republicans and Boehner himself. However, Boehner's toughest Republican critics on the Hill were walking things back late Wednesday.\n\nThe House Appropriations Committee produced a bill Tuesday that significantly pared back the Senate version, bringing it down to $27 billion. The initial plan was to put that bill for a vote, and then allow a separate vote on a $33 billion amendment. Now, it appears the House will move forward with a vote on the full $60 billion, in two installments.\n\nA procession of lawmakers took to the House floor Wednesday to urge action on the bill and decry the decision to postpone it. House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer stated, \"We can not and we should not wait. We must not walk away. I urge the speaker of this House to reconsider and act immediately.\" A spokesman for Boehner, Michael Steel, said, \"The speaker is committed to getting this bill passed this month.\"\n\nThe storm was one of the worst ever to hit the Northeast, blamed for at least 120 deaths and damaging or destroying more than 72,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey and over 305,000 housing units in New York, with more than 265,000 businesses affected.",

Pence's remarks came amidst the ongoing tension over North Korea's nuclear weapons program and its recent failed missile launch.\n\nPence emphasized the U.S.'s commitment to working with allies such as Japan, China, and other global powers to apply economic and diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang. He also highlighted the importance of readiness, stating, \"The United States of America will always seek peace but under President Trump, the shield stands guard and the sword stands ready.\"\n\nAddressing a crowd of 2,500 sailors, Pence reiterated that any attack or provocation would be met with a robust American response. He also pledged to uphold the U.S.'s alliance with Pacific Rim nations and protect freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, a region where China has staked claims to disputed territory.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis, currently on a Middle East tour, also criticized North Korea's missile launch, describing it as a \"reckless act of provocation.\" Mattis did not specify the type of missile, but stated it was not of intercontinental range, meaning it could not reach U.S. territory.\n\nThe Trump administration's stance on North Korea appears to be a continuation of the strategy employed by its predecessor, albeit with the added unpredictability of a new president who has shown a willingness to use force. Pence expressed hope that China would use its influence in the region to pressure North Korea to abandon its weapons program, but expressed impatience with North Korea's unwillingness to denuclearize.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called for a peaceful resolution to the Korean Peninsula issue, expressing hope that the U.S. would refrain from unilateral actions and follow the line President Trump advocated during his election campaign. China has also called for a return to negotiations and has expressed concern over U.S. plans to deploy a missile defense system in South Korea, stating that these plans could damage Sino-U.S. relations.\n\nThe situation on the Korean Peninsula remains complex and uncertain, with both the U.S. and North Korea engaging in heated rhetoric. The Trump administration's strategy, while similar to that of the Obama administration, remains to be seen in terms of its effectiveness in resolving the ongoing crisis.",

Cory Booker (D-NJ) expressed his disagreement with Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) proposal to break up major technology companies, stating that such a move would not be appropriate for a president.\n\nBooker, a fellow 2020 presidential candidate, criticized Warren's plan to dismantle companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google, which she has accused of unfair competition and stifling startups. He argued that a president should not single out companies for breakup without due process.\n\n\"I do not think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here,\" Booker said.\n\nComparing Warren's proposal to President Donald Trump's approach, Booker stated, \"It's not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say, \u2018 I'm going to break up you guys.\u2019\"\n\nDespite this disagreement, Booker clarified that he considers Warren a friend. He added, \"I'm telling you right now: We do not need a president that is going to use their own personal beliefs and tell you which companies we should break up.\"\n\nAnother Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), also commented on the dominance of Silicon Valley's major tech titans, stating that Facebook has prioritized its growth over consumer interests, particularly in the area of privacy. When asked if Facebook should be broken up, Harris responded, \"I think we have to seriously take a look at that.\"\n\nThe tech industry remains a significant topic in the ongoing 2020 presidential race, with candidates addressing issues such as antitrust, privacy, and the impact of corporate consolidation on American businesses.",
    " Title: Chaotic Senate Confirmation Hearing for Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh\n\nWASHINGTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - The U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's Supreme Court pick, was marked by disruption and partisan tension on Tuesday, as Democrats protested the withholding of documents related to Kavanaugh's past White House service and numerous protesters were arrested.\n\nMore than seven hours elapsed before Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge, delivered his opening statement. Kavanaugh, nominated by a president who has often criticized the federal judiciary, emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary, stating, \"A judge must be independent, not swayed by public pressure. Our independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic.\"\n\nThe session became chaotic due to repeated interruptions from Democratic senators and numerous protests from demonstrators, mostly women, who voiced concerns about Kavanaugh's potential impact on abortion rights, healthcare access, and gun control.\n\nDemocratic senators, including Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, criticized the withholding of documents by Republicans and the White House, arguing that it hindered their ability to properly vet Kavanaugh. Grassley deemed the Democrats' request to halt the hearing \"out of order\" and accused them of obstruction.\n\nIf confirmed, Kavanaugh, 53, is expected to shift the court's balance further to the right. Senate Democratic leaders have vowed a fierce fight to block his confirmation, and Democrats signaled they would press Kavanaugh on abortion, gun rights, and presidential power during questioning scheduled for Wednesday through Friday.\n\nThe Democrats' demands for documents relating to Kavanaugh's time as staff secretary to Republican former President George W. Bush from 2003 to 2006 have gone unfulfilled. Republicans have released some, but not all, documents concerning Kavanaugh's two prior years as a lawyer in Bush's White House Counsel's Office.\n\nAs the hearing paused for a lunch break, Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in the Parkland, Florida high school mass shooting in February, attempted to speak with Kavanaugh but was rebuffed. Video of the encounter was widely shared on social media.\n\nThe Democratic frustrations that boiled over on Tuesday had been simmering for more than two years. Democrats have accused Senate Republican leaders of stealing a Supreme Court seat by refusing to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama's nominee to the high court, Merrick Garland, in 2016, allowing Trump to fill a Supreme Court vacancy instead.\n\nThe Senate is likely to vote on confirmation by the end of September, with the court's next term beginning in October. The hearing provided Democrats a platform to make their case against Kavanaugh ahead of November's congressional elections in which they are seeking to seize control of Congress from Republicans.",
    " Title: US-Iran Tensions Escalate as Trump and Rouhani Exchange Hostile Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of escalating exchanges, US President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani have traded hostile warnings, as tensions between the two nations continue to rise.\n\nMr. Trump, in a tweet, warned Iran that it would \"suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before\" if it threatened the US. Mr. Rouhani earlier stated that a war with Iran would be \"the mother of all wars.\"\n\nThe escalation comes amid the US's withdrawal from a nuclear deal in May, which had curbed Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. The US is now re-imposing these sanctions, despite objections from the UK, France, China, Russia, and Germany, who all signed the 2015 agreement.\n\nThe US has expressed deep suspicion towards Iranian activity in the Middle East, and maintains close ties with Israel and Saudi Arabia, two of Iran's main adversaries. Mr. Rouhani's comments, made to Iranian diplomats, did leave open the possibility of future good relations with the US.\n\n\"America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars,\" he said, according to Iran's state news agency Irna. In response to Mr. Trump's broadside, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted, \"Color us unimpressed.\"\n\nMr. Trump's aggressive rhetoric mirrors his Twitter barrages against North Korea's Kim Jong-un, whom he once branded a \"madman.\" Despite their verbal hostilities, diplomacy eventually emerged between the two leaders.\n\nOn Monday, a senior commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guards suggested Mr. Trump's statements were part of a broader strategy. \"The remarks Trump makes against Iran are psychological warfare, and he would be mistaken should he seek to take action against Iran,\" Gholamhossein Gheybparvar said, quoted by the Iranian Students News Agency.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a speech to a group of Iranian Americans in California, said he wanted to try to stop countries importing Iranian oil by November as part of continued pressure on Tehran. He also accused the Iranian regime of resembling a mafia more than a government.\n\nThe Trump administration regards Iran as a destabilizing force in the Middle East, arguing that the nuclear deal enabled Iran to pursue a more assertive regional policy. Iran has sent hundreds of troops and thousands of volunteer militiamen to Syria, and has strengthened its military presence there.\n\nGulf states have accused Iran of backing Yemen's Houthi rebels with both money and weapons, though Iran has denied this. Saudi Arabia, a key US ally, is a major adversary of Iran and has repeatedly warned about Iran's intentions.\n\nIn May, Mr. Trump called the nuclear accord, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as it is formally known, a \"horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.\" He alleged that the deal did not restrict Iran's \"destabilizing activities\" in the region enough, and could not detect or prevent any breaking of its terms.\n\nAnalysts also cited the influence of White House Iran hawks including Mr. Pompeo and US National Security Adviser John Bolton, and Mr. Trump's tendency to target major policies of his predecessor, President Obama.\n\nIran insists its nuclear program is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has said Iran is honoring its commitments. The IAEA has said its inspectors were granted access to all locations they needed to visit in 2017, but that they did not seek to enter any military sites, which Iranian officials declared off-limits - a move the US said raised doubts over Tehran's compliance.\n\nIn May, Mr. Pompeo outlined 12 conditions for any \"new deal\" between the US and Iran, including the withdrawal of its forces from Syria and an end to its support for rebels in Yemen. Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, with exports worth billions of dollars each year. It is already feeling economic pressures, and has seen large-scale protests over rising prices and a decline in the value of its currency, the rial.",

Despite the media's portrayal of a potential repeal, the reality is far from it. For a repeal to occur, a veto-proof majority would be required, a situation that is currently unlikely, according to Representative Steve Cohen, D-Tenn.\n\nCohen, in a recent interview, stated, \"I can't see a veto-proof number coming up. I just don't see that happening. But you've got to remember, we just put off the budget, put off the sequester, we didn't cure that problem we put it off. So you've got some real problems coming up in January and in December with budget numbers and the sequester. But the bottom line is that Democrats are going to be vulnerable to Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act regardless.\"\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, while bearing President Obama's name, is a creation of the Democratic Party. If Democrats were to help Republicans in obliterating it, it would be seen as an admission of governing incompetence, according to Cohen.\n\nTwo possible futures for the Affordable Care Act emerge: one in which it limps ahead, and another in which it undergoes a swift reversal of fortune. The nightmare scenario is not the repeal of Obamacare but the potential political, moral, and substantive challenges that could arise if the implementation process remains problematic.\n\nIf fixing Healthcare.gov takes significantly longer than the Obama administration is forecasting, or if enrollments never spike, political, moral, and substantive considerations could change. For instance, if fewer people enroll through the exchanges than see their policies canceled, it would be politically humiliating and raise questions about the fairness of imposing penalties on people for not entering a system they can't access or may not trust.\n\nIn this scenario, Democrats would face intense pressure to vote for a delay of the individual mandate. They might do so to stave off a full-scale rebellion, with the administration likely acting unilaterally, agreeing to provide hardship exemptions en masse, and hoping to hold the votes for a universal delay below a veto-proof threshold, to protect markets in states with functioning exchanges.\n\nA more desirable scenario is one in which the website works well within a few weeks, enrollments shoot upward, quickly overtaking the number of people whose policies have been canceled. In this scenario, aggregates would matter more than anecdotes and hardships, as the media's bias towards anecdote and hardship would have to contend with raw numbers. If total enrollments, including new Medicaid beneficiaries, approach anywhere near the 16 million the Congressional Budget Office initially projected, the tale of the ACA's success would be impossible for the media to ignore.\n\nStarting Dec. 1, opponents of the law will screen-grab and disseminate every website failure they encounter. However, if the law truly is working well \"for the vast majority of users\" as the administration likes to say, it will be reflected in swelling enrollment figures and regular updates on the law's improving progress. This will take the sting out of \"you can keep it\" attacks, and Democrats won't have anything to run from anymore. You can even imagine them repurposing the Upton bill, to put Republicans on the record against stripping new beneficiaries of their health plans.\n\nA volte-face like that would likely stop the repeal campaign dead in its tracks.",
    " Title: Impeachment of President Obama Unlikely Despite Republican Control of Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of Washington, the prospect of impeaching President Barack Obama, a long-held dream of some conservative factions, appears to be a distant reality. Despite the possibility of a Republican-controlled Senate and House in the November congressional elections, the numbers simply do not add up, making it impossible for the GOP to achieve the two-thirds Senate majority needed to convict the President.\n\nAccording to a recent CNN/ORC International Poll, nearly two-thirds of respondents oppose impeaching the President. House Speaker John Boehner and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who may have presidential ambitions in 2016, have also dismissed the possibility, stating that the actions of the President do not meet the high crimes and misdemeanors threshold for impeachment.\n\nRepublican leaders are attempting to manage the expectations of their conservative base, with Boehner stating that there are no plans to impeach the President. Ryan echoed this sentiment, saying that the issue does not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama and Democrats are using the threat of impeachment to rally their supporters and raise funds. The President has criticized Republicans for their focus on lawsuits and impeachment, rather than addressing issues important to the middle class, such as jobs and infrastructure.\n\nThe impeachment issue resonates with Democratic supporters, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raising $7.6 million online since House Republicans authorized Boehner to sue the President over executive actions.\n\nThe impeachment discussion reflects deeper political undercurrents within the Republican Party, particularly among diehard conservatives and more moderate Republicans. Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University, called impeachment a \"farfetched\" maneuver that could cause independent voters leaning Republican to instead vote Democratic in November.\n\nJonathan Chait, a writer who predicted four years ago that House Republicans would vote to impeach Obama before his presidency ended, now doubts that will happen. Missteps by Republicans, including primary defeats of viable candidates by conservative extremists and the government shutdown they forced last year, have convinced the establishment that they cannot indulge the base on all its flights of fancy.\n\nRepublican leaders are now seeking to steer their base away from impeachment, fearing a politically damaging vote. In dismissing an impeachment move, Boehner and Ryan have sought to shift the blame for any discussion about it onto Democrats and the White House.\n\nThe challenge for Boehner and other GOP leaders is to find a middle path between tea party demands to impeach Obama and less extreme options for action, such as the lawsuit. An impeachment effort after the November election would dominate Washington in the final two years of Obama's presidency, posing possible benefits and risks.\n\nThe impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon and his subsequent resignation still rankle many Republicans today, 40 years later. It was an event that made efforts to remove a sitting president part of routine political discussion in America. A GOP-led House voted to impeach President Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction in 1998. The Senate acquitted him on both charges, with none of the minority Democrats voting to convict, and he stayed in office.\n\nToday, any Republican with presidential ambitions wants to avoid making impeachment a reflex response to dissatisfaction with the White House, Schiller noted. \"If you want to be president some day,\" she said, \"the last thing you want is for Congress to be able willy-nilly to impeach you.\"",
    " Title: Edward Snowden's Asylum Status in Russia Remains Unclear as He Remains in Airport Transit Zone\n\nArticle:\n\nEdward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, remains in the transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, despite speculation earlier this week that he might be able to leave the facility. A Russian lawyer, reportedly planning to meet with Snowden at the airport, had sparked rumors that he would bring documents allowing Snowden to formally enter Russia.\n\nHowever, it appears that even with new legal papers, Snowden's asylum request is still under consideration by Russian authorities. A spokeswoman for the Federal Migration Service told the Associated Press they had no information about the status of Snowden's application for asylum.\n\nSnowden had applied for temporary asylum in Russia last week, following his attempts to leave the airport and fly out of the country being thwarted. He has been staying at the airport transit zone since June 23, when he arrived on a flight from Hong Kong.\n\nU.S. prosecutors charged Snowden last month with espionage and theft of government property. On Monday, the U.S. Ambassador in Moscow, Michael McFaul, demanded Russia turn over Snowden, stating via Twitter, \"Mr. Snowden ought to be returned to the United States to face the felony charges against him.\"\n\nRussian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted an unnamed security official on Wednesday as saying that Snowden has been issued documents, allowing him to formally enter Russia. However, this information has not been confirmed, and Anna Zakharenkova, a spokeswoman for the airport, told The Associated Press that Anatoly Kucherena, a Russian lawyer advising Snowden, would meet with him.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin has stated that Snowden can be granted asylum in Russia only if he stops leaking secrets. Granting Snowden asylum would add new tensions to U.S.-Russian relations already strained by criticism of Russia's pressure on opposition groups, Moscow's suspicion of U.S. missile-defense plans, and Russia's resistance to sanctions against the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.",
    " Title: U.S. Calls for Integration of Religious Freedom into Foreign Policy Amidst Middle East Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Middle East and North Africa are currently witnessing a surge in attacks against Christianity, with terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) systematically destroying ancient Christian communities and relics. The Obama Administration is under scrutiny for its lack of action in protecting religious freedom abroad, particularly in Syria and Iraq, where Christians are fleeing their homes in large numbers, creating a refugee crisis of grave consequences for the entire region.\n\nThe United States, Europe, and key allies have been criticized for their inaction against ISIS's efforts to drive out and eradicate religious communities from their historic and sacred homelands. The Obama Administration has been accused of ignoring the devastating cost of religious persecution on targeted communities. As a nation founded on the principles of religious freedom, America can and must do more to combat religious intolerance, a significant factor in the political instability and violence that plagues the region today.\n\nTo counter ISIS's strategy, the Obama Administration could build alliances with popular local and regional leaders who can expose radical ideologies' moral bankruptcy and champion pluralism and tolerance. The Administration should also combat terrorist propaganda about religious minorities and develop programs that promote tolerance and empower minorities to better advocate for their rights and interests. By reaffirming the importance of religious freedom and working closely with communities and their governments, the U.S. can strip away sympathy and support for ISIS and other extremist groups.\n\nA foreign policy committed to religious freedom can advance national security interests, stabilize and consolidate the spread of democracy, help sustain economic growth, and promote the equality of men and women. It can also prevent religiously-motivated terrorism and undermine the conditions that have helped spur the rise of groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, and the Shuddhikaran Movement.\n\nMoreover, higher levels of religious freedom are associated with higher levels of economic productivity and growth, as recent studies by groups such as the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation have found. Sustainable political and economic development is only possible when religious freedom and equal opportunity contribute to a secure environment in which citizens and businesses can operate freely.\n\nLastly, the U.S. must remain committed to religious freedom because of the special distinction religious freedom holds as a fundamental human right\u2014a belief shared by democratic countries across the globe and protected by numerous international treaties and agreements. American support for religious liberty sends a powerful message to threatened communities worldwide: America is your friend. Such support builds enduring goodwill towards our country among those who could be leading their own nations in the years ahead. It also reminds all observers, whether friendly or hostile, that the U.S. remains committed to a world where justice and human dignity are central to legitimate governance.",
    " Title: Kamala Harris Ends 2020 Presidential Bid, Marking Historic Exit from Democratic Race\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) announced on Tuesday that she was ending her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, marking a significant moment in a campaign that once held historic potential.\n\nIn a statement to supporters, Harris, the first woman and first black attorney general and U.S. senator in California's history, cited insufficient funds as the reason for her decision. \"My campaign for president simply doesn't have the financial resources we need to continue,\" she said.\n\nA senior campaign aide confirmed that Harris made the decision on Monday after discussing the path forward with family and other top officials over the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nHarris launched her campaign in front of 20,000 people on a chilly January day in Oakland, California. She was widely viewed as a candidate poised to excite the multiracial coalition of voters that sent Barack Obama to the White House. However, her fundraising remained flat as the field grew, and she was unable to attract the attention being showered on other candidates such as Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIn her note to supporters, Harris lamented the role of money in politics and took a shot at billionaire candidates Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, who are funding their own presidential bids. \"I'm not a billionaire. I can't fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete,\" she said.\n\nHarris suffered from what allies and critics viewed as an inconsistent pitch to voters. Her slogan \"For the people\" referenced her career as a prosecutor, a record that was viewed skeptically by the party's most progressive voters. Through the summer, she focused on pocketbook issues and her \"3 a.m. agenda,\" a message that never seemed to resonate with voters. By the fall, she had returned to her courtroom roots with the refrain that \"justice is on the ballot,\" both a cry for economic and social justice as well as her call that she could \"prosecute the case\" against a \"criminal\" president.\n\nAt times, she was tripped up by confusing policy positions, particularly on health care. After suggesting she would eliminate private insurance in favor of a fully government-run system, Harris eventually rolled out a health care plan that preserves a role for private insurance.\n\nStumbles, often of the campaign's making, continued to dog Harris into the winter, stymieing her ability to capitalize on solid moments. Harris kicked off November with a well-received speech at a massive Iowa dinner, just a day after her campaign announced it would fire staff at its Baltimore headquarters and was moving some people from other early states to Iowa.\n\nHer message was regularly overshadowed by campaign aides and allies sharing grievances with the news media. Several top aides decamped for other campaigns, one leaving a blistering resignation letter.\n\nWith Harris' exit, 15 Democrats remain in the race for the nomination. Several praised her on Tuesday. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a memorable debate stage tussle with Harris this summer, called the senator a \"solid person, loaded with talent.\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders commended Harris for \"running a spirited and issue-oriented campaign.\" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one of two black candidates still in the campaign, called Harris a \"trailblazer.\"\n\nHarris anchored her campaign in the powerful legacy of pioneering African Americans. Her campaign launch on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday included a nod to Shirley Chisholm, the New York congresswoman who sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination 47 years ago earlier. One of her first stops as a candidate was to Howard University, the historically black college that she attended as an undergraduate. She spent much of her early campaign focusing on South Carolina, which hosts the first Southern primary and has a significant African American population.\n\nHowever, Harris struggled to chip away at Biden's deep advantage with black voters who are critical to winning the Democratic nomination. Harris and her aides believe she faced an uphill battle\u2014and unfair expectations for perfection\u2014from the start as a woman of color. Her campaign speech included a line about what Harris called the \"donkey in the room,\" a reference to the thought that Americans wouldn't elect a woman of color. Harris often suggested it was criticism she faced in her other campaigns\u2014all of which she won.\n\nHer departure from the presidential race marks her first defeat as a political candidate.",
    " Title: Obama's Apology and Healthcare.gov Progress: A Political Dilemma Unfolds\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare moment of political vulnerability, President Obama apologized last week to those who were misled by his promise that everyone could keep their existing insurance policies. However, the apology was not the most newsworthy moment of the interview, as the President also provided an update on the progress of the administration's efforts to fix Healthcare.gov.\n\n\"I'm confident that it will be even better by November 30 and that the majority of people are going to be able to get on there,\" Obama said. \"They're going to be able to enroll. They're going to be able to apply. And they're going to get a good deal -- a better deal than they've got right now when it comes to buying health insurance.\"\n\nHowever, the administration's progress report on Thursday painted a different picture. A spokeswoman for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services told reporters on a conference call that as they fix certain pieces of functionality, new issues are being identified. This suggests a process akin to plumbers working a clogged pipe, with each blockage revealing another issue deeper in the system.\n\nThe administration maintains that it is confident Healthcare.gov will be working for the vast majority of users by the end of the month. However, its detailed assessments make this increasingly hard to believe. Insurance industry officials do not share the administration's confidence, and Republicans in Congress are already preparing to capitalize on the situation.\n\nThe political problem is almost as intractable, and in many ways could interfere with key policy imperatives. This week, Republicans will put legislation on the House floor that would require insurance companies to allow people to keep their recently canceled plans for another year. The bill has little policy merit, but it is on the right side of public opinion and is intended to fracture the pro-Obamacare coalition. If it ever clears the Senate, Obama would likely have to veto it.\n\nA working website would limit the political consequences the canceled plans are causing, but it is in many ways a distinct problem. Republicans would continue to use the cancellations as impetus to undermine the law even if Healthcare.gov were functioning as well as Amazon. The administration is looking for an administrative remedy for cancellation letter recipients, but there is no obvious solution that would not require congressional action, and Republicans would block congressional action that addresses the problem without undermining the law.\n\nIn other words, Obama is facing a political nightmare, and we are not even at the point of contemplating the damage Republicans will inflict if the site is not working by the end of the month. Democrats in Congress will then face increasing pressure to agree to a GOP plan to delay the individual mandate penalty for a year. The administration may have the authority it needs to circumvent Congress here, but it would have to be prepared to admit failure first.",
    " Title: Trump's Letter to Pelosi: A Scathing Rebuttal Against Impeachment as an \"Illegal, Partisan Attempted Coup\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a six-page personal letter sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday, President Donald Trump has lashed out against the impeachment process, labeling it an \"illegal, partisan attempted coup.\" The letter, which serves as a historical record, is expected to have little impact on the anticipated Wednesday vote that could make Trump the third U.S. president to be impeached.\n\nThe letter, written in a tone that reflects Trump's grievances with the process and Pelosi's conduct, is a compilation of the president's criticisms. Trump accuses Pelosi of being inauthentic for claiming to pray for him, and he takes issue with her demeanor throughout the impeachment process.\n\nThe president contends that \"more due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials,\" and accuses Pelosi of turning a \"policy disagreement\" into an impeachable offense. He also refers to the impeachment as a \"policy disagreement\" and suggests that Pelosi is trying to undo the results of the 2016 election due to her preferred candidate's loss.\n\nTrump's letter, filled with exclamation points, accuses Pelosi of interfering in America's elections, subverting democracy, and obstructing justice. He also accuses her of causing pain and suffering to the republic for personal, political, and partisan gain.\n\nMinutes after the letter's release, Trump adopted a more subdued tone during a meeting with the President of Guatemala, stating that he takes \"zero\" personal responsibility for the impeachment. Trump maintains that the phone call with the President of Ukraine, which is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, was \"perfect.\" He described the impeachment of a U.S. president over the call as a \"disgrace\" and a \"mark on our country.\"",
    " Title: Trump Threatens to Withhold Federal Funds for California Wildfire Response, Sparking Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a series of tweets on Wednesday, President Donald Trump threatened to cut off federal funds for California wildfire response, stating that the money is being wasted. The tweets read, \"Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., responded to Trump's threat, stating, \"The President's threat insults the memory of scores of Americans who perished in wildfires last year & thousands more who lost their homes. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, another Californian,'must join me to condemn & call on POTUS to reassure millions in CA that our govt will be there for them in their time of need.\"\n\nTrump has previously threatened to order the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to cut off funds for California wildfires, but the administration has not published an order. Critics on Twitter questioned whether Trump could legally withhold FEMA money that has been appropriated.\n\nState officials accused Trump of playing politics with the California wildfires and said he does not understand the issues involved in fighting fires. They questioned whether Trump is going after California because it is a Democratic state.\n\nBrian Rice, president of the California Professional Firefighters, cited the damage in and around Paradise, California, and said the people there \"have only begun to be able to rebuild their lives.... Now, they find themselves being used as pawns in the president\u2019s ill-informed chest-pounding at their expense.\"\n\nRice also stated that Trump is wrong to blame the fires on state forest management. \"While forest health can be a contributing factor in large fires,\" he noted, \"more than 60 percent of these forests are controlled by the federal government, not California.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has criticized Trump over firefighting policy, tweeted after the president's shutdown speech Tuesday that \"Trump's go-to is governing by fear and division.\"\n\nTuesday, the newly inaugurated Newsom proposed $105 million in new spending to prevent, fight, and escape wildfires in the wake of one of the state's worst fire seasons.\n\nTrump has a history of declaring policy decisions only to change or modify them days later, as seen in the slowed-down withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria. The ongoing situation between the White House and California continues to unfold.",
    " Title: Navigating Grocery Shopping in the Time of Coronavirus: A Guide for Safe and Efficient Shopping\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the current pandemic situation, a simple trip to the grocery store can become a daunting task. Here are some recommendations to help you prepare for a safe and efficient shopping experience.\n\n1. Organize Your List: Before heading to the store, take a few extra moments to organize your list by department or aisle. This will help you move quickly through the store and avoid criss-crossing aisles.\n\n2. Shop Alone: If possible, avoid taking children or partners to the store. Limiting the number of people in the store at one time will make it easier to maintain physical distancing.\n\n3. Combine Shopping Trips: If you can, consider combining your shopping trips with others in your community to minimize their travel and your time in the store.\n\n4. Expect Lines: Some stores may have lines outside the entrance due to staff limiting the number of shoppers. Plan your trip accordingly and expect to wait.\n\n5. Wear Earphones: If the idea of making small talk in line makes you uncomfortable, consider wearing earphones.\n\n6. Sanitize Cart and Items: Some stores are sanitizing carts between shoppers, while others are allowing customers to wipe down their own carts. Ask an employee if you're unsure about the store's policy.\n\n7. Maintain Physical Distance: Be patient and avoid getting too close to others. Remember to be forgiving if someone invades your personal space\u2014they may have been distracted by their own grocery list.\n\n8. Expect Out-of-Stock Items: Many stores may be out of common items like eggs, toilet paper, and bread. Be prepared for empty shelves and have alternatives in mind.\n\n9. Communicate with Household Members: If you're shopping for multiple households, ask them about their preferences for alternative items before you go shopping. This can help reduce your shopping time and set expectations for those who stayed home.\n\n10. No Reusable Bags: Some stores may not accept reusable bags due to concerns about the virus. If you typically bag your own groceries, this may not impact you as much. The virus isn't known to survive long on soft items like tote bags, but some stores that usually have baggers have been offering paper or plastic bags only.\n\nBy following these recommendations, you can help ensure a safer and more efficient grocery shopping experience during the coronavirus pandemic.",
    " Title: Timeline of Events Leading to the Death of 8-Year-Old Migrant Felipe Alonzo-Gomez in US Custody\n\nAn 8-year-old migrant, identified as Felipe Alonzo-Gomez, passed away in the custody of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on Christmas Eve. The child's death follows the death of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl in CBP custody just weeks prior.\n\nAccording to a timeline provided by CBP, Felipe was apprehended with his father near the Paso Del Norte port of entry in El Paso, Texas for illegal entry. The apprehension location is approximately 3 miles west of the port.\n\nFelipe and his father were transferred to the Paso Del Norte processing center, where they were provided with food, snacks, juice, and water. Six welfare checks were logged during their detention. They were then transferred to the El Paso Border Patrol Station, where they received showers, food, juice, and water, and 17 welfare checks were logged over the next two days.\n\nThe father and son were subsequently transferred to the Alamogordo Border Patrol Station in Alamogordo, New Mexico due to capacity levels at the El Paso station. Upon arrival, they were provided with personal hygiene products and meals, and several welfare checks were conducted.\n\nA processing agent noticed that Felipe was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes. About 30 minutes later, based on the agents' observations, Felipe was transferred to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center in Alamogordo with possible influenza symptoms. He was accompanied by his father.\n\nAt the hospital, Felipe was diagnosed with a common cold and given Tylenol. He was evaluated for release but was found to have a 103-degree fever and was held for continued observation. Felipe was released from the emergency room with a prescription for Ibuprofen and amoxicillin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic.\n\nFelipe and his father were transported to temporary holding at the Highway 70 checkpoint. While at the checkpoint, Felipe and his father were offered and accepted a hot meal. Agents provided Felipe with a dose of the prescribed medication as ordered by the medical staff, and agents conducted several welfare checks that evening.\n\nHowever, Felipe appeared to be nauseous and vomited. Agents were aware of this and helped clean up the vomit. His father declined further medical assistance as the child had been feeling better. Because no Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) was on duty, out of caution, agents made the decision to return Felipe and his father to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center.\n\nDuring transportation to the hospital, he began to vomit and lost consciousness. Hospital staff were unable to revive Felipe and pronounced him dead. The Guatemalan Consulate was contacted about the child's death. His father is currently detained at the Alamogordo Station pending transfer to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. He has spoken to his spouse in Guatemala and the Guatemalan Consulate.\n\nThe Guatemalan Foreign Ministry issued a statement that it was alerted to a minor's death in the US. Guatemala's Consul General in Phoenix, Oscar Padilla Lam, traveled to Alamogordo to meet with the boy's father to \"hear his version of the facts,\" according to the statement. The Foreign Ministry said it will provide all assistance and consular protection to the boy's father and assume responsibility for the repatriation of the boy's remains.",
    " Title: Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok Testifies: Hillary Clinton Not a Target in Email Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of transcripts released Thursday, former FBI Agent Peter Strzok told Congress that Hillary Clinton was not a target, witness, subject, or suspect during the investigation into her storage and sending of classified emails on her home server. The transcripts were inserted into the Congressional Record by Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) during a floor speech, defying the Justice Department's slow pace in releasing the information for public consumption.\n\nAccording to Strzok, Clinton was not considered a target by the Justice Department, but rather a \"critical player\" in the investigation. He emphasized that she was \"not by any means the only person that we had an investigative interest in.\"\n\nDuring his testimony to the House Judiciary Committee last year, Strzok also admitted to having an affair with FBI lawyer Lisa Page, despite knowing that, as a top counterintelligence officer, such a relationship made him vulnerable to being blackmailed by America's enemies. He also revealed that he knew of one instance where someone was recruited through such means.\n\nThe Strzok transcript is the third set released by Rep. Collins, following those from Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and Page herself. The transcript shows some surprising disconnects between Strzok and Page, particularly in their text messages.\n\nFor instance, in one text, Page told Strzok that he was fated to be investigating Donald Trump to save the country from a \"menace.\" However, in her testimony, Page stated that the menace was Trump himself, while Strzok believed the menace referred to Russia.\n\nStrzok also disputed the meaning of the now-infamous text exchange where Page expressed concern that Trump would become president and he replied, \"No. No he won't. We'll stop it.\" In his June 27, 2018, closed-door appearance with the Judiciary Committee, Strzok clarified that he did not mean he would stop Trump from becoming president. Instead, he said he believed the \"we\" he was referring to was the country at large.\n\nStrzok also defended his texts in March 2016, before Clinton had won the Democratic nomination and before Trump had the GOP nomination, where he said Clinton \"should\" win the White House 100 million to zero. Strzok maintained that his confidence in Clinton did not color his investigative efforts.\n\nThe transcripts provide insight into the ongoing investigation into Clinton's emails and the role of key figures like Strzok and Page during the 2016 election. The release of these transcripts comes as the Justice Department continues to face criticism for its handling of the investigation.",
    " Title: Justice Scalia's Views on the Death Penalty and the McCollum-Brown Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the case of Henry Lee McCollum and Leon Brown, two mentally disabled brothers who were wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death, has sparked a debate on the morality and effectiveness of the death penalty. The case, which has been in the spotlight due to DNA evidence exonerating the two men, has raised questions about the role of judges who support the death penalty, particularly Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, who has been vocal in his support for capital punishment.\n\nThe case against McCollum and Brown, who were 19 and 15 at the time of the murder, was based on coerced confessions. The conviction was later reduced to life in prison, but it was only after a state commission investigated the case that DNA from the crime scene was tested and other evidence implicated another convicted rapist, exonerating these two men.\n\nIn the past, Justice Scalia has cited this case in his decisions on the constitutionality of the death penalty. In the Collins v. Collins case in 1994, Scalia disagreed with Justice Harry Blackmun, who disavowed his former support for capital punishment and declared that he would no longer \"tinker with the machinery of death.\" Scalia, in his characteristic sarcasm, wrote:\n\n\"Justice Blackmun begins his statement by describing with poignancy the death of a convicted murderer by lethal injection. He chooses, as the case in which to make that statement, one of the less brutal of the murders that regularly come before us, the murder of a man ripped by a bullet suddenly and unexpectedly, with no opportunity to prepare himself and his affairs, and left to bleed to death on the floor of a tavern. The death-by-injection which Justice Blackmun describes looks pretty desirable next to that.\"\n\nThe case of McCollum and Brown, with its brutal slaying and 30 years spent in prison, highlights the potential harm of false and coerced confessions and the power of DNA tests to exonerate the innocent. The legal system, it seems, obscured the truth at every level and every step along the way.\n\nJustice Scalia, in his comments, suggests that the methods of punishment should be directly correlated to the luridness of the crime, a concept rejected by the Enlightenment-influenced writers of the Constitution he alleges to take so literally. Death penalty supporters often use cases like this to illustrate that \"the system worked\" and, by implication, always works. However, as the McCollum-Brown case demonstrates, the only reason it worked was because of an outside commission's investigation, which uncovered malfeasance, a coverup, and a corrupt indifference to justice.\n\nJustice Scalia has stated that the Constitution does not forbid the execution of a convicted defendant who has had a full and fair trial but is later able to convince a habeas court that he is \"actually\" innocent. This stance has raised concerns about the potential execution of innocent people and the moral implications of such a mistake or criminal corruption.\n\nIn light of the McCollum-Brown case, the question arises: How can a person who claims that he could not be a judge if he thought his participation in the death penalty was immoral, yet does not believe it matters under the Constitution if the state executes innocent people, be on the Supreme Court of the United States? On what basis can our country lay claim to a superior system of justice and a civilized moral order when such people hold power?",
    " Title: Younger Generations' Growing Affinity for Socialism and Misunderstanding of Capitalism\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll by YouGov/Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation reveals a significant shift in the political leanings of younger generations, with a majority of Millennials and Generation Z expressing a willingness to vote for a socialist candidate. The survey, which polled 2,100 individuals aged 16 and over, found that 70 percent of Millennials and 64 percent of Generation Z are somewhat or extremely likely to vote for a socialist.\n\nThe trend toward socialism appears to be accompanied by a dwindling support for capitalism, with 50 percent of Millennials and 51 percent of Generation Z holding a somewhat or very unfavorable view of capitalism. This shift in political ideology coincides with a seemingly foggy understanding of economic philosophies and recent history.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, Millennials are better educated than earlier generations, with a higher percentage holding college and postgraduate degrees. However, when it comes to an economic education, younger Americans appear to be in the dark. Socialism, as defined by the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, is a \"centrally planned economy in which the government controls all means of production.\"\n\nThe appeal of socialism to young people, as described by Matt Kibbe of the libertarian organization Free the People, is rooted in values and personal experiences rather than empirical facts. Kibbe suggests that socialism, in the narrative of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is associated with community, cooperation, and dignity. However, these values are not historically part of socialist reality, as demonstrated by the failures of socialist systems in countries like Venezuela, Cuba, and North Korea.\n\nDespite their apparent affinity for socialism, Millennials and Generation Z also embrace entrepreneurship and small business, hallmarks of capitalism. However, they do not connect these activities with capitalism and a free market.\n\nThe growing love affair with socialism among younger Americans is further evidenced by their lack of understanding of basic economic philosophies and recent history. A YouGov poll found that almost 20 percent of Millennials thought the Communist Manifesto \"better guarantees freedom and equality for all\" than the Declaration of Independence, compared to just two percent of Baby Boomers and five percent of Gen X.\n\nFurthermore, a YouGov survey last year found that 87 percent of high school students flunked a five-question test of basic knowledge about American history, the worst of any age group. High school students were also least likely to know who is on Mount Rushmore and could not name the rights enumerated in the First Amendment.\n\nA 2018 poll further revealed Millennial ignorance of history about the seminal event of the twentieth century, World War II, with two-thirds of American Millennials unable to identify the Nazi extermination camp of Auschwitz, and 22 percent saying they had not heard of the Holocaust or were not sure whether they had.\n\nThe oldest of the Millennials were small children when the Berlin Wall was knocked down, and they never felt the threat of the Cuban Missile Crisis or experienced nuclear war drills. They have not lived through the rantings of Comrade Khruschev or the slaughter of millions by socialist regimes.\n\nRepresentative Ocasio-Cortez has stated that her generation has never known true prosperity. For a generation who views history only through its own experience, the idea of a college debt bailout may seem like the socialist dream come true. However, according to Kibbe, the misery AOC blames on capitalism is not reality.\n\n\"Those of us that crunch numbers\u2026 by any conceivable measure, we are living in the most prosperous, most opportunistic, most beautiful times in the history of the universe,\" Kibbe said, \"but\u2026 there's a lot of reasons, from [Ocasio-Cortez's] perspective, that things could suck, even though things are the best they've ever been.\"",
    " Title: Former Homeland Security Secretary Criticizes White House for Dismissing July 4 Terror Warning as \"Standard Operating Procedure\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on Fox News Channel's \"Your World with Neil Cavuto,\" former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge criticized the White House for dismissing the government's July 4 weekend terror warning as \"standard operating procedure.\" The comment, made by White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, was deemed inaccurate by Ridge.\n\nRidge, who served as the first Secretary of Homeland Security from 2001 to 2005, stated, \"It's a real threat. I think it's a permanent threat. I think this is a scourge with which we're going to have to deal with... for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nFormer CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell echoed Ridge's sentiments, urging Americans to take the threat seriously. \"I wouldn't be surprised if we're sitting here a week from today talking about an attack over the weekend in the United States. That's how serious this is,\" Morell said on Monday.\n\nThe heightened threat level comes amid a \"confluence of events,\" as House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul termed it on Sunday. The upcoming July 4 holiday, which celebrates America's founding, coincides with ISIS celebrating its one-year anniversary of major territorial wins this week. Additionally, Internet traffic has seen ISIS calling for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, currently underway, to be changed from a month of peace to a month of calamities.\n\nISIS claimed responsibility for three terror attacks on Friday across three continents, which Ridge suggested were likely coordinated. \"This is a global scourge, and, frankly, until the White House, until this president, western allies, and countries in that region, with the exception of Iran, get serious about destroying ISIL, we're going to be living with this threat on a fairly regular basis,\" Ridge said.\n\nThe warning was issued by the FBI, Homeland Security, and National Counterterrorism Center, and unless the United States takes a more aggressive stance against ISIS, the warning \"may ultimately become a standard warning, i.e., we're at risk all the time,\" Ridge cautioned. \"Not to be breathless, but that is the reality of the new world as long as we let ISIL expand its reach beyond Syria and Iraq,\" he warned.",
    " Title: Federal Workers, Contractors File for Unemployment as Shutdown Reaches Record Length\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the nation's capital, federal workers and contractors are turning to unemployment offices as the partial government shutdown enters its record-breaking fourth week. Long-time federal contractor John Woodson, who would typically be receiving a paycheck, filed for unemployment benefits on Thursday morning.\n\n\"We should still be at work right now,\" said Woodson. \"Politicians should handle this\u2014don't put this on the citizens. You're hurting us.\"\n\nEven if Woodson can secure unemployment benefits, which pay up to $425 a week in Washington D.C., he says it won't be enough to support his family. \"I might have to wash some cars, go back detailing or wash some windows\u2014whatever it takes to put some food on the table,\" said Woodson.\n\nFederal workers and contractors are missing paychecks for the first time since the partial government shutdown began on December 22. This situation is causing some of these workers to do what once seemed unthinkable\u2014apply for unemployment.\n\n\"The reason that I chose a public sector job was the stability of the whole thing,\" said Steve, a federal employee who also visited a D.C. unemployment office. He preferred to use a pseudonym due to potential repercussions. Steve left a higher-paying job in the private sector to work for the government. A significant factor in his decision was a shared sense of mission.\n\n\"The real benefit was a job that I felt appreciated at\u2014a job that had stability,\" said Steve. \"And right now, I feel unappreciated and unstable.\"\n\nOfficials in D.C. and Maryland report at least 7,000 unemployment claims have been filed by federal government workers and contractors since the shutdown began. This number is expected to rise significantly if the shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history, continues. In total, approximately 800,000 employees have been affected by the shutdown. An estimated 420,000 are working without pay, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee, while another 380,000 are on furlough.\n\nAt a rally for federal workers and their supporters in Silver Spring, Md., on Wednesday, some federal workers said they had no choice but to consider applying for unemployment benefits.\n\n\"This is the first time in my working life I am going to have to go to my creditors and say 'I don't know how to pay you.' And it's embarrassing,\" said Michelle, a long-time federal employee who preferred to remain anonymous due to potential repercussions.\n\nMichelle fought back tears as she spoke with a group of women about how to apply for unemployment benefits. She never expected to be in this position.\n\n\"I show up to work. I do a good job. I'm doing everything a responsible adult is supposed to do,\" said Michelle. \"All of a sudden, it's all blown up, and I don't know what else to do.\"\n\nAccording to the federal government, the shutdown will cost at least $50 million a day in lost wages and productivity. However, there are hidden costs beyond money, said Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees.\n\n\"Who in the world is going to want to work for the federal government when [workers] are disrespected...when people are not able to fill prescriptions, bouncing checks [and] ruining their credit?\" said Erwin, whose union represents 100,000 federal workers.\n\nThe details surrounding who is\u2014and isn't\u2014eligible for unemployment can get complicated. Federal employees who've been furloughed can apply for unemployment benefits; workers who've been deemed \"essential\" and are working without pay are not eligible for unemployment.\n\nFurthermore, federal employees who do receive unemployment benefits will have to reimburse the government if Congress votes to give employees backpay\u2014which typically happens when the government re-opens. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has issued guidance for furloughed workers on what to do during a shutdown\u2014including how to write to creditors and mortgage companies.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump said he would sign a bill passed by both the House and the Senate to give back pay to federal workers affected by the shutdown.",
    " Title: Historic Prisoner Exchange: American Contractor Alan Gross Returns Home After Five Years in Cuban Prison\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, American contractor Alan Gross has returned to the United States following his release from a Cuban prison after five years of imprisonment. The landmark humanitarian prisoner exchange was announced today by President Obama at the White House, marking a first step towards normalizing relations with the neighboring island nation just 90 miles off the Florida coast.\n\nThe prisoner exchange, the result of over a year of secret back-channel talks at the highest levels of both governments, represents a significant milestone in U.S.-Cuba relations. The U.S. and Cuba are now set to begin talks to restore diplomatic relations, with the U.S. planning to re-establish an embassy in Havana, as announced by the White House.\n\nPresident Obama stated, \"Today, the United States is taking historic steps to chart a new course in our relations with Cuba and to further engage and empower the Cuban people.\" He further added, \"We are separated by 90 miles of water, but brought together through the relationships between the two million Cubans and Americans of Cuban descent that live in the United States, and the 11 million Cubans who share similar hopes for a more positive future for Cuba.\"\n\nThe announcement follows a phone conversation between Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro on Tuesday, a conversation described as a \"summing up\" of the work done over the past year leading up to these changes. The leaders discussed issues of importance in the hemisphere, while acknowledging that they will have differences to address in the future. According to a senior administration official, Obama made clear his intent to maintain U.S. advocacy for human rights in Cuba.\n\nGross was convicted of espionage by a Cuban court in 2011 and sentenced to 15 years for bringing telecommunication devices into Cuba while working as a subcontractor for the United States Agency for International Development. The Cuban government accused him of being party to a U.S.-led plot to overthrow the government through an \"Arab spring.\"\n\nIn a statement released earlier this month to mark the anniversary of Gross' time in jail, Gross' wife Judy said, \"Enough is enough. My husband has paid a terrible price for serving his country and community.\"\n\nIn return for Gross, the United States has agreed to the humanitarian release of three Cuban agents convicted of espionage in a controversial trial that found them guilty of spying on anti-Castro groups in Miami, but not the U.S. government. All three were most recently held in North Carolina at a federal medical facility for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.\n\nThis humanitarian release marks the beginning of a promised new relationship with Cuba. The White House is indicating the beginning of new talks on everything from travel restrictions to eventual lifting of the Cuban embargo, which has been in place since John F. Kennedy was president.\n\nIn an interview last week with Jorge Ramos for Fusion, President Obama stated, \"We've been in conversations about how we can get Alan Gross home for quite some time.\" He further added, \"We continue to be concerned about him. We think that he shouldn't have been held in the first place.\"\n\nStay tuned for real-time updates as this story unfolds.

    " Title: Prosecutor's Assessment Could Influence GOP Senators' Vote on Kavanaugh Confirmation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the sex-crimes prosecutor hired by Republicans to question Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford during Thursday's hearing informed senators that the case would not hold up in a courtroom, according to sources speaking to Fox News. This guidance, provided by Rachel Mitchell, could potentially sway undecided senators ahead of a crucial Senate Judiciary Committee vote scheduled for Friday afternoon.\n\nMitchell, who spoke at an overnight meeting attended by all 51 Republican senators, reportedly told them that she would not charge Kavanaugh and would not even seek a search warrant. Her opinion could prove crucial as senators prepare to cast their votes.\n\nThe Republican Senators, including President Trump, have emphasized that the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh lack first-hand corroboration. However, Ford testified that Kavanaugh and a friend allegedly trapped her in a room during a high school gathering in 1982, and Kavanaugh attempted to force himself on her before she escaped. Ford maintained that she is \"100 percent\" sure it was him, while Kavanaugh adamantly denied the allegations.\n\nWith 48 Republican senators pledging to vote for Kavanaugh at the scheduled full Senate vote on Tuesday, the outstanding Republicans are Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mike Enzi of Wyoming. Enzi is expected to vote in support of Kavanaugh, but has not yet announced his position.\n\nCollins, Murkowski, Flake, and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin could potentially vote as a bloc. The source told Fox News that Collins, Murkowski, and Flake met with Manchin on the sidelines Thursday evening to discuss the nomination. They spoke for approximately 30 minutes.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jeff Flake, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said Thursday night that \"it's a tough one.\" He added, \"If you're making an allegation, you want there to be some corroboration. Where is the burden? It's like impeachment. You don't know.\"\n\nDemocratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana have not yet revealed their voting intentions. Early Friday, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., announced that he would vote \"no.\"\n\nRepublicans hold a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate, and can only afford one defection in their bid to confirm Kavanaugh, assuming they secure no Democratic votes. Other Republican senators, such as Sen. Bob Corker, have come out in support of Kavanaugh late Thursday.\n\nKavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations leveled against him, calling the process a \"national disgrace\" and a \"circus.\" In his opening statement, Kavanaugh emphasized the Constitution's role in the confirmation process, stating, \"But you have replaced advise and consent with search and destroy.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced a full Senate vote for Tuesday. \"I think we're going to go ahead,\" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said. \"I worry about every one of these votes.\"",
    " Title: Facebook's Privacy Agreement with Regulators: A Look at the Company's Data Sharing Practices and Internal Resistance\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook's agreement with regulators, finalized in 2011, stems from the social media giant's early experiments with data sharing. In late 2009, the company altered the privacy settings of its 400 million users, making some of their information accessible to all internet users. This information, including users' locations and religious and political leanings, was then shared with Microsoft and other partners.\n\nThis initiative, dubbed \"instant personalization,\" was promoted as a step towards a more customized internet, where companies would use the information to enhance user experiences on sites like Bing. However, the feature drew criticism from privacy advocates and Facebook users, who felt their information was shared without their consent.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated these practices and, in 2011, cited the privacy changes as a deceptive practice. Caught off guard, Facebook officials ceased mentioning instant personalization in public and entered into a consent agreement.\n\nUnder the decree, Facebook introduced a \"comprehensive privacy program\" designed to review new products and features. Initially overseen by two chief privacy officers, this program was intended to demonstrate Facebook's commitment to privacy. The company also hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess its privacy practices every two years.\n\nHowever, according to four former Facebook employees with direct knowledge of the company's efforts, this privacy program faced internal resistance from the start. Some engineers and executives considered the privacy reviews an impediment to quick innovation and growth. The core team responsible for coordinating the reviews, numbering about a dozen people by 2016, was moved around within Facebook's organization, sending mixed signals about the company's commitment to privacy.\n\nCritically, many of Facebook's special sharing partnerships were not subject to extensive privacy program reviews, according to two of the former employees. Executives believed that because these partnerships were governed by business contracts requiring them to follow Facebook's data policies, they did not require the same level of scrutiny. The privacy team had limited ability to review or suggest changes to some of these data-sharing agreements, which had been negotiated by more senior officials at the company.\n\nFacebook officials contend that members of the privacy team were consulted on the sharing agreements, but the level of review \"depended on the specific partnership and the time it was created.\" This revelation underscores the ongoing challenge of balancing innovation, growth, and privacy in the digital age.",
    " Title: US Senate Confirms Gina Haspel as First Female CIA Director, Despite Controversial Past\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has confirmed Gina Haspel as the first female director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), despite her role in the agency's post-9/11 interrogation program. The confirmation came in a 54-45 vote, following a partisan debate among senators regarding the CIA's use of enhanced interrogation techniques during the Bush era.\n\nGina Haspel, a CIA veteran, once oversaw a covert detention site in Thailand following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Her confirmation as the CIA's director follows the departure of former CIA chief Mike Pompeo, who left to serve as the U.S. Secretary of State.\n\nSenator John McCain, a Republican who was tortured during his more than five years in a Vietnamese prison, had previously announced his opposition to President Donald Trump's nominee. However, six Democrats crossed party lines to vote in her favor on Thursday.\n\nVirginia Senator Mark Warner, one of the Democrats who voted for Haspel, said she had told him the agency should never have resorted to enhanced interrogation techniques. Warner also said Haspel had pledged never to use such methods if the president demanded it.\n\n\"I believe she is someone who can and will stand up to the president, who will speak truth to power if this president orders her to do something illegal or immoral, like a return to torture,\" Warner said in a speech before the vote.\n\nTwo Republicans, Jeff Flake and Rand Paul, voted against Haspel, meaning she would not have been confirmed without support from Democrats.\n\nRepublican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Richard Burr said the confirmation of a woman as CIA head would send an important message. \"Many others who have served, or are currently serving, have cracked the glass ceiling at the agency. Gina is poised to break it,\" he said.\n\n\"It may be impossible to measure the importance of that breakthrough, but I do know that it will send a signal to the current workforce and to the workforce of the future that a lifetime of commitment to the agency can and will be rewarded,\" Burr added.\n\nA 33-year veteran of the agency, Haspel, 61, spent most of her career as an undercover operative. In 2002, she was selected by the agency to run a \"black site\" in Thailand where harsh interrogation techniques were used that a Senate report deemed to be torture. One suspect that was brought there, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, was subjected to sleep deprivation, nudity, extreme temperatures, being held in a small box, and \"walling\" (being slammed repeatedly into a wall).\n\nThree years later, Haspel ordered the destruction of 92 video tapes that documented the interrogation of al-Nashiri and Abu Zubaydah, who were also held at the Thai location. At least 119 men were tortured by the US in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, according to a 2014 Senate report. Human rights groups say Haspel left Thailand to oversee further US torture, but it is unclear what role she played as her exact record has been classified by the CIA.\n\nPresident Trump has previously called for the US to resume waterboarding terrorism suspects.",
    " Title: U.S. Senate Reviews U.S.-Saudi Relations Amid Yemen Crisis, Highlights Iran's Role in Yemen Conflict\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Senate is currently reviewing U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia, focusing on the country's involvement in the Yemen conflict, following the brutal murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in October. However, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, caused by the ongoing conflict between the Saudi-supported government and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, has received less attention.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in Yemen is severe. The conflict, which has reportedly claimed over 57,000 lives, has driven half of Yemen's 28 million people to the brink of famine, and displaced 2.3 million Yemenis from their homes.\n\nThe U.S. has significant interests in ending Yemen's humanitarian crisis and preventing Iran and its Shi'a terrorist proxies, as well as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and ISIS-Yemen, from establishing permanent footholds in the region. Iran is using arms transfers, training, and terrorist proxies to empower the Houthi rebels, terrorize Yemeni civilians, undermine the security of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and challenge U.S. national security interests in the region.\n\nHouthi rebels have used Iranian-supplied advanced arms in the Yemen conflict, indiscriminately launching over 100 ballistic missiles against Saudi cities, unleashing explosive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) against Saudi civilian targets, and deploying explosive boats and anti-ship missiles against commercial ships in the Arabian Gulf.\n\nMoreover, Iran-backed Houthi rebels have detained thousands of Yemenis and reportedly subjected many of them to \"extreme torture,\" including being beaten with batons, hung from chains by their wrists or genitals for weeks at a time, and scorched with acid.\n\nIran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah terrorists have provided training and support that have greatly increased the lethality and combat effectiveness of Houthi rebels, and enhanced their ability to threaten Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, international shipping in the Gulf, and U.S. forces in the region. Even if Iranian weapons are somehow cut off, the Houthi rebels' combat-experience and training will persist for decades.\n\nWhile the U.S. is right to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for Khashoggi's barbaric murder, it is also crucial to acknowledge Iran's central role in perpetuating Yemen's conflict. Failure to do so risks prolonging the conflict and causing more war, oppression, and misery in the region.\n\nWhile the Saudis must answer for Khashoggi's murder, efforts to limit or end U.S. cooperation with the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen risks emboldening Iran and increasing the suffering of the Yemeni people. Engaging with partners and providing support shows that the U.S. takes the struggle against a real security threat seriously, thereby strengthening the argument that only a political solution will end the conflict.\n\nThe Saudis' lack of institutional accountability and lax military culture have contributed to civilian deaths in Yemen. The U.S. must do more to enforce the Saudis' understanding and application of the Laws of Armed Conflict. Targets must be more carefully vetted, and the Saudi military must do all that it can to avoid harming innocents and to allow for food and humanitarian aid to reach suffering civilians.\n\nA political end to Yemen's conflict is necessary as soon as possible, but any negotiation that includes the Houthis in a future government would formalize an Iranian-Yemeni security relationship, harm U.S. long-term security interests, and provide a strong incentive for the Iranian regime to cause other conflicts in the region.\n\nEven if a ceasefire is struck, terrorists from AQAP and ISIS-Yemen may seek to exploit a U.N.-brokered ceasefire between the Houthi rebels and the Saudi-led coalition and use terrorist attacks to advance their own agenda. U.S. forces, along with Yemeni and UAE counterparts, have worked hard for years to degrade extremist networks in Yemen and to keep America safe from terrorist attacks. The U.S. cannot cede ground in the counterterrorism fight.\n\nResolving Yemen's conflict requires not only ending Iranian and Saudi complicity in the country's humanitarian tragedy but also removing Iran's foothold in Yemen and its ability to destabilize the Arabian Peninsula.",
    " Title: Obama's State of the Union Address: Middle-Class Economics and Economic Fairness\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Obama, facing a Congress controlled by a party that has historically been uncooperative, chose to focus on economic fairness, highlighting the disparity between the prosperity of the wealthy and the stagnation of the middle and working classes. He proposed a strategy that involves redistributing wealth from the affluent to those less fortunate, while also implementing measures to boost wages and create jobs.\n\nThe President did not engage in a stark, economist-style debate on inequality, instead opting for the term \"middle-class economics.\" However, his message was clear: the choice lies between an economy that benefits only a select few, or one that fosters rising incomes and opportunities for all who strive.\n\n\"It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come,\" Obama said. \"Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\"\n\nThe President's proposals, such as raising the capital gains tax to 28 percent, a rate that was in effect during the Reagan era, and imposing ordinary income tax rates on dividends, are not radical, but rather a return to tax rates of the past. He also aims to end a provision in the tax code that shields hundreds of billions of dollars in appreciated wealth passed on to heirs, and impose a new fee on big banks.\n\nThese changes would finance a series of tax breaks for middle-income families, including credits for two-earner couples, increased child care and college tuition credits, as well as other programs, such as two years of tuition-free community college for some students. The proposals are designed to be revenue-neutral, with the tax increases covering the costs of the new programs, thereby avoiding the ongoing debates over deficits that have drained both political parties and the American public.\n\nWhile the Republican party has already dismissed the President's ideas, his speech serves as a reminder of the issues of economic fairness that will be central to the 2016 presidential elections and beyond. The Democratic nominee, whether it be Hillary Rodham Clinton or another candidate, cannot ignore these issues. Even Republicans, traditionally reluctant to raise taxes on top-tier earners, may find appeal in the idea of supporting those in the middle class.",

These emails, which are believed to be the earliest descriptions of the events that transpired on the night of the attack, were issued by the State Department as the incident unfolded.\n\nFour Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, lost their lives in the attack. The emails, obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588, provide a chronicle of the attack's progression, offering insights into the chaotic and dangerous situation that unfolded.\n\nAt 4:05 p.m. Eastern time on September 11, an alert from the State Department Operations Center was issued to various government and intelligence agencies, including the White House Situation Room, the office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the FBI. The alert read, \"US Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi Under Attack.\" It continued, \"Approximately 20 armed people fired shots; explosions have been heard as well. Ambassador Stevens, who is currently in Benghazi, and four COM (Chief of Mission/embassy) personnel are in the compound safe haven.\"\n\nLess than an hour later, at 4:54 p.m., another alert was issued: \"The firing... in Benghazi... has stopped... A response team is on site attempting to locate COM (embassy) personnel.\"\n\nThen, at 6:07 p.m., State sent out another alert stating, \"The embassy in Tripoli reported that the Islamic military group 'Ansar al-Sharia Claims Responsibility for Benghazi Attack'... 'on Facebook and Twitter and has called for an attack on Embassy Tripoli.'\"\n\nThe emails are part of what is likely a large number of communications exchanged throughout the night. They are expected to become part of the ongoing political debate over whether the administration attempted to mislead by stating that the assault was an outgrowth of a protest, rather than a planned attack by terrorists.\n\nFourteen hours after the attack, President Obama sat down with Steve Kroft of \"60 Minutes\" for a previously scheduled interview and said he did not believe it was simply due to mob violence. \"You're right that this is not a situation that was -- exactly the same as what happened in Egypt and my suspicion is that there are folks involved in this who were looking to target Americans from the start,\" Mr. Obama said.\n\nThe White House and State Department declined comment on the email alerts. The House Oversight Committee told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the information in the emails will be part of their ongoing investigation into the Benghazi attack.",
    " Title: Obama Promises Bipartisan Approach, Urges Political Reform at Chicago Fundraiser\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to emphasize the need for a more unified political system, former President Barack Obama addressed a political fundraiser in Chicago on Wednesday, pledging to work towards convincing the American people that Democratic ideologies are the right ones. Simultaneously, he sought to foster a bipartisan tone, acknowledging the current state of Washington's political climate and expressing optimism for its potential for improvement.\n\nSpeaking at a reception for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), Obama emphasized the need for a politics that aligns with the American people's decency, hard work, and creativity. He stated, \"We've got everything that we need to succeed, but the one thing that's still missing is a politics that matches up with the decency and the hard work and determination and creativity of the American people. We've got a politics that's stuck right now.\"\n\nThe president expressed his willingness to collaborate with Republicans who view compromise as a positive aspect of politics. He stated, \"I'm willing to work with any Republican who doesn't think compromise is a dirty word.\"\n\nObama's speech focused on several key issues, including gun control, education, U.S. infrastructure, and climate change. He emphasized the potential for energy independence and the impact it could have on geopolitics and the environment.\n\nThe event, held at the Chicago Hilton, was the first of two fundraisers Obama was attending during his one-night visit to his hometown. The audience included members of the Illinois congressional delegation, Democratic power players such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, DCCC Chairman Rep. Steve Israel, and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\n\nFollowing his speech at the Hilton, Obama visited the home of longtime supporters and Democratic activists Paul and Bettylu Saltzman. The pair hosted a dinner for roughly 70 people, with attendees paying either $10,000 per person or $32,400 per couple for the opportunity to dine with the president.\n\nObama highlighted the Saltzmans' significant role in his political career, stating, \"It's true, [Bettylu Saltzman] had treated me like a son in Chicago, introducing me to many people who would eventually become political supporters.\" He expressed his gratitude, saying, \"I love that woman.\"\n\nThis was the third fundraiser Obama has headlined for the DCCC this year, with three more scheduled. The events aim to raise funds for the DCCC's efforts to elect Democrats to the U.S. House of Representatives.",
    " Title: Democrats Unveil Ambitious Agenda as House Majority Looms: Medicare for All, Green New Deal, and More\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the new year approaches, Democrats are gearing up to introduce a series of far-reaching legislative proposals, many of which were previously stalled under Republican leadership. With the party set to take control of the House in January, these measures, including \"Medicare for all\" and a host of other generous welfare programs, could potentially see a floor vote.\n\nRep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) told Fox News that numerous measures have been languishing for years and are expected to come to the floor under Democratic leadership. The GOP's expanded majority in the Senate, however, makes it unlikely these measures would reach President Trump's desk.\n\nThe Democratic Party's agenda, likely to be spearheaded by Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi, was outlined in their \"A Better Deal\" campaign platform. The set of proposals claims nearly every item could be paid for by rolling back the Trump tax cuts. The most liberal bills have emerged from the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nOne of the most contentious proposals is \"Medicare for all,\" which, according to one estimate, could cost nearly $33 trillion over 10 years. The \"Medicare for all\" proposal is just one component of the much broader \"Green New Deal\" platform being pushed by progressives like Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which also calls for a tuition-free and federally funded education system, guaranteed jobs with an emphasis on \"green\" jobs, and more.\n\nIn addition to these high-profile proposals, individual bills sponsored by Democratic lawmakers during the last two years, such as \"college for all,\" \"debt-free college,\" \"child care for all,\" and a \"jobs guarantee,\" could now be voted on along with climate legislation, pro-labor union bills, and attempts to roll back the tax reform bill that passed in late 2017.\n\nRep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), likely the incoming chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, also introduced a \"Worker's Freedom to Negotiate Act\" that bans state laws that allow employees to opt not to join a union and pay union dues. The Democratic campaign plan also calls for spending $40 billion on \"universal high-speed Internet.\"\n\nOther notable proposals include Rep. David Cicilline's (D-R.I.) Child Care for Working Families Act, which ensures that no family under 150 percent of a state's median income pays more than 7 percent of their income for child care, and Rep. Ro Khanna's (D-Calif.) Job Opportunities for All Act, which provides federal funding to put people to work immediately in both the public and the private sector.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who could play a prominent role in such legislative proposals, is a co-chairwoman of the Medicare For All Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She was also the sponsor of the College for All Act in 2017, which would eliminate tuition and fees at public colleges and universities for families earning up to $125,000, and make community college free for everyone. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduced the Senate version, while Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), the other progressive caucus co-chairman, introduced a similar bill, the Debt-Free College Act.\n\nAs the new Congress convenes, Democrats are poised to introduce a wide range of ambitious legislative proposals, many of which could reshape the American social and economic landscape. The success of these measures remains to be seen, but their introduction is certain to spark lively debate and potentially significant changes in the coming years.",
    " Title: White House Faces Challenges as Democratic Unity Cracks over Obamacare Website Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the government shutdown, President Barack Obama's political capital has taken a hit due to the troubled rollout of the Obamacare healthcare website. The once-unified Democratic front, which held strong during the shutdown, has shown signs of cracking as the party grapples with the website's issues.\n\nFor weeks leading up to the shutdown, President Obama managed to keep every Democrat in the House and Senate united. However, the problems with the Obamacare website have transformed the president from a man with a seemingly renewed political capital to one who appears to be on the defensive. The man who was setting the agenda is now trying to beat back the latest frame Republicans have forced on him, inadvertently providing evidence to support the doubts they've been trying to sow from the beginning.\n\nThe White House has been dealing with a bizarre episode involving Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) over a supposed insult from a Republican, while also dealing with the growing impatience and dismay among Democrats over the botched rollout of the website.\n\nPrivately, certain Republicans have expressed concern with the party's decision to focus so much attention on the website, which could be fixed over the next few months, instead of calling attention to other potentially problematic aspects of the law. Polls show support for Republicans remains way down, while support for Obamacare is still ticking up.\n\nHowever, instead of promoting all the aspects of the law that don't involve uninsured people spending hours trying to sign up, Democrats have had to confront undeniable problems that have even core liberals worried. A growing number of people on the Hill are pushing the White House to change its current position that it can fix the problems with the website without changing the deadlines or time frame.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) has been one of the most vocal critics, suggesting a delay in the individual mandate penalty for a year. Manchin, who has always been suspicious of an individual mandate, has yet to hear back from the White House regarding his announcement.\n\nThe good news, from the White House perspective, is that even Manchin\u2014who has been a skeptic of the individual mandate\u2014has only gone as far as suggesting a delay. The White House officials argue that any political fallout will be addressed as they overhaul the site, expressing confidence that most people outside of Washington are past looking at Obamacare as a political issue and want to see it preserved, if repaired.",
    " Title: New York Attorney General Files Lawsuit Against Trump Foundation, Alleging Extensive Illegal Activities\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York Attorney General Barbara Underwood has filed a lawsuit against the Trump Foundation, President Donald Trump, and his three eldest children, alleging extensive and persistent lawbreaking. The lawsuit, filed in the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan, accuses the foundation of unlawful political coordination, repeated self-dealing transactions, and violations of laws governing non-profit organizations.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to dissolve the foundation and $2.8 million in restitution. The president responded on Twitter, calling the lawsuit a politically motivated attack and vowing not to settle the case. The attorney general is also seeking to bar the president and his children from serving on the board of any New York-based charity.\n\nThe investigation into the Trump Foundation began in 2016 under the previous New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, who resigned last month following allegations of physical abuse by several of his former girlfriends. In October 2016, Schneiderman ordered the Trump Foundation to stop fundraising in New York after finding it had no proper registration.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the foundation was used to promote Trump's presidential campaign, with funds raised for the foundation being used to promote the campaign and pay for personal items, including a painting of Trump himself. The Trump Foundation issued a statement denying the charges and accusing the attorney general of holding its remaining funds \"hostage for political gain.\"\n\nThe lawsuit adds to Trump's legal challenges, which include a wide-ranging special counsel investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The investigation has resulted in indictments of several of Trump's associates and a raid on the home and office of Trump's long-time lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen.\n\nThe lawsuit marks a new front in the ongoing criminal investigations into Trump and his empire. While administration officials may attempt to brand the investigation as politically motivated, the New York Attorney General has significant investigatory and prosecutorial power, and if she starts looking into some of Trump's more questionable charitable activities, there's no telling what she might turn up.\n\nThe 41-page document filed with the NY Supreme Court spells out a range of alleged violations of laws concerning non-profit organizations, dating back more than a decade. The investigation apparently found that the foundation was \"little more than an empty shell that functions with no oversight by its board of directors.\" The board had not met since 1999, despite being legally required to meet annually, and did not oversee the foundation's activities \"in any way.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the foundation was used to promote Trump's presidential campaign, with more than $2.8 million being donated to the foundation at a charity fundraiser for veterans in Iowa in January 2016. The petition alleges that those funds raised from the public were used to promote Trump's campaign for the presidency, in particular in the Iowa nominating caucuses.\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that the foundation paid $100,000 to settle legal claims against Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, $158,000 to settle claims against one of his golf clubs, and $10,000 to purchase a painting of Trump to hang at another of his golf clubs. The purchase of the painting was an example of one of \"at least five self-dealing transactions\" which violate tax regulations on non-profit charities, the statement said.\n\n\"As our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality,\" Ms. Underwood said. The investigation is ongoing, and it remains to be seen what further revelations may come to light.",
    " Title: NSA Audit Reveals Thousands of Privacy Violations, Sparking Calls for More Oversight\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a report published by The Washington Post on Thursday, it was revealed that the National Security Agency (NSA) had broken privacy rules thousands of times each year since 2008. The audit, which was first reported by the Washington Post, has sparked heated discussions and criticism in Washington over the NSA's infringement on Americans' privacy.\n\nSenator Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed his concern about the NSA's wrongful impingement on privacy and stated that his committee will hold a hearing on the Post's revelations. Leahy noted that the committee will continue to demand \"honest and forthright answers\" from the intelligence community.\n\nIn a call with reporters on Friday, John DeLong, the NSA's director of compliance, acknowledged that \"mistakes occur,\" even as he insisted that only a \"tiny\" amount of such problems were intentional. DeLong emphasized that \"no one at NSA thinks a mistake is OK.\"\n\nThe May 2012 audit found 2,776 incidents of \"unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications\" in the preceding 12 months, according to the Post's report by reporter Barton Gellman. Most of these incidents involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure, with the most serious incidents including a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders.\n\nCongressional leaders, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, have called for \"rigorous oversight\" by Congress on the \"incidents of non-compliance.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported that most incidents involved unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the country. In one case, a programming error caused a \"large number\" of calls placed from Washington to be intercepted due to a programming error that confused the capitol's 202 area code for 20, the international dialing code for Egypt.\n\nThe NSA released a statement on Friday defending its programs, stating that \"NSA's foreign intelligence collection activities are continually audited and overseen internally and externally.\" The agency also noted that it \"reports the issue internally and to federal overseers -- and aggressively gets to the bottom of it\" when it makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest offered a similar statement, saying the NSA compliance office's review reflects its commitment to abiding by the law and protecting people's privacy. The man who leaked the audit to the Post, Edward Snowden, has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks.\n\nThe NSA's compliance office stated that it \"detects and corrects mistakes\" as they occur and are identified, which stops them from being \"propagated.\" The agency also noted that those who make repeated mistakes lose access to key databases.\n\nOverall, the NSA insisted that it carefully adheres to privacy protections. The audit report has sparked calls for more oversight and hearings in Congress, with lawmakers expressing concern about the NSA's mistakes and the need for more transparency in the agency's operations.",

Lou Barletta Wins Pennsylvania Republican Senate Primary, Advances to Face Democratic Incumbent Bob Casey Jr.\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closely contested race, Republican Representative Lou Barletta has emerged victorious in the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary, defeating state Representative Jim Christiana. The Associated Press called the race for Barletta after 52 percent of precincts had reported their numbers, showing he had 59 percent of the votes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump endorsed Barletta in a February tweet, praising him as \"a Great Republican\" and highlighting his early support for the president. Trump also criticized Democratic incumbent Bob Casey Jr., stating that he listens to \"Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer.\"\n\nIn a tweet on Tuesday, Trump congratulated Barletta on his victory, saying, \"Lou is a friend of mine and a special guy, he will very much help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nIn a similar tweet on Wednesday morning, Trump expressed his confidence in Barletta, stating, \"Congratulations to Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania. He will be a great Senator and will represent his people well \u2013 like they haven\u2019t been represented in many years.\"\n\nBarletta will now face Casey in the November general election for the U.S. Senate seat. The race is expected to be a high-stakes contest, with both candidates already having expressed their positions on various issues during the primary campaign.",
    " Title: Trump's Defiance of Media and Political Criticism: A Look at the President's Unconventional Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, the intensity of criticism often mirrors a political figure's influence. The media, as a primary source of information, has traditionally offered unsolicited advice to the Republican Party. However, this advice has not always yielded favorable results for the GOP. Donald Trump's presidency, however, has been an exception, with his disregard for media counsel contributing to his electoral success.\n\nIn the current political climate, the media is urging Trump to refrain from criticizing Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Contrary to this advice, Trump should intensify his criticisms, highlighting Mueller's potential conflicts of interest and the partisan nature of his investigation. The media's fervor over the possibility of a fired Mueller seems unwarranted. If Trump were to dismiss Mueller, the uproar from the media and the ruling class would subside, and the American people would remain indifferent, as the Russian probe has become background noise. Trump's re-election would be ensured, and the only casualties would be the timid Republicans who align with the Democrats in calling for Trump's impeachment.\n\nBeneath the surface of the media's guidance lies a questionable principle: a duly elected president is not permitted to manage his own executive branch. This principle, if applied consistently, would imply that Trump is not allowed to run his own Justice Department. Trump should counter this argument by asserting his right to govern according to the will of the American people, who elected him, and not according to the preferences of the D.C. ruling class, which includes Mueller, a close associate of former FBI Director James Comey, who is often seen as a symbol of this class.\n\nRecently, former CIA Director John Brennan, who supported the Soviets during the Cold War and the Muslim Brotherhood in the present era, has resurfaced, calling for government officials to defy orders to fire Mueller. The media, which has long normalized left-wing radicalism, has portrayed Brennan's comments as evidence of high patriotism and statesmanlike wisdom. In reality, Brennan's remarks are akin to a call for a coup against a duly elected U.S. president.\n\nThe media's hostility towards the American people, as revealed by former New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis' admission that the country needs a \"new people,\" has not abated. Those who voted Trump into office should not be concerned by the volume of criticism from these perpetual complainers and malcontents, who are determined to impose their willful liberalism on every aspect of the country. Instead, they should be alarmed if the criticism ceases.",
    " Title: Obama Warns Syria on Chemical Weapons as Activity at Stockpile Sites Increases\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, President Barack Obama has issued a stern warning to the Syrian government over the movement of chemical weapons, stating that any use or threatening behavior could prompt direct American intervention. This statement was made during a news conference in August.\n\nThe activity at the chemical weapons sites has raised concerns, but American officials are yet to confirm whether this activity crosses the \"red line\" set by Mr. Obama. A senior American diplomat, deeply involved in the effort to dissuade Syrian forces from using chemical weapons, suggested that the activity could be a sign of desperation rather than a direct threat.\n\nIsraeli officials, too, have expressed caution, suggesting that the movement of chemical weapons and the apparent preparations to use them could be a bluff or a warning to the West. However, a senior Israeli official noted unusual activity that they have not seen before.\n\nThe White House has remained silent on the intelligence reports, but a senior administration official issued a warning to the Syrians, reiterating that the use of chemical weapons would cross a red line for the United States. The official also emphasized that the international community would hold the Syrian regime accountable if they use chemical weapons or fail to secure them.\n\nRepresentative Mike Rogers, the head of the House Intelligence Committee, declined to comment on the new intelligence reports but expressed concern about the potential collapse of the Assad regime and the dangerous vacuum it could create. He also warned that the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime would demand decisive action from the international community.\n\nIn response to the crisis, the United States military has sent a task force of over 150 planners and specialists to Jordan to help the armed forces prepare for the possibility of Syria losing control of its chemical weapons. Turkey has also requested two batteries of the Patriot antimissile system from NATO, citing the potential use of chemical weapons in warheads.\n\nThis is not the first time activity at stockpile sites has been detected. In September, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta reported some movement of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles to more secure locations. However, the new activity appears to be of a different nature, and officials are no longer willing to confirm that all the sites remain secure.\n\nThe United States and its allies have increased electronic eavesdropping and other surveillance activities of the sites. A senior defense official confirmed that no U.S. troops have been put on heightened alert in response to the activity, although the Pentagon is prepared to do so if necessary.",
    " Title: George Conway Discusses Trump Administration, Marriage, and Political Shifts in Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an extensive interview with Yahoo News' podcast Skullduggery, George Conway, the husband of Kellyanne Conway, one of President Trump's closest advisers, shared his views on the Trump administration, their differing political views, and his withdrawal from a potential role in the Justice Department.\n\nConway, who has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration, discussed his consideration for the position of chief of the civil division, which would have involved defending the administration in lawsuits. He revealed that he withdrew from the role due to his disapproval of the administration's actions.\n\nConway also spoke about the impact of his public criticisms on his marriage, stating, \"I don\u2019t think she likes it,\" referring to his wife and his constant criticisms of the Trump administration. However, he added, \"I\u2019ve told her, I don\u2019t like the administration, so it\u2019s even.\"\n\nComparing their political disagreements to those common in Washington, D.C., Conway said, \"If I had a nickel for everybody in Washington who disagrees with their spouse on something that happens in this town, I wouldn\u2019t be on this podcast. I\u2019d be probably on a beach somewhere.\"\n\nConway criticized the administration, citing events such as the firing of James Comey and the president's comments about Russia as reasons for his disapproval. He also expressed concern about the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel, fearing a potential war between the Justice Department and the administration.\n\nDespite his criticisms, Conway acknowledged his wife's significant role in Trump's election and praised her work. He stated, \"She basically got this guy elected. She steadied that boat.\" However, he also noted that Trump's presidency has significantly changed the country and the Republican party, which he described as a \"personality cult.\"\n\nConway revealed that he had switched parties due to his discomfort with the current state of the Republican party and stated that he would rather move to Australia than vote for Trump again.",
    " Title: Israel Warns of Iran's Nuclear Program and Holocaust Parallels as Peace Talks with Palestinians Stall\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions between Israel and the Palestinians have reached a new high as peace talks have once again stalled, with President Mahmoud Abbas' ongoing connection to the terror group Hamas raising concerns that he does not recognize Israel's right to exist. Simultaneously, as President Obama's foreign policy continues to face criticism, Israel is expressing new concerns and warnings about Iran's nuclear program.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stern warning during the country's annual memorial day for the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, likening Iran's suspected nuclear ambitions to the Nazi genocide. Speaking at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, Netanyahu drew parallels between the Nazi genocide and Iran's leaders' repeated references to the destruction of Israel and their denial of the Holocaust.\n\nNetanyahu questioned why, in the years leading up to the Holocaust, most of the world's leaders did not see the danger ahead of time. \"In hindsight, all the signs were there,\" he said.\n\nThe Obama administration's approach to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons has been criticized for being insufficient, and Secretary of State John Kerry has been accused of painting Israel as the villain in the peace talks. In a closed-door meeting last week, Kerry reportedly warned that if Israel does not make peace soon, it could become \"an apartheid state,\" a comparison that has sparked outrage among Jewish leaders in America and Israel.\n\nThe use of the term \"apartheid\" is rare among American officials, and President Obama has previously rejected the idea that it should apply to Israel. Kerry's use of the loaded term has already caused controversy and could attract unwanted attention in Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has threatened to pull out of sanction agreements on Iran, adding to Israel's concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The Obama administration's foreign policy has been criticized for isolating allies and promoting enemies, raising questions about the future of U.S.-Israel relations and the stability of the Middle East.",
    " Title: U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm Faces Criminal Charges, Attorney Maintains Innocence\n\nA statement from the attorney representing U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm (R-NY) on Friday confirmed that federal prosecutors have disclosed their intent to file criminal charges against the congressman. The charges stem from an ongoing investigation into possible campaign finance violations.\n\nGrimm's attorney, William McGinley, stated in the release that the two-year investigation, which has been marked by leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, will ultimately result in Grimm's vindication.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn and the FBI's New York office declined to comment on the case. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office said he couldn't confirm, deny, or comment on the case.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee announced in November that Grimm was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations. The panel deferred its inquiry due to a separate Department of Justice investigation.\n\nGrimm made headlines in January after confronting a New York City cable news station reporter who tried to question him about a long-running FBI investigation into campaign finance. Grimm was recorded saying he would throw the reporter off a balcony if the reporter asked him about the investigation again.\n\nDuring Grimm's first campaign, he acknowledged receiving contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto. Some members of Pinto's congregation subsequently said they made tens of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions, including gifts passed through straw donors. Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, and the FBI hasn't accused him of any wrongdoing.\n\nIn August, Ofer Biton, the Israeli businessman who had served as Grimm's liaison to Pinto's followers, pleaded guilty to an immigration fraud charge. Three days later, the FBI filed a sealed criminal complaint accusing a Houston woman named Diana Durand, who had been romantically involved with Grimm, of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions.\n\nOn Friday, Durand was indicted in Brooklyn on those charges. She was also charged with making false statements to the FBI when she said she didn't reimburse straw donors for their contributions to Grimm's campaign. Attorney Stuart Kaplan said Durand would plead not guilty to the charges.\n\nA spokesman in Grimm's Washington office did not immediately return emails or a telephone message seeking comment.\n\nUnder federal law and the chamber's rules, an indicted House member does not lose any rights or privileges. However, rules used by the two major political parties require indicted committee or subcommittee chairmen, or members of a party's leadership, to temporarily step aside. Grimm is not a chairman or a member of the leadership.\n\nAssociated Press writers Tom Hays, Michael Sisak, and Alan Fram contributed to this report from New York and Washington, D.C.",
    " Title: \"2016 Presidential Election: Sanders Leads in Ad Spending, but Trump Outperforms in Ad Efficiency\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 Presidential Election is shaping up to be the most expensive in history, with a significant increase in the number of TV ads aired compared to the 2012 election. According to a new report from the Wesleyan Media Project, 480,000 ads have aired thus far in the 2016 election cycle, a 112 percent increase over the same period in 2012.\n\nIn the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders has spent more on TV ads than any other candidate, totaling nearly 125,000 ads as of May 8. Sanders, who has relied heavily on small donors, has spent approximately $8 per vote, while Hillary Clinton has spent about $5 per vote, despite spending about $11 million less on ads.\n\nOn the Republican side, the race has been marked by a high number of candidates, many of whom have dropped out after only a few votes were cast. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who had a superPAC behind him and dropped out before any contests took place, spent approximately $17,000 per vote. Excluding Jindal's astronomical figure, the candidates spent significantly less per vote, with Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Lindsey Graham, and John Kasich all spending millions but amassing few votes.\n\nDonald Trump, who has spent about $2 on TV ads per vote, stands out as the most efficient spender of ads. Trump, who was already a household name in the U.S., has been able to secure significant free media coverage, estimated at $2 billion as of March. This estimated $2 billion may be a key factor in Trump's ability to maintain high levels of support despite anti-Trump ads spending nearly $6 million more than the candidate himself.\n\nThe Wesleyan Media Project's data suggests that the superPAC has changed the campaign fundraising game, but money does not necessarily buy votes. The effectiveness of ads may be waning as Americans spend more time online and cut the cord on traditional television. Gregg Phillips, who ran Newt Gingrich's 2012 superPAC, Winning Our Future, told NPR last year that \"more and more people are sort of turning off those [TV] ads.\" Phillips suggested that younger generations are more likely to be moved by online ads or grassroots campaigns.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2016 Presidential Election is on track to be the most expensive in history, with significant differences in ad spending and efficiency between candidates. Bernie Sanders has spent the most on ads, but Donald Trump has spent his ads most effectively, with approximately $2 per vote. The superPAC has changed the campaign fundraising game, but the effectiveness of ads may be waning as Americans spend more time online.",
    " Title: Pentagon Clarifies Number of Troops Diagnosed with Brain Injuries Following Iran Strike, Provides Update on Their Status\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent update, the Pentagon has clarified the number of troops who were diagnosed with brain injuries following the U.S. strike on an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq. According to the latest information, 11 troops were pulled out of Iraq for brain injury treatment.\n\nOn Friday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper provided an update on the status of these troops. He stated that out of the 34 troops diagnosed with brain injuries, 17 have returned to duty, including one service member who was transferred to Kuwait for treatment.\n\nEsper also revealed that eight service members have been transferred to the U.S. for treatment after initially being sent to Germany. Nine are still undergoing treatment and evaluation in Germany.\n\nEsper attributed the change in numbers to symptoms that \"are late-developing\" and \"manifest over a period of time.\" He explained that while some troops initially screened for concussion-like symptoms saw their conditions improve rapidly, others did not. Some of these troops had their conditions worsen, and some had severe enough symptoms that they were transported for further treatment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had previously played down the initial reports of injuries, stating on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that the injuries were not \"very serious.\" However, Esper, during his speech on Friday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, defended the Pentagon's reporting of injuries around the globe, emphasizing the importance of accuracy and proper categorization of such incidents.\n\nEsper also clarified that the Pentagon does not normally report such injuries, stating that \"This is mostly outpatient stuff. So we can track that if\u2014if you're really interested in it.\" He also noted that he did not know the exact number of injured troops at the time of his previous comments. \"I'm not a doctor and I'm not the ones evaluating them,\" he said.\n\nThe Pentagon's commitment to transparency and accurate reporting of such incidents, as stated by Esper, extends to troops engaged in operations worldwide.",
    " Title: Facebook's Trending Topics Allegations: A Call for Informed Consumer Choice in the Digital Age\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the digital age, technology has democratized information, making it easier for individuals to access and share news from various sources. However, the human impulse for control and power remains prevalent, as evidenced by recent allegations against Facebook's Trending Topics feature. A Gizmodo investigation has revealed that the social media giant may have suppressed conservative news and opinion sites from its Trending Topics index.\n\nFacebook's Trending Topics function provides users with a headline feed that indicates the top stories generating discussion on the platform. The site claims that the feed results from organic conversations among users, offering a measure of social penetration of issues, activists, and news sites. However, some former Facebook curators have admitted that they excluded results from conservative news and opinion sites, including The Drudge Report, Breitbart News, The Washington Examiner, and RedState (a site owned by Townhall Media Group, which also owns Hot Air, where the author is employed as senior editor).\n\nThe suppressed topics ranged from conservative political events such as the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) to discussions about Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) and Mitt Romney. Some curators reportedly received instructions to \"inject\" topics into the index to artificially produce discussion, with some injections appearing to promote certain agendas, such as the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nFacebook has denied these allegations, stating that it does not allow or advise its reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin. However, the Gizmodo investigation has raised questions about the transparency and objectivity of Facebook's Trending Topics feature.\n\nIn light of these allegations, conservatives are grappling with what to do next. Some have suggested abandoning Facebook altogether, arguing that it is not worth engaging with a platform that may suppress conservative viewpoints. However, others argue that pulling out would only make conservatism more insular and would play into the hands of liberal Facebook curators who may want to banish conservatives from the platform or make them as irrelevant as possible.\n\nInstead, conservatives should use the open platform of Facebook and other social media networks to engage people, make connections, and use those networks to expand the reach and relevance of the conservative agenda. However, they should also treat Facebook more skeptically than they once did, exercising their own choices and calling out those gatekeepers when their biases become so obvious as to be insulting.\n\nInformed consumer choice is not just an antidote to editorial bias; it is a freedom worth liking on any and all social networks. As consumers, we must remain vigilant and critical, ensuring that we are accessing a diverse range of perspectives and making informed decisions about the news we consume. In this way, we can ensure that technology truly democratizes information and empowers us all.",

Carney stated that these conversations did not involve the president, who was not informed of the forthcoming inspector general report on the issue.\n\nCarney named only two senior White House staffers who were aware of the IRS probe: White House counsel Kathy Ruemmler, who made the decision not to inform the president, and himself, who learned about it from news reports. He clarified that he had not been among the senior staff informed of the IRS actions earlier.\n\nIn response to questions about who else knew of the report's existence before the first news stories about it emerged on May 10, Carney was evasive, stating that Ruemmler may have had conversations about the matter but could not confirm the existence of an email regarding the issue.\n\nThe briefing grew testy when Carney was asked whether he was among the senior staff who were told of the IRS investigation before news reports emerged. He was not, he said, echoing his response from the previous day.\n\nThe White House continues to defend its decision not to loop in President Obama about the inspector general's report before the news became public.

    " Title: The Impact of Obamacare's Medicaid Payment Reduction on Primary Care Doctors in 2015\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the clock ticks down to January 1, 2015, thousands of primary care doctors who treat Medicaid patients are bracing for a significant pay cut of 42 percent. The Affordable Care Act temporarily boosted payment rates for these doctors in 2013 and 2014 to encourage their participation in Medicaid as the program expanded to cover millions more Americans.\n\nThe temporary pay raise, which averaged out to a 73 percent increase for primary care doctors across the country, is set to expire on December 31. This means that, beginning January 1, 2015, Medicaid doctors will earn less each time they see a patient, or they could decide to pull out of the program altogether.\n\nHere's a quick guide to why the raise happened, why it's running out, and what it means for the future of Obamacare:\n\n1. Obamacare raised Medicaid's primary care payments in 2013 and 2014\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, Medicare (the federal insurance program that covers the elderly) paid doctors more than Medicaid (the state-federal insurance program that covers the poor). On average, Medicaid paid doctors about two-thirds of what Medicare paid, although there was lots of variation across the country.\n\nEven though Medicaid paid less, it has usually done a pretty good job making sure patients can get in to see primary care doctors. However, there was a worry that, after Obamacare, that might not be the case. Medicaid is one of the two big programs the law relies on to expand health insurance coverage (the other is the marketplaces). Forecasters had estimated that 13 million additional people would join the program in Obamacare's first decade, and 7 million of those people would sign up in the first year.\n\nResearch has found that doctors are more likely to accept new Medicaid patients when their payment rates are higher. And the Affordable Care Act included a provision that aimed to entice doctors to sticking with\u2014or perhaps joining\u2014the program as it expanded to cover millions more Americans.\n\nBeginning in 2013, the law bumped Medicaid primary care doctors' reimbursement rates up to match those of Medicare (specialists did not get any increase). The law funded the increased payments through the end of 2014, setting up a looming cliff that we're now approaching.\n\n2. Doctors will see a 42 percent pay cut in 2015\n\nThat's an estimate from the Urban Institute, which ran the numbers on how payment rates will change in 2015. The decline will vary a lot from state to state. That's because each state sets its own payment rates for primary care doctors. In a state like California, for example, which tended to pay Medicaid doctors very low rates, Obamacare has doubled their fees. But in North Carolina, where the two programs' fees were more similar, the pay rate increase was much smaller.\n\n3. The federal government will not extend the pay cut\n\nMostly because it's expensive: the two years of the pay-bump cost the federal government $11 billion.\n\nMedicaid advocacy groups have lobbied Congress a bit to extend the pay cut for at least two years now. And Sens. Patty Murray (D-WA) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) did introduce legislation that would extend the pay bump until 2016.\n\n\"We\u2019re ready to lobby for what\u2019s right to improve the situation,\" Roland Goertz, chair of the Academy of Family Physicians, had said in 2012 about extending the pay cut. \"We\u2019re ready to go to the mat for what works, and we need to be going in this direction.\"\n\nBut the issue has not gotten traction; the Murray-Brown bill has languished in committee since its introduction this past summer. And that means, barring any last-minute miracle, Medicaid payment rates will decline in many states\u2014but not all\u2014on Thursday.\n\n4. Fifteen states are stepping in to extend the payment raise\n\nMedicaid is a joint federal-state program, with the two governments splitting the bill for patients' coverage. And, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 15 states will step in and provide funding to either fully or partially continue the payment increase.\n\nWhat's notable about this map, however, is that the states stepping in tend to be those that were already paying Medicaid doctors pretty well in the first place. They are places like New Mexico that, before Obamacare, paid primary doctors 85 percent of the Medicare rate, or Mississippi, which paid 90 percent.\n\nThe states that have a much bigger gap between Medicaid and Medicare payments, like California, are not generally not stepping in to avert the payment cut. This is probably due to the fact that fixing the bigger gaps is so much more expensive.\n\n5. Nobody knows what this will mean for Medicaid patients' access to care\n\nThe worry among Medicaid advocates is that lower payment rates will translate into fewer doctors being willing to see patients. This is articulated in a recent New York Times article, citing data from Ohio:\n\nA survey by the Ohio State Medical Association found that some Ohio doctors began accepting Medicaid patients because of the rate increase in 2013. Ohio doctors who were already participating in the program said they had accepted more Medicaid patients after the rate increase. And almost 40 percent of Ohio doctors indicated that they planned to accept fewer Medicaid patients when the extra payments lapsed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that states that pay more for primary care in Medicaid do have more doctors accepting new patients. This chart from Health Affairs shows the correlation:\n\nThose are the reasons for concern\u2014but there are also reasons to think things might go okay, too. Medicaid patients tend to have just as good access to primary care as patients in private coverage. One 2012 study commissioned by the federal government found that Medicaid patients are equally as likely to have had a routine check-up in the past year as those with private insurance. The real challenges in access tend to happen when patients seek specialty care.\n\nAnd it's worth keeping in mind that there were thousands of doctors who saw Medicaid patients prior to the Affordable Care Act's pay bump. These are people who, even before they got a big raise, thought it made sense to see these patients at lower rates. That gives decent reason to think that these doctors will stick around after the pay increase disappears, too.",
    " Title: Homeland Security Secretary Kelly Outlines Immigration Enforcement Changes in Line with Trump's Executive Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nHomeland Security Secretary John Kelly, on Tuesday, unveiled a series of immigration enforcement changes in accordance with President Trump's executive actions, aiming to strengthen border security and expand the categories of illegal immigrants targeted for deportation.\n\nIn two memos released by the department, Kelly outlined measures to hire thousands more officers, end \"catch-and-release\" policies, and initiate work on the U.S.-Mexico border wall as promised by the President. The changes prioritize criminal illegal immigrants and others convicted or charged with any criminal offense, or who have abused public welfare programs.\n\nThe directives will not affect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, also known as \"dreamers,\" as a DHS official emphasized during a conference call with reporters. However, the memos aim to broaden enforcement by no longer exempting classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\n\nThe memos also call for expanding the 287(g) program, which allows participating local officers to act as immigration agents, and had been rolled back under the Obama administration. Furthermore, they initiate the planning, design, and construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall, aiming to end \"catch-and-release\" policies under which illegal immigrants subject to deportation potentially are allowed to \"abscond\" and fail to appear at removal hearings.\n\nThe timelines for these objectives and the budgetary and other constraints the department and its agencies will face remain unclear. In an effort to address the potential increase in cases due to the end of \"catch-and-release,\" a plan with the Justice Department is being developed to \"surge\" immigration judges and asylum officers.\n\nWhile congressional Republicans have pledged to work with Trump to fund the front-end costs associated with the border wall, the memos also hint at future efforts to potentially use money otherwise meant for Mexico, following Trump's repeated campaign vow to make Mexico pay for the wall. The memos, however, do not specify how that information might be used.\n\nMexican officials have consistently stated they will not pay for a border barrier. DHS has identified initial locations to build a wall where current fencing is not effective, near El Paso, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; and El Centro, California.\n\nThe DHS directives come as the Trump White House continues to work on rewriting its controversial executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program as well as travel from seven mostly Muslim countries. The order was put on hold by a federal court, and Trump's team is said to be working on a new measure.\n\nThe directives also come as the Trump administration faces criticism from Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocacy groups for recent ICE raids of illegal immigrants. DHS officials on Tuesday's conference call stressed that they are operating under existing law and reiterated that National Guard troops will not be utilized to round up illegal immigrants, contradicting an apparently erroneous news report from last week.\n\n\"We're going to treat everyone humanely and with dignity, but we are going to execute the laws of the United States,\" a DHS official said on the conference call.",
    " Title: FEMA Terminates Contract with Tribute Contracting LLC Over Underdelivery of Hurricane Maria Meals in Puerto Rico\n\nA New York Times investigation has revealed that Tiffany Brown, an Atlanta entrepreneur and self-described government contractor who owns Tribute Contracting LLC, drastically underdelivered on a $156 million contract awarded by FEMA to provide 30 million self-heating meals to Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.\n\nAccording to the Times, Brown, the sole employee of her company, only followed through on 50,000 meals, despite being awarded the contract on Oct. 3. In response to Brown's failure to meet a deadline of providing the first 18.5 million meals, her contract was terminated by email on Oct. 19.\n\nBrown hired an 11-person wedding catering company and a Texas nonprofit that had shipped food to a Houston food bank during Hurricane Harvey to provide the meals. However, the operation was reportedly a \"logistical nightmare,\" according to an email from Carolyn Ward, a FEMA official who handled the contract with Brown's company.\n\nA FEMA spokesman told the Times that other suppliers provided \"ample\" food and water for Puerto Ricans, and that Tribute's contract did not result in any missed meals. This is at least the sixth government contract awarded to Tribute that has been canceled, according to the Times.\n\nAt the time the FEMA contract was awarded, the Government Publishing Office had a ban on awarding contracts of more than $35,000 to Tribute until January 2019 due to a mishandled project. Brown is now fighting the FEMA contract termination and seeking a $70 million settlement.\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is investigating the Tribute contract. Committee Democrats criticized FEMA in a letter to committee chairman Trey Gowdy, stating that FEMA should have considered Tribute's history and lack of large-scale disaster relief experience before awarding the contract.\n\nIn the letter, Democrats highlighted the Tribute contract as the latest example of how FEMA was unprepared to handle the hurricane aftermath in Puerto Rico by not preparing contractors in advance. They also compared the Trump administration's response to the hurricanes in Puerto Rico in 2017 to the Bush Administration's response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nFEMA and the Puerto Rican government reached an agreement earlier this month to continue providing food and water to affected communities, after the agency faced major backlash following a report that it would stop the distribution.",
    " Title: FBI Indictments Confirm Russian Meddling in 2016 U.S. Elections, but No Evidence of Outcome Alteration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the national security adviser to President Donald Trump, H.R. McMaster, stated at the Munich Security Conference in Germany that the recently unveiled FBI indictments provide incontrovertible evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. McMaster's remarks come in response to the indictment of 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies by a federal grand jury for allegedly interfering in the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nThe indictment, led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, details a sophisticated plot to wage \"information warfare\" against the U.S. The Russian nationals are accused of setting a strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTech giant executives, including those from Facebook and Twitter, testified recently on Capitol Hill that Russia indeed used social media to disrupt the 2016 White House race and sow discord among voters. This is the first indictment against Russian nationals as part of Mueller's probe into whether Trump associates colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 elections.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department made it clear in its case that the indictment does not allege that any of the interference changed the outcome of the presidential race. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel probe, stated at a Friday press conference that \"there is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\"\n\nRussia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, dismissed the indictment, calling it \"just blabber.\" When asked about the indictments, Lavrov replied, \"I have no response. You can publish anything, and we see those indictments multiplying, the statements multiplying.\" He argued that U.S. officials also have said no country influenced the U.S. election results.\n\nThe 37-page indictment, signed by Mueller, states that the actions detailed by prosecutors date back to 2014. The defendants are accused of spreading derogatory information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, denigrating Republican candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and ultimately supporting Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders and then-Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nPresident Trump asserted on Friday that the indictment proved there was \"no collusion\" between his campaign and the Russians. \"Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President,\" Trump tweeted after the indictment was unveiled. \"The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong \u2014 no collusion.\"\n\nThe three entities charged in the indictment are Internet Research Agency LLC, Concord Management and Consulting LLC, and Concord Catering. The 13 Russians charged are Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin, Mikhail Ivanovich Bystrov, Mikhail Leonidovich Burchik, Aleksandra Yuryevna Krylova, Anna Vladislavovna Bogacheva, Sergey Pavlovich Polozov, Maria Anatolyrvna Bovda, Robert Sergetevich Bovda, Dzheykhun Nasimi Ogly, Vadim Vladimirovich Podkopaev, Gleb Igorevich Vasilchenko, Irina Viktorovna Kaverzina, and Vladimir Venkov.",
    " Title: Romney's Remarks on Obama Supporters Spark Controversy, Stirring Debate on Government Dependency and Entitlement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a video released Monday, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney made controversial remarks about President Barack Obama's supporters, describing them as dependent on government and unwilling to take responsibility for their lives. The video, posted on the website of Mother Jones, showed Romney speaking at a private fundraiser earlier this year.\n\nIn the video, Romney stated, \"There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president, no matter what. All right, there are 47% who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what.\"\n\nRomney also said, \"My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\"\n\nIn a hastily scheduled news conference in Costa Mesa Monday night, Romney did not back away from his remarks. \"It's not elegantly stated, let me put it that way,\" Romney said. \"I'm speaking off the cuff in response to a question.\"\n\nThe comments could be read as unflattering to Obama supporters broadly and to millions of people who hold jobs and in many cases pay payroll taxes, but who do not earn enough to pay the income tax. Some of those people receive tax benefits that have been championed by both parties, such as credits for children, which wipe out their tax burdens.\n\nThe incident was reminiscent of Obama's remarks this summer, made famous by his awkward \"you didn't build that\" comment, that were interpreted by Republicans as a disparagement of entrepreneurialism. Democrats said the president meant only that government spending on infrastructure and other programs is important to business owners.\n\nIn other contexts, the candidates have said these competing ideas go to the heart of the election, with Obama arguing for a government role in the economy and Romney saying government is too intrusive.\n\nThe Romney campaign arranged for top Romney adviser Ed Gillespie to speak to reporters Monday amid a set of news stories about the campaign's weakening position in public opinion surveys and after the website Politico posted an article about infighting inside the Romney campaign.\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans have said Romney should lay out more policy specifics, such as which tax breaks he would scrap in order to pay for a 20% cut to tax rates he has proposed for all income brackets.\n\n\"We do think the timing is right, at this moment, to reinforce the specifics\u2014more specifics\u2014about the Romney plan,\" Gillespie said.\n\nRomney did not offer new policy specifics in a speech Monday to small-business owners at the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. He said he would overhaul the legal immigration system. His comments dovetail with House Republicans' effort to pass legislation that would increase the number of visas for workers in fields like engineering and science. A vote is expected this week.",
    " Title: Contact Tracing: A Potential Solution or a Privacy Concern?\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the world grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a new challenge has emerged: contact tracing. Contact tracers are individuals tasked with identifying and questioning people who test positive for the novel coronavirus, tracing their contacts, and advising self-quarantine and self-monitoring for symptoms. While this tactic has proven effective in other countries, the prospect of an army of government interrogators has raised concerns about privacy and potential abuse.\n\nThe National Association of County and City Health Officials estimates that at least 100,000 contact tracers will be needed to keep the virus at bay as communities reopen. New York state, ground zero for America's pandemic crisis, plans to put between 6,400 and 17,000 contact tracers in place. New York City's \"Test and Trace Corps\" will launch with 1,000 contact tracers, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nWhile the Johns Hopkins University, a go-to trainer for many contact tracing programs, offers a free, online, certificate-granting course in contact tracing, ethical considerations, including privacy, are a significant concern. The university's course delves into the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the process of gathering information, and ethical considerations, but it is state, city, and local government agencies that are managing the deployment of the contact tracers they train.\n\nIn Washington state, Gov. Jay Inslee's reopening plan, including an initial 1,371 contact tracers, is raising questions about privacy rights. The state requires restaurants to create a daily log of all customers and maintain that log for 30 days, including telephone/email contact information and time in. This has raised concerns about the collection and storage of personal information.\n\nIn California, Robert Levin, the director of Ventura County Public Health, had to apologize after a contact tracing program announcement during which he gave the impression that isolated individuals would be taken out of their homes and placed in hotels or motels. This type of \"impression\" has contributed to people's reluctance to share details of their shopping trips and social interactions with government-employed strangers.\n\nCooperation with contact tracers is voluntary, but winning people over is critical, as there is no way to make unwilling people cooperate. If public officials can convince the public of the wisdom of their tactics and the innocence of their intentions, maybe we can work together to resolve our health concerns. However, the potential for lying and mistrust remains a significant challenge.\n\nBioethicist Jacob Appel argues that countries with authoritarian governments or high levels of social cohesion have successfully used contact tracing, but the United States does not possess either. The burden is on public officials to demonstrate to our satisfaction that they are deploying an army of helpful contact tracers and not a plague of intrusive cootie cops.",
    " Title: Federal Reserve Lowers Economic Outlook, Hints at Delay in Interest Rate Hike\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a two-day meeting on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered its economic outlook, citing a slowdown in growth during the winter months due to temporary factors such as harsh weather conditions. The Fed's statement did not provide a clear signal for an initial interest rate hike at its June meeting, but policymakers indicated they expect to act this year.\n\nFollowing the announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3%, the S&P 500 index fell 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite declined 0.3%. Yields on 10-year government bonds rose above 2%.\n\nThe Fed stated that economic growth slowed during the winter months, in part due to unusual cold weather. However, it expects the economy to rebound and grow at a moderate pace in the coming months. The Fed's optimistic view did not rule out a June rate increase, but it suggested a delay in raising the target range for the federal funds rate, which has been near zero since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nJob growth moderated, household spending declined, and inflation-adjusted incomes rose strongly, partly due to earlier declines in energy prices. Business investment softened, and exports declined, according to the Fed's statement. Inflation continued to run below the Fed's target, and the government reported that the Fed's preferred measure of inflation rose 0.9% last quarter, the smallest increase since 2010.\n\nEmployers added just 126,000 jobs in March, compared to average monthly gains of 269,000 in the prior 12 months. The government reported that the economy grew at a 0.2% annual rate in the first quarter, down from 2.2% in the October-December period and below the modest 1% pace expected by economists.\n\nThe Fed reiterated that it will raise the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2% target over the medium-term. Many economists predict the Fed is unlikely to act until September at the earliest, allowing time to assess the economy's momentum. This timetable is consistent with the Fed policymakers' median forecast in March and recent speeches by Fed policymakers, including Fed Chair Janet Yellen.",
    " Title: Investigations Mount Against Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: A Closer Look at the Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of revelations that have dominated headlines, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo finds himself at the center of a growing scandal that has raised questions about the use of taxpayer funds, potential abuse of power, and disregard for accepted procedures. The allegations, which have been corroborated by several news organizations, paint a picture of a Secretary of State who has treated his position as a personal fiefdom, with little regard for common decency or the taxpayers' money.\n\nThe scandal began with reports of about two dozen luxurious dinners hosted by Pompeo and his wife Susan at the State Department's Diplomatic Reception Rooms, all paid for by taxpayers. The guest lists, according to NBC News, were made up more of Republican donors and activists than foreign diplomats and policy experts. In fact, nearly 40% of the nearly 500 invitees were from Fox News, NBC reported.\n\nThe scandal deepened last Friday when President Donald Trump announced his intention to fire the State Department's Inspector General, Steve Linick. Inspectors general are Senate-confirmed government officials charged with auditing and investigating potential instances of fraud and abuse in the government. Pompeo acknowledged on Wednesday that he asked Trump to fire Linick, but offered scant explanation for the reason, other than that it should have happened sooner. He called claims that the firing was retribution for probes into his activities \"patently false.\"\n\nHowever, moments after the announcement, Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, dropped a bombshell, revealing that Linick was investigating Pompeo. Engel, with Sen. Bob Menendez, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, opened a probe into the ouster, decrying \"the politically-motivated firing of inspectors general and the President's gutting of these critical positions.\"\n\nLater, NBC reported that Linick was investigating Pompeo's use of a State Department political appointee to conduct personal errands, such as walking his dog and picking up his laundry. Within hours, the accusations grew more disturbing. Engel told CNN of another possible reason for Linick's firing. The inspector general, it turns out, was investigating the declaration of an \"emergency\" that Pompeo had cited one year ago as reason for bypassing the requirement that Congress approve an $8 billion sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe NBC investigation identified the dog-walking staffer, whose name appeared in the emails NBC reviewed in connection with the so-called Madison Dinners. The staffer was the principal liaison between Pompeo's office and the protocol office that organized the dinners. \"Two administration officials told NBC News that Linick made some type of inquiry to the protocol office last week, before he was fired,\" NBC reported. \"One of the officials said Pompeo's office was then notified.\" Whether Linick was also investigating Pompeo's dinners remains unclear.\n\nThe details of the dinners, with their own logo embossed on State Department invitations, brought hundreds of people to the center of US diplomacy more than 20 times since Pompeo became Secretary of State. The events, with their guest lists, suggest an opportunity to further a political career within the Republican establishment rather than an opportunity to discuss complex foreign policy matters.\n\nThe majority of the guests came from the corporate world and conservative media and entertainment, along with Republican members of Congress. Among those wined and dined were Fox News' Laura Ingraham, Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of a prominent anti-abortion lobbying group, Bill Miller, head of a leading casino lobbying group, former Major League Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, Chick-fil-A Chairman Dan Cathy, a leading conservative donor, and others.\n\nSources told NBC that the State Department collected information about each guest, and that information was all forwarded to the private Gmail account of Susan Pompeo, the Secretary of State's wife. Whatever reason she had for receiving the data, it amounts to a treasure trove, should the Secretary of State decide to run for a Kansas Senate seat--or for President. If that is the purpose of the dinners and the emailing, it is a violation of the Hatch Act, which bans most federal employees from using their position for partisan political activities.\n\nThe allegations against Pompeo are still unfolding, and it remains to be seen what the full extent of the Secretary's actions will be. However, the initial revelations are more than enough to raise serious questions about the use of taxpayer funds, the politicization of the State Department, and the Secretary's disregard for accepted procedures and common decency. The American public deserves a full and transparent investigation into these matters, and a thorough accounting of the Secretary's actions.",
    " Title: Unprecedented Victory for Hong Kong's Pro-Democracy Movement in District Council Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nHong Kong's pro-democracy movement has achieved a significant victory in the Chinese territory's district council elections, with early results showing that 17 out of 18 councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. The election, which was seen as a test of support for the government after months of unrest, protests, and clashes, did not materialize the expected show of support from the so-called \"silent majority.\"\n\nDespite fears the vote could be disrupted or cancelled, it proceeded peacefully. The election allowed residents to express their opinion on the handling of the crisis by embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who came to power amidst a now-withdrawn extradition law controversy.\n\nA record 4.1 million people had registered to vote, more than half the population, and more than 2.9 million people cast their votes, resulting in a turnout of over 71%. The weekend was also the first in months without any clashes between protesters and police.\n\nIn many districts, young, first-time candidates, many who had explicitly aligned themselves with the protesters, unseated established politicians backing the government. The hope from activists is that the overwhelming victory of anti-establishment parties will force the government to take protesters' demands more seriously.\n\nOne of the biggest losses for the pro-Beijing camp was lawmaker Junius Ho, who suffered a shock defeat. He has openly voiced his support for Hong Kong's police force on multiple occasions and was filmed shaking hands with a group of men suspected of being triad gangsters who later assaulted pro-democracy protesters.\n\nJimmy Sham, a political activist who has recently risen to prominence as the leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, won a seat after running for the first time. Mr. Sham has also been attacked twice, once apparently with hammers.\n\nPro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was barred from running in the elections, a move he referred to as \"political screening,\" but the pro-democracy candidate who replaced him has won. In a tweet, Mr. Wong said the \"historic\" results showed that public opinion had not turned against the pro-democracy movement.\n\nReflecting on her reported defeat, pro-Beijing lawmaker Alice Mak suggested Ms. Lam's administration was partly to blame. \"In the election campaign, pro-government candidates have been unfairly treated. This is a very important reason,\" she said.\n\nStarry Lee Wai-king, chairwoman of the city's largest pro-Beijing party, was among the few establishment candidates to secure her seat. \"I think [Lee] is the only one who can survive the de facto referendum,\" said Leung Kwok-hung, her pro-democracy opponent in the poll.",
    " Title: GOP Shifts Focus to Legislative Achievements as Midterm Elections Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the midterm elections loom, Republicans are working on a backup plan in case the GOP tax law does not prove to be a strong selling point for their party. While the booming economy is expected to be a core pillar of the GOP's midterm messaging, it remains unclear whether the party will receive credit for the tax law, which has lagged in polls.\n\nIn response, GOP leaders on both sides of the Capitol are emphasizing a breadth of legislative achievements as they seek to convince voters to keep them in charge and not deliver majorities to Democrats. To bolster their case, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) point to a flurry of wide-ranging bills sent to President Trump's desk last month.\n\nIn an interview with a major news outlet last month, McConnell highlighted last year's $1.5 trillion tax-cut package, but also pointed to increased spending for the military, 15 repealed regulations, and the confirmation of a conservative Supreme Court justice and 21 conservative circuit court judges. Ryan and his top lieutenants have made a similar pitch.\n\n\"We're doing more things this week to continue to establish our priorities,\" Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) told reporters Wednesday. \"It's not just lowering taxes for families, but it's taking care of our military and taking care of our veterans.\"\n\nIn another move meant to paint the portrait of Republicans hard at work, McConnell announced Tuesday he would cancel most of the August recess so that senators could work through spending bills and Trump's nominations before a Sept. 30 funding deadline. The decision has the added benefit of keeping dozens of Democratic senators off the campaign trail in August.\n\n\"We think we have a good chance of passing a number of appropriations bills,\" McConnell told reporters during his weekly news conference on Tuesday. \"In order to do that, and deal with this nominations backlog, we need to be here in August.\"\n\nIt remains unclear whether the GOP's messaging strategy will work, especially when accomplishments on Capitol Hill can be easily overshadowed by more dramatic developments coming out of the White House. The same week that Congress sent a trio of bills to Trump's desk, for example, the president dominated the news cycle by canceling a planned historic summit with North Korea.\n\nThe GOP Congress also has come up short on some of Trump's chief priorities, disappointing the president and his most fervent supporters. Despite majorities in both chambers and control of the White House, Republicans failed to repeal and replace Obamacare or fund Trump's signature border wall. Trump has bashed Congress over the failure on the wall in particular, to the chagrin of Republicans, who think it shortchanges the accomplishments that have been secured.\n\n\"I'd like the president to talk about it more often and I believe he will going into the fall campaign,\" McConnell said of the GOP's successes. The effort to push a more aggressive Republican agenda could please some conservatives, who have said tax reform alone is not enough to run on in the midterms.\n\n\"You can't just rest on your laurels,\" Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, told a major news outlet on Wednesday. \"You've got to keep fulfilling your promises to the American people.\"\n\nWhile the tax law's poll numbers have improved, GOP strategists point out that some voters may not see the benefits until next year. There are also concerns that the economic gains from the tax law could be wiped out after Trump slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports worldwide, including from the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. Trump has threatened to follow up with additional tariffs on foreign cars and has also talked about imposing new tariffs on imports from China.\n\nIt can be difficult to accomplish major policy items in election years, with less time on the legislative calendar and vulnerable members reluctant to take any tough votes. But in recent months, Congress has seen an uptick in activity, with Trump signing legislation to ease financial regulations, improve how veterans access health care, and allow terminally ill patients to try experimental drugs. The House, which also passed a bipartisan prison reform bill last month, plans to take up legislation next week to combat the nation's deadly opioid crisis\u2014an issue that resonates strongly in many communities around the country.\n\nCongressional leaders want to avoid passing another short-term funding patch this year and are hoping to move spending legislation through both chambers before the end of September. Since it is the last train leaving the station, lawmakers will surely push to attach a number of priorities to the legislation. But if there are poison pill amendments\u2014or if Trump refuses to sign any spending measure that doesn't contain money for his border wall\u2014it could bring Congress to the brink of another shutdown just weeks before the midterms. That could chip away at the GOP's argument that they are effective legislators.\n\n\"It could be a real mess if it leads to a shutdown,\" said Matt Mackowiak, a GOP strategist and opinion contributor for a major news outlet. \"So there's still some political risk out there for Republicans.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Pursues 19 Separate Steps on Gun Control Without Congressional Approval\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, President Barack Obama is reportedly considering 19 separate steps on gun control that do not require congressional action. These measures, which include stricter gun trafficking laws, increased federal research on gun control, and school safety grants, are part of a broader plan to be unveiled this week.\n\nThe President's proposals will reportedly consist of a mix of measures that require congressional approval and steps he can implement independently. On Monday, during a press conference, Obama stated that he will present his proposals this week, with a focus on measures that are effective and practical rather than politically feasible.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, who is leading a task force on the issue, met with Democratic lawmakers on Monday to discuss potential measures. The specific proposals Obama will present this week remain undisclosed.\n\nOne contentious measure, a potential ban on military-style \"assault weapons,\" is expected to face strong opposition in Congress. Figures such as National Rifle Association President David Keene and U.S. Senator John McCain (Arizona Republican) have predicted that such a ban would not pass through Congress.\n\nIn addition to the assault weapons ban, Congress may also consider limiting high-capacity ammunition clips and implementing universal background checks for gun buyers.

    " Title: Justice Department Declines Appeal, Paving Way for Potential Indictment of Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, a frequent subject of President Donald Trump's criticism, faces the possibility of an indictment after his legal team failed to convince senior Justice Department officials to forego charges related to allegations of lying to internal investigators. Two anonymous sources familiar with the matter revealed this information on Thursday.\n\nThe Deputy Attorney General declined an appeal from McCabe's lawyers aimed at preventing a prosecution. The sources, who were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, spoke on the condition of anonymity. However, it remains unclear when or if the United States Attorney's Office in Washington, which has been spearheading the investigation, will announce charges.\n\nMcCabe's legal team has contended that he should not face charges based on accusations of lying to internal investigators about authorizing a media leak in the fall of 2016. McCabe has maintained that he did not intentionally mislead anyone.\n\nAn indictment of McCabe could reignite public attention on the turbulent months of 2016 when the FBI found itself embroiled in presidential politics, with investigations involving both major candidates\u2014Democrat Hillary Clinton and Trump, her Republican opponent.\n\nWhile prosecutors are expected to concentrate on whether McCabe lied to investigators on specific dates, McCabe's legal team is likely to argue that the prosecution is a result of a political vendetta driven by the president. They are expected to emphasize the personal animosity between the two men, with Trump criticizing McCabe even before he took office and McCabe describing the president as a \"deliberate liar.\"\n\nMcCabe's lawyers have stated that any false statements made to investigators were due to a faulty memory, and that the interviews took place during a tumultuous time for the bureau as it investigated potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nMcCabe assumed the role of acting director of the FBI after Trump fired former Director James Comey on May 9, 2017. McCabe has said his 2018 firing\u2014for what the Justice Department called \"lack of candor\"\u2014was politically motivated. He sued the Justice Department in August, alleging that officials had used the inspector general's conclusions as a pretext to remove FBI leaders perceived as biased against Trump.\n\nThe investigation followed an October 2016 story in The Wall Street Journal that described internal debates within the FBI and the Department of Justice about the aggressiveness of the Clinton Foundation investigation weeks before the presidential election. The article recounted a particularly tense phone call between McCabe and a senior Justice Department official about the investigation.\n\nThe inspector general's report stated that McCabe told internal investigators that he had not authorized anyone at the FBI to speak with the reporter, and he did not know who did. The report also noted that McCabe ultimately corrected that account, and confirmed that he had encouraged the conversation with the reporter to counter a narrative that he thought was false\u2014namely, that he had been trying to stymie investigations into Clinton and the foundation.",
    " Title: Trump Secures Third Consecutive Victory in Nevada Republican Caucuses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Donald Trump has emerged victorious in the Nevada Republican Presidential caucuses on Tuesday, marking his third consecutive win in the primary race. Trump's victory, with 45.9% of the votes, surpasses his two closest rivals, Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, combined.\n\nThe latest victory for Trump, who has been a controversial figure in the political landscape, has shattered the supposed \"ceiling\" on his support, as predicted by political analysts. Trump's support was stronger among every demographic group, including evangelical Christians, Hispanics, and both genders. He also won among Republicans and independents, and among voters from various ideological, educational, and racial backgrounds.\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio and Texas Senator Ted Cruz finished in second and third place, respectively. This result may not significantly boost either candidate's momentum, but it ensures that both remain in the race, which could potentially benefit Trump, as he attacks Cruz as a liar and dismisses Rubio as a lightweight.\n\nThe upcoming Super Tuesday contests, featuring a dozen states, including several in the South, the GOP's traditional stronghold, are set for next week. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, in an uncharacteristically subdued tone, warned supporters that it would be \"the most important night of this campaign.\"\n\nThe theme that runs through Trump's supporters is a sense of concern and dissatisfaction with the current state of the nation. Nearly 94% of caucusgoers expressed a negative view of the government, and six in ten described themselves as \"angry.\" An equal number said they wanted the next president to come from \"outside politics.\"\n\nAt his victory rally in a Las Vegas hotel, Trump highlighted his success with various demographic groups, including Hispanics, young voters, and the \"poorly educated.\" He predicted a \"amazing two months\" ahead, as the primary race moves forward.\n\nTrump's victories in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and now Nevada, over a record-sized field, have expanded the Republican electorate and forged the broadest-based coalition of any of his opponents. The upcoming primaries and caucuses will test this coalition, as the race moves to states like Massachusetts, Vermont, Georgia, and Texas, where nearly a third of Republican convention delegates will be chosen. Two weeks later, with primaries in Florida, Ohio, and elsewhere, nearly two-thirds of the delegates will have been chosen.\n\nThe upcoming contests will provide insights into questions such as whether a single rival can defeat Trump in a head-to-head showdown, and the likelihood of a contested convention for the first time in four decades.",
    " Title: Romney's Campaign Strategy: Distancing from Bush Policies in the Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nDENVER \u2014 The upcoming presidential debate on Wednesday night is expected to see President Barack Obama taking a jab at Mitt Romney, likening his policies to a third term for George W. Bush. The attack is a strategic move by the Obama campaign, aiming to portray Romney as a continuation of Bush's hands-off approach to taxes, spending, and regulation, which, according to Obama, led to the economic crisis.\n\nThe strategy is reminiscent of Obama's successful attack on John McCain four years ago, where he attempted to associate McCain with the recent Republican unpleasantness. Although not as direct, the tactic serves to remind voters of the Republican administration's past and leave conservatives perplexed as to why their nominee has not rebutted the charge or attempted to turn the tables on both recent presidents.\n\nPolling suggests that such a strategy, known as \"triangulation,\" is not an option but a necessity. A CNN poll last month showed that 62 percent of self-described moderates blamed Bush and the Republicans for the country's economic troubles, while only 30 percent faulted Obama and the Democrats. By indicting both parties for America's fiscal problems, Romney could detach himself from Bush and gain credibility with voters tired of Washington's politics.\n\nMichael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, stated, \"Making twin villains of Bush and Obama would blunt Obama's attacks on Romney wanting to return to the Bush policy. And it would help rally those tea party folks who don't think much of Bush or the Republican establishment.\"\n\nAnti-tax crusader Grover Norquist added, \"The speech writes itself.\" The debate is set to take place in Denver, Colorado, and will be the first of three face-to-face meetings between the two candidates before the November election.",
    " Title: Wisconsin's Proposed $100 Million Tax Incentive Package for Kimberly-Clark Sparks Debate on Crony Capitalism\n\nArticle:\n\nA proposed $100 million tax incentive package for Kimberly-Clark, a global paper products manufacturer, has sparked a heated debate in Wisconsin, with critics labeling it as an example of crony capitalism. The plan, aimed at keeping Kimberly-Clark's operations in the state, has been met with criticism from those who argue it undermines free market principles and fiscal responsibility.\n\nIn January, Kimberly-Clark announced plans to cut 13 percent of its global workforce, potentially resulting in the loss of up to 5,500 jobs nationally and the closing of ten of its 91 manufacturing facilities. Two of these facilities are in Neenah and Fox Crossing, Wisconsin, supporting 600 jobs.\n\nThe timing of Kimberly-Clark's announcement is significant, as Wisconsin recently finalized a $3 billion incentive package for technology company FoxConn, which plans to build an enormous $10 billion facility in the state that could employ up to 13,000. The cost of the FoxConn package is substantial, with estimates suggesting it amounts to between $219,000 and $587,000 per job.\n\nSupporters argue that the FoxConn deal offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and Governor Scott Walker has made it a centerpiece of his campaign for a third term. The hope is that it will spur the development of a new Silicon Valley along the western shore of Lake Michigan.\n\nHowever, critics argue that this is a form of central planning, leading to market distortion, an inefficient use of resources, and a narrative of economic development built on myths and hubris. Rick Esenberg, president and general counsel of the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (WILL), and Collin Roth, director of public engagement and a policy analyst at WILL, have expressed their concerns, stating that such incentives serve neither business nor workers.\n\nThe proposed tax incentive package for Kimberly-Clark would offer a 17 percent tax credit for existing jobs paying between $30,000 and $100,000 annually (Wisconsin law currently allows for a 7 percent credit) and a 15 percent capital-investment credit.\n\nCritics argue that the state's economy is already booming, with unemployment below 3 percent, wages rising, and business optimism up. Paying Kimberly-Clark $100 million to \"save\" 600 jobs, they contend, is unnecessary and could retard growth, as workers who stay at Kimberly-Clark are denied the opportunity to fill open jobs at Wisconsin businesses with better long-term prospects.\n\nThe debate highlights the ongoing tension between the desire for economic growth and the principles of free market economics. As the business cycle inevitably turns, the long-term implications of such incentive packages will become increasingly important.",
    " Title: Trump and Clinton Clash in Contentious Second Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis on Sunday night was a heated exchange between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, with both candidates attacking each other's character and policies.\n\nThe debate, moderated by Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz, took place just days after a leaked recording revealed Trump making lewd comments about women. Clinton, who had initially declined to shake hands with Trump, accused him of being unfit for the presidency and of lying throughout the debate. Trump, in response, suggested that if he were elected, Clinton would go to jail.\n\nTrump, however, managed to regain some ground by putting Clinton on the defensive and reminding voters of what they do not like about her. He cited Clinton's destruction of emails that had been subpoenaed by Congress, her handling of the Benghazi attack, her stance on Syrian refugees, and her wavering support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nOne of the most contentious moments of the debate came when Trump was asked about his treatment of women, and he invited four women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or rape to participate in a press conference before the debate. Trump also brought up the dirty tricks campaign waged against Bernie Sanders by Clinton in cahoots with the Democratic National Committee.\n\nClinton, for her part, defended her record and her policies, touting her background in fighting terrorism and her commitment to children and families. She also discussed her plans for the Supreme Court, saying she would look for a justice who would support Roe vs. Wade and marriage equality, and would also appoint someone who would overturn Citizens United, and get dark money out of politics.\n\nThe debate in St. Louis was not a confrontation that made either candidate look noble or appealing. Trump, however, proved he is still in the race to win, and managed to cite Clinton's weaknesses and remind voters of the controversies surrounding her campaign. The election, it seems, will be a choice between two candidates with significant baggage, and the outcome remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Iowa's Des Moines Register Endorses Clinton and Rubio Ahead of Presidential Caucuses, but Impact on Voters Unclear\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has become a tradition since 1988, The Des Moines Register, the most prominent daily newspaper in Iowa, has endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Marco Rubio ahead of the presidential caucuses on February 1. The endorsements, however, may not significantly influence voters, as both candidates' rivals are expected to use the endorsements to their advantage.\n\nIn its dual editorials, The Des Moines Register praised Clinton's \"depth\" of \"knowledge and experience\" and her ability to work across party lines. The paper also commended Rubio for his potential to \"chart a new direction\" for the Republican Party. Despite acknowledging Clinton's email controversy and her changing stances on gay marriage and immigration, the paper argued that she is a more qualified candidate than Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley. Regarding Rubio, the paper noted that he still faces questions over his experience and ability to unite the party, but he could offer an \"uplifting message\" of a new American century.\n\nBoth campaigns quickly shared the respective editorials with their supporters. However, strategists and observers have raised questions about the endorsement's impact on voters, with some suggesting it could even be counterproductive. The Register has endorsed candidates in Iowa's presidential caucuses since 1988, but this cycle's endorsements were given in a politically charged atmosphere where traditional practices have become unwelcome reminders of insiderdom.\n\nThe two Republican candidates most likely to win the caucuses, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, did not seek the paper's endorsement. It remains unclear whether they would have accepted it, as Republican strategists and political observers predict that a Register endorsement could be used as a talking point by rivals, highlighting the winners' alignment with a mainstream media outlet's moderate-to-liberal lean.\n\nDavid Yepsen, who covered politics for The Des Moines Register for 34 years, predicted that the Republican endorsement could backfire. \"I think it will become a point to needle,\" said Yepsen. \"See, we told you he was too liberal.\"\n\nThe Democratic endorsement may be more influential, as The Des Moines Register's left-leaning editorial board tends to connect better with Democrats. The Register would have been hard-pressed to abandon Clinton, whom it backed over then-Senator Barack Obama in late 2007. The paper described her as \"ready\" to lead the country in 2007, and it wrote, \"We believe as president she'll do what she's always done in her life: Throw herself into the job and work hard.\"\n\nClinton won the endorsement despite the paper's editorial board almost entirely turning over since her last campaign. The Register's Saturday endorsements were its 10th and 11th since it first backed Democrat Paul Simon in 1988.\n\nIn a year marked by hostility towards mainstream media institutions, Cruz has warred with the Wall Street Journal editorial board, while Trump has fought with The Des Moines Register itself. The paper wrote an editorial last year slamming Trump for sexist comments, prompting Trump's campaign to deny press credentials to The Register for covering local events.\n\nCandidates can now afford to do battle with prominent outlets, as they have 24/7 exposure. In previous caucus years, endorsements were more meaningful because candidates did not have constant media exposure, and a trusted editorial board was an important liaison to voters. Today, they are only good for a positive news cycle or two, according to Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary to President George W. Bush.\n\nIn the meantime, recipients' rivals will be working to spin the endorsement as a negative, especially on the Republican side, \"with the dislike of all things establishment this cycle,\" said Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.\n\nOver the years, The Des Moines Register has had mediocre luck at picking winners, and former New York Times data expert Nate Silver noted in 2011 that there is little evidence that candidates even received a statistical benefit from the endorsement. That year, the paper endorsed Romney, who lost the Republican caucuses narrowly to Rick Santorum but ultimately became the party's nominee.\n\nIn general, \"I just think newspaper endorsements are kind of an antiquity,\" said Yepsen. \"What it's worth is a little media buzz. The media writes about itself, and the race kind of moves on.\"",
    " Title: Puerto Rico Governor Calls for Cancellation of Whitefish Energy Contract for Power Grid Restoration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Puerto Rico's Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 has called for the cancellation of a contract given to the Montana-based firm, Whitefish Energy, to aid in the rebuilding of the island's power grid. The head of the US-controlled island's power authority, the Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority (Prepa), has accepted the governor's recommendation and intends to terminate the deal.\n\nThe contract, awarded without a public bid process, was given to Whitefish Energy, a company with limited experience in projects of such scale. As of Sunday morning, more than 70% of people on Puerto Rico were without power, over five weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated the power grid.\n\nGovernor Rossell\u00f3 has instructed Prepa to cancel the Whitefish contract and coordinate with the states of Florida and New York to reinforce the brigades currently rebuilding the grid on the island. Concerns have been raised about why Puerto Rican authorities did not request \"mutual aid\" from other public power authorities, as is typical during disasters in the US.\n\nIn response to the news, Whitefish Energy expressed disappointment in the decision, stating that it would delay the restoration of power to the people of Puerto Rico. The company maintains that it secured the $300 million deal in a legitimate manner.\n\nThe White House and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) distanced themselves from the deal last week. The company's headquarters is in the town of Whitefish, the hometown of US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who has denied any involvement or wrongdoing.\n\nEarlier this week, Fema denied allegations by Prepa that it had reviewed the deal. The contract states that \"Prepa hereby represents and warrants that Fema has reviewed and approved of this Contract.\" In a statement on Thursday, Fema stated, \"Any language in any contract between Prepa and Whitefish that states Fema approved that contract is inaccurate.\"\n\nFema also expressed \"significant concerns\" with how Prepa procured the contract and had \"not confirmed whether the contract prices [were] reasonable.\" It is unclear what will happen to any outstanding costs.\n\nPuerto Rican authorities initially said Fema would pay for the deal. They later stated there was \"nothing illegal\" about the contract. Prepa and the Puerto Rican government are burdened with massive debts, with the power authority declaring bankruptcy in July.\n\nThe US House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Caribbean island, is also scrutinizing the contract. On Friday, top Democrats from that panel and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee sent a letter asking the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general to launch an investigation. The correspondence follows similar requests from other members of Congress to the interior department's inspector general.\n\nThe future of the power grid restoration in Puerto Rico remains uncertain as the investigation unfolds.",

The victory came two years after Michigan, a battleground state, helped secure Donald Trump's election victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nDuring the January primary debate, Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) highlighted Whitmer as a female candidate who had proven her ability to win against male competitors in various races across the country. In her election campaign, Whitmer emphasized expanding healthcare and focused on \"dinner-table issues,\" which she stated are central to the party's strength.\n\nWhitmer has maintained a strategy of avoiding divisive, partisan fights by minimizing mentions of President Trump. In an interview with the Associated Press following her selection for the response, Whitmer stated that voters in her state are more concerned with \"fundamentals,\" such as addressing deteriorating roads and offering job training for better-paying positions.\n\nUpon announcing Whitmer as the Democrats' choice for the rebuttal, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) praised the Michigan governor, stating, \"Whether it's pledging to 'Fix the Damn Roads' or investing in climate solutions, Governor Whitmer's vision for the future is exactly what this country needs, and I'm thrilled she is giving the Democratic response.\"\n\nWhitmer echoed Schumer's sentiments, stating, \"These are the fundamentals that people in America are concerned about.\" She added that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi believed her message would resonate with the public.\n\nGovernor Whitmer's response to President Trump's State of the Union address will follow immediately after the president's speech, which is scheduled for 9 p.m. ET on Feb. 4.",
    " Title: \"The Enduring Threat of Mass Surveillance: A Look at the Patriot Act and the Fourth Amendment\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the history of the United States, the Fourth Amendment, a cornerstone of individual liberties, was enacted to prevent the government from engaging in the same practices that sparked the American Revolution. However, in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the Patriot Act was introduced, which, critics argue, has eroded the very principles it was designed to uphold.\n\nThe Patriot Act, enacted in 2001, was passed in haste and with minimal debate, with members of Congress given mere minutes to review its 300-plus pages. Section 505 of the Act allows federal agents to issue their own search warrants, bypassing the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. These agent-written warrants, known as National Security Letters, are not based on probable cause of crime but rather on a representation by one agent to another of governmental needs.\n\nSince 2001, federal agents have issued over 300,000 of these search warrants to custodians of financial records, telecom providers, computer service providers, supermarkets, credit card issuers, health care insurers and providers, legal service providers, local and state governments, and even the Post Office. The concept of one federal agent authorizing another to seize records is antithetical to the Fourth Amendment and repugnant to the American Revolution.\n\nSection 215, which is set to expire on March 15, is equally contentious. It permits designated federal judges to issue general warrants based on the old writs of assistance standard of governmental need. In 2013, a judge signed a search warrant for the telephone records of all Verizon customers in the U.S., at the time numbering 115 million.\n\nBoth Sections 215 and 505 are seen as weapons of mass surveillance and should be repealed. They are instruments of a totalitarian government, not of free people. They defy the Constitution. They presume that our rights are not natural but come from a government that can take them back. Mass surveillance produces a state that knows more about us than we do about it\u2014one that will slowly consume our freedoms in the name of governmental needs. It already has.\n\nJudge Andrew P.

Papadopoulos is set to be sentenced on Sept. 7, with the special counsel recommending a prison sentence of zero to six months.\n\nPapadopoulos and Mifsud had met in London in the spring of 2016, while Papadopoulos was working at a think tank and officially serving as a Trump adviser. Mifsud, a professor who teaches in Malta and circulates among think tanks in Europe, including Russia, is a somewhat enigmatic figure.\n\nAt that time, the public was unaware that Russia had hacked and stolen thousands of emails from the Democratic Party, which would later be published by Wikileaks. The public was, however, aware of the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's deletion of 30,000 emails that could have been relevant to the investigation into her mishandling of classified information during her tenure as secretary of state.\n\nMifsud informed Papadopoulos that the Kremlin possessed \"thousands\" of Clinton emails, a statement whose exact meaning remains unclear.\n\nPapadopoulos lied, the court filing stated, by saying the meeting occurred in February before he joined the campaign instead of the actual April date. \"Rather than acknowledging these contacts and communications,\" the filing said, \"the defendant concealed them from the FBI. He lied about their timing, extent, and nature.\"\n\nThe lies, Mueller added, \"impeded the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\" The defendant's lies, the filing continued, \"substantially hindered investigators' ability to effectively question the Professor when the FBI located him in Washington, D.C., approximately two weeks after the defendant's January 27, 2017, interview. The defendant's lies undermined investigators' ability to challenge the Professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States. The government understands that the Professor left the United States on February 11, 2017, and he has not returned since then.\"\n\nPapadopoulos' self-appointed mission in London was to set up a meeting between candidate Trump and the Kremlin. He asked Mifsud for contacts and spoke to a Russian woman with ties to the Foreign Ministry. However, no such meeting ever transpired, and Papadopoulos has not been charged with any collusion.",

The new policy will place a notice over such tweets, requiring users to click or tap on the warning to view the content.\n\nIn a tweet, Twitter's safety team stated, \"Sometimes, we decide that it may be in the public's interest for certain Tweets to remain on Twitter, even if they would otherwise break our rules.\" The team further added, \"We're going to start using a new notice to make it clear when we make these decisions.\"\n\nThe new policy will apply to verified government officials, political candidates, and people being considered for a government position who have more than 100,000 followers. Before viewing the tweet, users will see a notice that says, \"The Twitter Rules about abusive behavior apply to this Tweet. However, Twitter has determined it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain available.\"\n\nThis change is part of Twitter's recent efforts to combat harassment and abuse on its site. In the past, the company has argued against removing problematic tweets from world leaders, including President Donald Trump, due to their public interest.\n\nPresident Trump, a prolific Twitter user, has on multiple occasions accused social media companies of being biased against conservatives. Social media companies, for their part, have apologized for how they've handled some conservative content, but deny any bias and say they do not censor political views. As of yet, Trump has not tweeted about Twitter's latest move.\n\nIn addition to placing the notice over tweets that break its rules, Twitter said those tweets will appear less prominently on the site and will not show up in places like safe search or the Explore tab.

    " Title: President Trump Stands Firm on Border Wall Funding as Government Shutdown Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for a government funding bill approaches, President Donald Trump has reiterated his commitment to securing funding for the U.S.-Mexico border wall, potentially leading to a partial government shutdown if a deal cannot be reached by December 21. The Democrats, who have previously rejected similar funding proposals, are insisting on limiting funding to $1.6 billion for border security.\n\nIn March, President Trump declared that he would never sign another bloated spending bill like the $1.3 trillion Omnibus bill that did not include funding for the border wall. He has since pledged to fix the country's immigration system, even if it requires a government shutdown.\n\nDuring the last budget impasse, President Trump offered a generous deal to congressional Democrats, agreeing to grant legal status to nearly a million DACA recipients in exchange for border wall funding. However, the Democrats rejected the proposal, despite the $5 billion requested for the wall accounting for less than 0.004 percent of the total amount Congress appropriated.\n\nIf a partial government shutdown occurs, it would primarily affect the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). However, even in the event of a temporary funding lapse for DHS, Border Patrol and ICE agents would still be required to report for duty. Previous shutdowns have resulted in back pay for affected employees.\n\nThe Democrats are portraying a potential shutdown as a national catastrophe, but the reality is that two-thirds of the federal government is already funded, and a shutdown would not significantly impact most federal employees, including those in the armed forces.\n\nHarlan Hill, a political advisor, media commentator, and an advisory board member of the Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., believes that President Trump is not going to abandon his priority of securing the border in the interest of political expediency. The Democrats, according to Hill, are using fearmongering tactics to manipulate public and press opinion.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Hopefuls Face Backlash Over Controversial Remarks on America's Past\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of recent statements, several potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have faced criticism for comments perceived as critical of America's past, sparking a national debate on the party's stance towards the nation's history.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a name often floated in discussions about the 2020 Democratic presidential race, found himself in the midst of a controversy this week after he said America \"was never that great.\" The remark, made during a bill signing, has been interpreted as a critique of President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nCuomo's office has since released a statement clarifying that he believes America is great, but that it has yet to reach its full potential. In a call with reporters, he described the remark as \"inartful.\"\n\nThe comment is the latest in a series of bolder statements from Democrats, who have been calling out what they see as injustices or inequalities in America. The Republican National Committee (RNC) has seized on these remarks, with an email blast this week stating that \"the only thing that seems to unite prominent Democrats these days is their collective bashing of America.\"\n\nPresident Trump, in a series of tweets, criticized Cuomo's statement, calling it a \"career-threatening\" remark and predicting that \"his political career is over.\"\n\nOther potential 2020 candidates have also made remarks that some perceive as critical of America or large segments of its population.\n\nSenator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said in a speech in New Orleans that there is \"a normalcy of injustice\" in America. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said that America's economic inequality is \"fundamentally immoral.\" Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) described America's criminal justice system as \"racist, front to back.\"\n\nThe RNC has pointed to these remarks as evidence that Democrats are out of touch with the public, with a 2016 Washington Post poll finding that only seven percent of those polled said that America has never been great.\n\nThe controversy surrounding these remarks highlights the delicate balance that potential 2020 Democratic candidates must navigate when discussing America's past, as they seek to appeal to both the progressive wing of the party and the broader electorate.",

The only indication of the activity within is a yard sign taped to a door.\n\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, about 20 volunteers gathered to strategize on how to convince their friends, neighbors, and, most importantly, the Massachusetts senator, to join the race.\n\n\"Who's Warren?\" asked retiree Gordon Rowe, describing the reaction he receives when he talks up the Massachusetts senator. \"They don't know who Elizabeth Warren is. I tell them they need to get involved; they're middle class too, and they need representation.\"\n\nThe term \"middle class\" is repeatedly used when discussing Warren supporters. They believe she understands, represents, and will help rebuild the middle class. The conviction that Warren is fighting for them on issues such as income inequality and regulating Wall Street is the driving force behind their effort to draft her into the race, despite her repeated dismissals.\n\nBlair Lawton, Iowa Field Director for the Run Warren Run campaign, acknowledged their current position. \"We totally take Senator Warren at her word right now,\" he said. \"We know that right now she's not running, and if she was, we wouldn't have a reason for a draft campaign like this. Really, me and my staff's goal every day is to show her that she has got support all across the state and a path to victory.\"\n\nTheir strategies include holding meetings to teach volunteers grassroots political techniques, setting up phone banks to call Iowa Democrats, and having Run Warren Run representatives attend small Democratic meetings across the state.\n\nBeth Farvour, a Run Warren Run regional field director, attended a meeting in Tipton, where she explained her reasons for supporting Warren to the 40 or so Cedar County Democrats. Farvour, who spoke before Martin O'Malley, was politely received, as were representatives making similar cases for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Clinton remains the frontrunner at this early stage in Iowa.\n\nThe Run Warren Run campaign is being funded by MoveOn.org, which has pledged to spend $1 million on the effort, and Democracy for America, which has contributed an additional $250,000. In Iowa, the campaign has eight staff members who travel the state promoting her candidacy. Run Warren Run also has staffers in New Hampshire.\n\nWarren's supporters, almost to a person, are hesitant to entertain the possibility that the Massachusetts senator will not run for the White House.\n\n\"I think we can get her in the race,\" said Katie Freerksen, a veterinarian technician who started volunteering three months ago. \"I think we are capable of it, because this has grown so much since I have gotten involved.\"\n\nToria Pinter, a law student on medical leave, was drawn to Warren because of the senator's vocal call to lower the interest rates on student loans. Pinter emphasized that this campaign is not an anti-Clinton effort but a pro-Warren movement.\n\n\"The campaign is not about Clinton,\" she said. \"That's not what we are here to talk about. We are here to talk about Warren and how important she is to us because she embodies the ideals and issues that are important to us at the end of the day.\"\n\nLawton acknowledged the long-term benefits from this campaign, including \"putting a big investment into the progressive community.\"\n\n\"I am confident every day if we do our job we get her to enter this race,\" he said. \"But also, you know, other goals, as well, on top of getting her to run: I want to make sure every time a campaign comes in we are leaving the community in a better place. So really what we are doing right now, by getting volunteers involved and training them, we are really helping to build the progressive movement across the state of Iowa.\"",
    " Title: Obama Administration and Iran Nuclear Deal: A \"Political Agreement\" Instead of a Written Accord\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Obama administration's pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran may result in a \"political agreement\" rather than a written accord, as reported by Western diplomats involved in the negotiations. This development comes as the deadline for a preliminary agreement approaches in the next seven days.\n\nThe lack of a written accord, signed by the Iranians, is a departure from traditional diplomatic practice. Iran has reportedly resisted a formal \"framework\" agreement at this stage, preferring a more general \"understanding\" followed by a final accord in June.\n\nThis development is not entirely unexpected, given the history of the negotiations between the Obama administration and the Ayatollah Khamenei regime. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest has consistently downplayed the significance of the March deadline. In response to a question last Friday about the consequences of a deal not being reached by the end of March, Earnest stated:\n\n\"What we would anticipate at the end of this year is essentially \u2014 or at the end of this month, pardon me \u2014 at the end of this month, we would anticipate a political agreement. What that means is it means some very specific commitments from the Iranians about their nuclear program and about how some of their nuclear facilities are run. It would also include very serious commitments by the Iranians to agree to a set of historically intrusive inspections.\"\n\nHowever, Earnest also noted that the technical experts would require time to discuss the implementation of these political agreements, with the technical negotiations and discussions expected to be resolved by the end of June.\n\nThe New York Times reports that the Khamenei regime does not acknowledge the existence of the March deadline. A senior administration official who was in Lausanne for the talks last week stated that the United States still hoped to agree on specific limits by the end of March, defining the parameters of a more detailed, comprehensive agreement to be completed by the end of June.\n\nThis two-step process, initially envisioned by Secretary of State John Kerry in November, was intended to demonstrate concrete progress to Congress and keep the process with the Iranians moving. However, Ayatollah Khamenei's unexpected statement in early February that there would be only one agreement left the United States and its allies in a precarious position. The March deadline, it seems, was primarily a tool for President Obama to declare victory in \"ending\" Iran's nuclear program before any actual deal is made.\n\nThis development could have significant implications for the Obama administration's legacy and the political landscape of the United States. By securing a \"political agreement\" before the June deadline, Obama may be able to claim a significant foreign policy achievement, potentially influencing the narrative surrounding his legacy and the 2016 presidential election.",
    " Title: GOP's Focus on Healthcare Reform and Midterm Elections Strategy Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the Republican party's agenda appears to be shifting towards a focus on the upcoming midterm elections, with immigration reform and other significant legislative initiatives seemingly taking a back seat. This change in strategy has been confirmed by conservative reporters, including The Washington Post's Robert Costa, who suggests that comprehensive immigration reform, tax reform, and tweaks to the federal health-care law are unlikely to progress in the current Congress.\n\nCosta reports that Republican representatives, such as Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.) and pollster Frank Luntz, have acknowledged the difficulty in passing major legislation in a divided government. Nunes stated, \"We can do a few things on immigration and work on our principles, but in terms of real legislating, we\u2019re unable to get in a good negotiating position.\" Luntz added, \"It is an acknowledgment of where they stand, where nothing can happen in divided government so we may essentially have the status quo.\"\n\nWhile it is not unusual for legislative activity to slow down ahead of an election, the timing of this shift in strategy is noteworthy. February is typically early in the election cycle for one party to transition from policymaking to politicking, especially when the opposing party is actively advancing a positive and popular agenda.\n\nThe Senate has already passed comprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. If Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid uses the Senate to pass (or to force Republicans to filibuster) additional bills, such as renewing emergency unemployment compensation, a Voting Rights Act patch, an equal pay bill, a minimum wage bill, and so on, it will look awkward if the House has little to offer in return.\n\nHealthcare might be the exception, as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has practically committed to passing an Affordable Care Act alternative this year. However, history suggests that this intention may fizzle, leaving Republicans with full repeal \u2013 a political loser \u2013 as their official health care reform platform going into the midterms.\n\nIf the GOP's strategy is to focus solely on the Affordable Care Act, it raises questions about their ability to offer a comprehensive and popular agenda to the public. The electoral map may also contribute to inertia by making the GOP's strategy unfalsifiable. With Senate Democrats defending seats won in 2008 and the House in a midterm three years after they gerrymandered themselves a durable majority, even a bad GOP strategy will likely yield significant gains in the Senate and retention of the House.\n\nThis focus on the Affordable Care Act also raises questions about the GOP's long-term strategy, as winning in 2014 might not require them to offer a broader agenda. However, it may leave them without much to show the public if they watch Democrats actively advancing legislation and begin to wonder what the GOP has to offer other than a single-minded opposition to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis shift in strategy is a departure from the past, as Congressional Democrats in 2006 outlined a broad and thorough agenda and vowed to advance it through the House if they won. When they did win, they let the Bush administration be the story for the next two years but also moved items that lacked GOP support through the House to establish a Democratic agenda. This year's Republicans, however, seem incapable of replicating this approach. Winning in 2014 might not require them to be, but it may leave them without much to show the public if they watch Democrats actually doing things and begin to wonder what the GOP has to offer other than a single-minded opposition to the Affordable Care Act.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Trump Administration's Contraceptive Mandate Accommodation vs. Obama Administration's Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Supreme Court heard arguments this week on the Trump administration's accommodation for the contraceptive mandate, which is in contrast to the Obama administration's policy. The Obama administration's policy, which was aimed at pushing the cost of contraceptive care onto insurers and plan administrators, allowed employers who objected to the coverage to avoid paying for it, while their employees would still be covered automatically.\n\nThe heart of the case is whether the contraceptive mandate and the Obama administration's workaround impose a substantial burden on the religious beliefs of employers. However, if employers are not providing the contraceptive coverage, there is no burden on them.\n\nThe Obama administration's compromise required objecting organizations to simply inform the federal government that they indeed object. From there, the government would have worked with the objectors' health insurers to offer costless contraception directly to their employees. Beyond giving notice, the objectors would have suffered no further involvement and paid nothing for any contraceptive care their employees received.\n\nThe mandate's critics argue that the mere act of giving notice would be intolerable, and that nothing short of offering full exemptions to practically any employer that wants one will do. Federal law demands special care for the concerns of the faithful in striking a balance between religious liberty and governmental interests. It does not insist that there be no balance at all. The Obama administration accommodated all sides in good faith. The court should respect the principled balance that the Obama administration struck.\n\nEvery member of the Supreme Court's conservative majority has, in the past, expressed sympathy for religious objectors seeking exemptions from a generally applicable law. However, each has also expressed a desire to limit federal agencies' discretion to make policy. And on Wednesday, several of those conservative justices appeared to realize that these two goals are in tension\u2014at least in the two Pennsylvania cases.\n\nThe cases primarily ask whether the Trump administration has the power to give religious objectors a sweeping exemption, regardless of whether such an exemption is required by law. At least three of the Court's conservatives, Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh, expressed concerns that the Trump administration may not have this power. In a 2019 opinion, Gorsuch proposed revising the largely defunct 'nondelegation doctrine,' a constitutional doctrine briefly used in the 1930s to restrict Congress's power to delegate authority to the Roosevelt administration. While Gorsuch's opinion in that 2019 case, Gundy v. United States, is vague, it suggests the possibility of a cross-partisan coalition to strike down the broad exemption.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking President Trump's NATO Defense Spending Claims: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a fact-check of President Donald Trump's claims about NATO defense spending, NPR national security correspondent David Welna reports that the U.S. has not been stiffed for unpaid bills by NATO allies, contrary to Trump's assertions.\n\nWelna notes that Trump reiterated his claims about NATO's European allies during a breakfast meeting in Brussels, stating that many countries owe the U.S. a significant amount of money from past years due to the U.S. having to pay for them. However, former Obama administration National Security Council official Aaron O'Connell explains that NATO is not like a club with annual membership fees, and there is no ledger that maintains accounts of what countries pay and owe.\n\nTrump also highlighted Germany's defense spending, stating that the country is only paying 1.25 percent of its GDP, while the U.S. is spending 4.2 percent. However, Germany indeed devotes only about 1.25 percent of its GDP to defense, and while it has increased defense spending the past two years, it does not plan to reach the 2 percent mark by 2024, as agreed upon by NATO members four years ago.\n\nTrump also called on NATO member states to spend 4 percent of their GDP on defense, a figure that is at odds with the Pentagon's estimate of the U.S. defense spending at 3.3 percent of GDP. American University NATO scholar Garret Martin notes that the U.S. defense needs vastly surpass those of its European allies, as the U.S. is a global military power with global military commitments.\n\nLast week at a rally in Montana, Trump made another claim about NATO funding, stating that the U.S. is paying for 70 to 90 percent to protect Europe. However, former NSC staffer O'Connell explains that the U.S. pays 22 percent of a common budget that all NATO allies pay into, not 90 percent.\n\nTrump also sought to take credit for NATO allies spending more, stating that commitments have been made for over $40 billion dollars since the last meeting. However, NATO reported yesterday that spending by European members has increased by $35 billion, not $40 billion. American University's Martin notes that the higher spending continues a trend that predates Trump.\n\nNATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg pointed out that despite Trump's complaints about the U.S. spending too much, it is actually spending more than before. Stoltenberg also noted that U.S. funding for military presence in Europe, the European Deterrence Initiative, has been increased by 40 percent, a spending increase that was approved by Congress.\n\nThe Senate last night and the House today overwhelmingly approved resolutions backing NATO, demonstrating bipartisan support for the military alliance.",
    " Title: Trump and Pence Celebrate Carrier Deal as a Victory for U.S. Job Preservation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move hailed as a successful negotiation, President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence will take a victory lap in Indianapolis on Thursday to highlight the preservation of nearly 1,000 U.S. jobs at Carrier, a manufacturing company based in Indianapolis. The deal, which has been characterized as a demonstration of Trump's commitment to protect U.S. jobs and workers, has been met with praise from both political parties.\n\nKellyanne Conway, Trump's former campaign manager and top adviser, described the Carrier deal as a winning negotiation that could be replicated once Trump takes office. Few details have been revealed about the specifics of the agreement, but it is believed that Carrier will keep about 850 jobs in Indiana and has been offered tax incentives by the state government.\n\nCarrier, which is owned by United Technologies, a larger company based in Connecticut with contracts with the U.S. government, issued a statement on Wednesday, stating that incentives offered by Indiana were \"an important consideration\" in its decision, but offering no further details. The White House downplayed the news, stating that President Obama's policies had created more than 800,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\nTrump's team argues that the Carrier deal shows Trump can build a positive climate for business, behind an overhaul of the tax code and reduction of regulations, that will grow the economy at a faster pace than what has been seen during the Obama years. John Feehery, a Trump supporter and Republican strategist, deemed Trump's use of the bully pulpit to keep American jobs here \"great politics.\"\n\nHowever, fiscally conservative groups are staying quiet about the deal for the time being. If it turns out that Trump and Pence have offered any special concessions to Carrier, either at the federal level or the state level, given that the vice president-elect is still the governor of Indiana, then those free-market groups are likely to cry foul.\n\nThe particulars of this agreement have not been released, but our position on corporate welfare is well-known, and that has not changed, said Brent Gardner, chief government affairs officer at Americans for Prosperity, a major grassroots organization within the network of conservative mega-donors Charles and David Koch.\n\nThe Carrier deal could set a precedent for Trump's approach to job preservation, and it remains to be seen how this will impact U.S. companies and the economy as a whole. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) stated that he had no issues with Trump personally getting involved to prevent the outsourcing of jobs, as long as it is in the best interest of the country.\n\nIn two speeches toward the end of the presidential campaign, Trump argued against using incentives like low-interest loans and tax cuts to entice U.S. firms to stay put. It remains to be seen how Trump's willingness to negotiate one-on-one with a company will impact the free-market orthodoxy of the Republican Party.",
    " Title: Marco Rubio: The Seabiscuit of the 2016 Republican Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the current political landscape, the 2016 Republican primary race bears a striking resemblance to the presidential race of eight years ago. A young, first-term U.S. senator, Marco Rubio, is making his bid for the presidency, much like Barack Obama did in 2008. Despite a stumble in the New Hampshire debate, Rubio remains in a comfortable position, ready to make his move when the opportunity arises.\n\nAmerica, like eight years ago, is seeking renewed hope and a sense of identity, yearning for a leader who will represent the dignity, decorum, and exceptional qualities of the United States. The current campaign trail is marked by a current of anger, as seen in the campaigns of Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, and Bernie Sanders. However, beneath this veneer, there is an undercurrent of optimism for a better future and a leader who embodies the American spirit.\n\nMarco Rubio, in many ways, is reminiscent of the thoroughbred racehorse Seabiscuit. Currently in third place, Rubio is keeping a steady pace, with Cruz and Trump well within his sights. The winner of this race is not the candidate who takes the lead early on, but the one who finishes first at the national convention.\n\nFor Rubio, winning the Republican nomination could be as simple as 3-2-1: finishing third in Iowa, second in New Hampshire, and first in South Carolina, then maintaining a swift pace all the way to Cleveland. If his performance in the New Hampshire debate lands him lower than second, he has more than enough time to regain his stride and overtake the leaders.\n\nAs the race heats up, Rubio and his team need to emphasize several key points. America is not the country of 200 years ago; it is a melting pot of immigrants from all over the world. Rubio, as the son of Cuban-Americans, should highlight his parents' struggle and his rags-to-riches story as an inspiration for all ethnic groups, not just Latinos.\n\nRubio should also address the equality of all ethnic groups and religions in our country, demonstrating his commitment to unity and inclusivity. Investing in big data and data-crunching capabilities, similar to what Ted Cruz did in Iowa, will be crucial in giving Rubio the direction needed to win the race.\n\nRubio finished third in Iowa, but closer to Trump than expected. Now, he hopes to finish second in New Hampshire, behind Trump, and ahead of Cruz. This could give him the momentum to come in first on Feb. 23 in Nevada, where he's been endorsed by Sheldon Adelson's powerful Las Vegas-Review, and then on Feb. 27 in South Carolina, where several key members of his team have strong roots. By Super Tuesday, when voters in 14 states go to the polls, Rubio could already be in the lead.\n\nRubio has been articulate in outlining his plans for issues like immigration, healthcare, and national security, and he has provided more substantive details on his website than any of his opponents. Cruz has criticized Rubio for his involvement with the \"Gang of Eight,\" but seeking bipartisan support to solve problems is a commendable approach, and Rubio should use that to his advantage.\n\nMarco Rubio is a compassionate, brilliant, articulate, focused leader who can rally America to a new era. Now is his time to sharpen his focus, take the lead at the end of the first turn, pace himself in the backstretch, and leave the others in his dust as he sprints to the finish line.",
    " Title: U.S. and Iran Agree on Extension of Nuclear Talks, Amidst Congressional Criticism and Ongoing Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a last-ditch diplomatic effort, the U.S. and its allies have agreed to extend the nuclear talks with Iran by seven months, aiming to limit Tehran's ability to produce nuclear weapons. The extension was announced on Monday, following a week of tough negotiations in Vienna.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and other Western foreign ministers, who gathered in Vienna for the talks, described the extension as the best way forward. Kerry stated, \"We would be fools to walk away.\" However, it appears that little progress was made in the negotiations, with the parties now aiming to agree on specific terms by March 1, with a final agreement to follow four months later.\n\nCriticism from Congress was swift, with powerful Republicans expressing concern that Iran is merely buying time. Members of the new Republican-controlled Congress, set to be sworn in early next year, have already threatened to impose additional sanctions on Iran and may have enough votes to overturn an expected veto by President Barack Obama.\n\nSen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, lamented, \"The one thing the Iranians did not have was time, and now they have 219 days.\" Kirk and Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, who have worked together on oil sanctions, pledged to come forward with a new bipartisan sanctions package after the Republican takeover of the Senate. Menendez stated, \"I'll work to ensure that Iran comprehends that we will not ever permit it to become a threshold nuclear state.\"\n\nThe U.S. administration strongly opposes additional sanctions, fearing it will push Tehran away from the negotiating table. Kerry called for patience, stating, \"I hope congressional skeptics will 'come to see the wisdom' of giving talks an extra 'few months to be able to proceed without sending messages that might be misinterpreted.'\"\n\nIn Tehran, hard-liners may increase pressure on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to break off talks. However, the latest extension appears to have the approval of Khamenei, the ultimate arbiter in Iran. Positive comments by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reflected Khamenei's backing.\n\nRouhani stated, \"Many gaps have been eliminated,\" though he added that the sides were \"still some distance\" from a deal. U.S.-Iran relations have warmed since Rouhani took office last year, and the thaw has extended to the nuclear negotiations.\n\nMonday's decision benefits Iran, as its nuclear program remains frozen but intact, without any of the cuts sought by the U.S. The negotiations will continue, and monthly dole-outs of $700 million in frozen funds will continue. British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond stated, \"We are giving ourselves until March to agree on a text 'that sets out in layman's language what we have agreed to do.'\" Experts will then have four months to \"translate that into precise definitions of what will happen on the ground.\"\n\nAmong the issues the two sides are haggling over are the number and type of centrifuges Iran should be allowed to have, as well as the length of constraints on Tehran's nuclear program. The U.S. and Iran have different views on these matters, with the U.S. pushing for deeper and more lasting cuts in the program than Tehran is willing to give, and Iran insisting on no more than 10 years of constraints.\n\nPast talks have often ended on an acrimonious note, with each side blaming the other for lack of a deal. However, Kerry focused on praise, in an apparent attempt to maintain a relatively cordial atmosphere at the negotiating table. Kerry stated, \"We have made real and substantial progress and we have seen new ideas surface.\" The foreign ministers of the six powers also sought to put a good face on what was achieved.",
    " Title: Gantz and Lieberman Agree to Collaborate, Threatening Netanyahu's Chances of Forming a New Government\n\nArticle:\n\nIsraeli opposition leader Benny Gantz, head of the Blue and White Party, announced on Monday that he had agreed to work with Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the small Yisrael Beiteinu party, in an effort to form a new government following the national elections last week. This development poses a significant setback for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is currently facing corruption charges and is struggling to maintain his grip on power.\n\nIn a statement, Gantz reported that he had held a productive meeting with Lieberman, during which they discussed matters of fundamental principle and determined their intention to assemble a government that would end Israel's political deadlock and avoid a fourth round of elections.\n\nLast week's election, Israel's third in less than a year, saw Netanyahu's Likud party emerge as the largest party. However, with his smaller religious and nationalist allies, Netanyahu secured only 58 seats in parliament, three short of the required 61-seat majority needed to form a new government. Netanyahu's opponents, led by Gantz, control a majority of seats. Yet, beyond their shared animosity towards Netanyahu, there are deep divisions between these parties, including Lieberman's secular, ultra-nationalist party and the Arab-led Joint List.\n\nGantz's announcement with Lieberman represents a step towards unifying the anti-Netanyahu forces, although it remains uncertain whether they can reach a final agreement, let alone a deal with Arab politicians. In the past, Lieberman has branded Arab political leaders as \"terrorist\" sympathizers.\n\n\"We'll continue to discuss the details, formulate our common objectives, and move forward,\" Gantz said.\n\nNetanyahu is determined to remain as prime minister as he prepares to go on trial on March 17. He has been charged with fraud, breach of trust, and accepting bribes in connection to a series of scandals that include accepting expensive gifts from wealthy friends and offering to exchange favors with powerful media moguls. Netanyahu's lawyers have requested a delay in the start of the trial, citing the need for more time to review evidence. Prosecutors on Monday opposed any delays.\n\nIsrael's president, Reuven Rivlin, must decide by next week who to choose as the prime minister-designate. The president typically chooses the candidate he deems has the best chance of forming a governing coalition. Netanyahu has defiantly insisted he won last week's election and accused his opponents of trying to \"steal the elections\" by aligning with Arab-led parties he claimed were hostile to the state. \"I promise you, I am not going anywhere,\" Netanyahu said over the weekend.",
    " Title: President Obama Defends U.S. Airstrikes in Somalia, Cites Improved Procedures and Potential Death of Senior Al-Shabab Commander\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a press conference on Friday, President Obama defended the regular use of drone strikes and other airstrikes by his administration to target terror leaders and training camps in Somalia, Libya, and Yemen. The President acknowledged that in the past, such strikes have inadvertently resulted in civilian casualties, but he emphasized that the procedures for approving such strikes have improved.\n\n\"There has been legitimate criticism that the legal architecture around the use of drone strikes or other kinetic strikes wasn't as precise as it should have been, and there's no doubt that civilians were killed that shouldn't have been,\" Obama said at the end of the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington. \"What I can say with great confidence is that our operating procedures are as rigorous as they have ever been, and that there is a constant evaluation of precisely what we do,\" he added, without offering specifics.\n\nObama's remarks came after the U.S. military announced on Friday that it had conducted an airstrike the previous day targeting a senior terrorist leader in Somalia, Hassan Ali Dhoore, an operational commander of al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-linked terror group. The Pentagon stated that Dhoore was involved in planning a number of attacks, including some that resulted in the deaths of three Americans.\n\n\"In addition to being part of al-Qaeda, Hassan Ali Dhoore was a member of al-Shabab's Amniyat (security and intelligence) wing and was heavily involved in high-profile attack planning in Mogadishu,\" the Pentagon said in a statement.\n\nThe Pentagon stated that officials were still assessing the results of the operation to determine if Dhoore was killed in the strike, but said his death would be a \"significant blow\" to the terror group's operations and ability to conduct attacks. Dhoore is believed to have played a role in the December 25, 2014, attack on Mogadishu International Airport that killed several African Union personnel and a U.S. citizen, as well as the March 27, 2015, attack on the Maka al-Mukarram Hotel in Mogadishu that killed 15 people.\n\nLast month, the Pentagon launched a strike that killed up to 150 militants at a terrorist training camp in Somalia.",
    " Title: The Pursuit of Heroism: A Look into the Fabricated War Stories of Public Figures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of public figures, the truth is often a fluid concept, with many individuals embellishing their pasts to fit the mold of a hero. This trend has been evident in recent years, with numerous politicians, actors, and journalists found to have fabricated or exaggerated their military service records. The latest addition to this dishonor roll is NBC News anchor Brian Williams, who has admitted to peddling a fabricated war story about himself during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nWilliams, a trusted figure in the media, has been a target of public scrutiny after it was revealed that he has told a shifting story about the day he flew aboard a U.S. Army helicopter during the invasion. In later versions, he has said his helicopter was hit and forced down by enemy fire, a version he told last Friday. However, Williams' helicopter was not the one that was hit, as he admitted in a statement to Stars and Stripes.\n\nThis trend of fabricating war stories is not unique to Williams. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan told the prime minister of Israel that he had filmed the Nazi death camp as a U.S. Army photographer. Reagan also shared a version of his death camp story with Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal. However, as Lou Cannon's March 5, 1984, Washington Post article demonstrated, Reagan could not have possibly filmed the death camp because, by his own admission, he never left the country during World War II.\n\nOther politicians called out for military-service fudging include Sen. Richard Blumenthal, President George W. Bush, and Sen. Tom Harkin, who bragged about flying non-existent combat air missions in Vietnam. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also dispensed her own combat blarney during the 2008 campaign, asserting that during the Bosnia war she and her group landed \"under sniper fire\" at an airstrip in Tuzla and \"we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.\"\n\nThis dishonor roll of politicians disturbs few of us because taking liberties with the truth is their default setting. However, we expect higher truth standards from members of the press, right? Brian Williams might not be working as a shoe-leather reporter, but he is as much a journalist as any newspaper rewrite-man. Journalists are paid to be more vigilant than civilians about the stories they tell. Millions listen to Williams because he has sold himself as a truth-teller, not a fabulist. We expect the truth from him, whether he is reading a human-interest piece into NBC's cameras or recounting personal war stories on Dave Letterman's show.\n\nAlas, the human tendency to juice our stories is universal, and it is a temptation that some journalists find impossible to resist. When we tell our personal stories, we tend to add dramatic pauses that will build suspense. In each retelling, we tend to incorporate into it the reactions of the last audience, escalating the drama that got a good reaction, tamping down the events that dragged, and making up stuff to further engage our audiences. We supplement and reshape our stories both subconsciously and deliberately, because there is no public shame like the public shame that follows the telling of a boring tale. If you don't think you don't do the same with your favorite stories, ask your spouse or siblings. They'll happily regale you with your entertaining exaggerations.\n\nJournalists adhere to the same traditional story forms that other, more fanciful tellers use, but with the proviso that they don't embellish. This is the journalistic commandment that Williams broke, and you can see it happening in the timeline of his changing stories compiled by CNN. Williams' early tellings are accurate but boring. After a few years and a few tellings, Williams begins to conform to the \"juice\" model, adding details about the \"dangers\" he faced as his helicopter was hit. Perhaps Williams thought it was okay for him to embellish because he was off the clock. Sorry, Brian, a journalist is never off the clock, especially when speaking to thousands or millions at a time.\n\nAmericans lie about their military records to themselves with such regularity that a couple of years ago Congress passed a law prohibiting such acts of \"stolen valor.\" (Wisely, the Supreme Court struck the law down as injurious to the First Amendment.) For reasons any evolutionary psychology professor can explain to you, everybody wants to be the hero and nobody wants to be the coward. Not to get too psychoanalytic on Williams, but maybe he stretched his mundane helicopter story into an exhilarating but false one because he feels guilty about having gone to war the easiest way possible\u2014in the company of well-protected generals.\n\n\"The allure of a hero's status can be irresistible,\" says scholar W. Joseph Campbell, who has written extensively on media myths. \"It's a warping, cinematic effect.\" You'd think that Brian Williams, a mega-successful, handsome, funny, high-status multimillionaire journalist wouldn't need laurels beyond the ones he's already collected. You'd be wrong.",
    " Title: Indiana Governor Mike Pence Endorses Ted Cruz, Praises Donald Trump Ahead of Indiana Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIndiana Governor Mike Pence has announced his endorsement of Republican candidate Ted Cruz for the upcoming Indiana primary on Tuesday. In an interview on WIBC radio in Indianapolis, Pence praised Cruz as a \"principled conservative\" who has \"stood up for taxpayers\" in Washington and has shown \"strong, unwavering stand\" against abortion rights.\n\nHowever, Pence seemed to go out of his way to praise Republican front-runner Donald Trump as well. He commended Trump for giving voice to people's frustrations and for taking a stand for Hoosier jobs. Pence also expressed gratitude towards Trump for his voice in the national debate.\n\nDespite his endorsement, Pence emphasized that his decision was not intended to sway the votes of Indiana Republicans. \"I respect the right of every Hoosier in making their determination,\" Pence said, adding, \"I encourage everyone to make up their own mind.\"\n\nPence's endorsement is significant as he is running for re-election this fall and has been seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate in the past. Cruz is hoping that Pence's endorsement will give him a boost in the Hoosier State, where he is currently trailing Trump in recent surveys.\n\nCruz was also helped by Scott Walker's endorsement in Wisconsin, which gave Cruz his only big-state primary victory so far in this campaign. However, Cruz's endorsement by Pence was far less forceful than Cruz would probably have liked.\n\nThere are 57 delegates at stake in Indiana on Tuesday. If Trump sweeps those delegates, his path to the nomination not only becomes clear, but likely. Currently, he needs 42 percent of remaining delegates to win, which is very doable. If he wins all of Indiana's 57 delegates, that drops to 36 percent.",
    " Title: GOP Candidates Engage in Policy Discussion at Kemp Forum, Stepping Away from Campaign Trail's Heated Rhetoric\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from the heated rhetoric and controversial statements that have characterized much of the 2016 Republican primary race, several GOP candidates gathered at the Kemp Forum on Expanding Opportunity in Columbia, South Carolina, for a five-hour discussion focused on policy proposals and ideas to alleviate poverty. The event, which took place on Saturday, was a stark contrast to the rallies of front-runners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, who were not in attendance.\n\nThe forum, moderated by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott, provided a platform for candidates such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to discuss vital, if mundane, policy proposals. Ohio Gov. John Kasich also participated, highlighting his legislative background and his role in the first set of welfare reform legislation.\n\nThe event was a breath of fresh air, according to Ryan, who noted that it offered candidates more than 30 seconds to discuss issues and engage in substantive conversations. The change in tone was welcomed by many, with candidates praising the forum's focus on policy and ideas.\n\nIn contrast, the night before the GOP poverty event, Trump held a boisterous rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, where he praised the capture of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, had a Muslim woman who silently protested during the event kicked out, and rallied the crowd with exclamations about his plans to \"knock the sh-- out of ISIS.\" Meanwhile, Cruz made headlines in Iowa with a comparison of spanking his daughter to the spanking Hillary Clinton could receive from voters.\n\nParticipants at the Kemp Forum, including Kasich and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, praised the event's focus on substantive conversation, with Graham noting that the primary chatter had taken a welcome break. Graham, who sparred with Trump before dropping out of the race last month, commented on the difference in tone between the event and Trump's rallies, stating, \"If you are real loud here, you are a jerk.\"\n\nAfter the forum, Kasich expressed his long-held desire for a more substantive conversation to be integral to the presidential campaign process. \"In the debate, you get six minutes in two hours,\" Kasich said. \"People can't see your personality. They can't see what you are made of. They can't see your heart. It's extremely difficult.\"\n\nThe candidates appeared to revel in the nonconfrontational environment, with Bush, who has struggled to break through, discussing his policy positions on block grants, the need to focus on marriage, and creating a work-based competency system. Christie also spent several minutes discussing the details of the earned income tax credit and how increasing the refundable tax credit incentivized poor people to seek employment.\n\nWhile the candidates largely agreed on the issues discussed, the afternoon session with Kasich and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) was interrupted multiple times by young immigration protesters. The protesters, who were quickly escorted out by police, targeted Rubio's position on the country's immigration laws. However, even this interruption did not cause a break in the comity.\n\n\"We're going to enforce our immigration laws, guys,\" Rubio responded to raucous applause. Kasich quickly added some backup to defuse the situation, stating, \"We heard it. Thank you very much.\" The Kemp Forum on Expanding Opportunity provided a rare moment of substantive policy discussion in the 2016 campaign, offering a glimpse into the candidates' policy positions and ideas for addressing poverty.",
    " Title: What Happens to Campaign Contributions When a Presidential Candidate Drops Out? A Guide for Donors\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent shake-up of the 2020 presidential race, Washington Governor Jay Inslee and former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper have both dropped out of the race, with Hickenlooper announcing his Senate bid. As of June, both former candidates raised nearly $8.5 million in campaign contributions from individual donors and Political Action Committees (PACs). With the third round of debates in Houston approaching, more candidates may follow suit, leaving millions in campaign donations in their wake. But what happens to these contributions when a presidential candidate drops out of the race?\n\nAccording to rules set forth by the Federal Election Committee (FEC), any excess campaign funds are not allowed for personal use. However, the world of campaign finance is needlessly complicated.\n\nIf you've donated $25 to a candidate, part of your donation might be used to pay off any outstanding debt or expenses. This could mean paying salaries for campaign staff or even moving expenses. If a campaign hasn't accrued any debt, it's likely part of your $25 might be used for that candidate's future campaigns.\n\nCandidates also have the ability to use your donation to purchase \"gifts,\" so long as they are not given to the candidate's family. What constitutes a \"gift,\" however, seems pretty open-ended.\n\nLess likely alternatives include a candidate using your $25 to support a political action committee they support or another candidate in a race (though they'd probably prefer to keep it). Your contribution could also be donated to charities at your candidate's choosing.\n\nThe FEC's rules are vague, and candidates adhere to them in whatever way they see fit. This brings us to a big, glaring question\u2014how can you be sure your donation has been used appropriately?\n\nWhile you can never be 100% sure how your individual donation is spent, you can research a campaign's spending throughout and after a presidential bid is over. \"Once a campaign has ended, a candidate's committee must continue to file FEC reports until the committee is terminated,\" a spokesperson for the FEC said in an email. \"So it's possible to track how the campaigns spend any residual funds they maintain.\"\n\nTo view these reports, visit the FEC database, search by a candidate's campaign name\u2014which typically consists of their last name, followed by \"For America\" or \"2020\"\u2014and scroll to the bottom of the page to find their expenses. To find Inslee's campaign, search for \"Inslee for America.\" To find Hickenlooper's campaign, search for \"Hickenlooper 2020.\" You can search for any former presidential candidate's campaign from any other election, as well.\n\nThere are limits to these filings. For one, they're generally updated quarterly; if you donated to Inslee or Hickenlooper, you won't know how they're spending excess funds until September. Also, you'll have to do a lot of digging into candidates' expenses, and even then, you can't fully interpret a simple line item.\n\nNone of this should dissuade you from donating to a candidate of your choosing. In fact, it should provide incentive to vote for a candidate who promotes campaign finance reform, so that your future contributions are spent wisely.",
    " Title: Republican Anxiety Over Romney's Campaign Strategy Spreads Across Battleground States\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the presidential race between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama heats up, a sense of anxiety among Republicans about the Republican candidate's campaign strategy and his own miscues has spread beyond Washington. Republican strategists across the country have expressed concern about being asked about Romney's remarks, creating an unwelcome potential trap for those in tight races.\n\nRomney has attempted to turn the issue against Obama, labeling the president as an advocate of redistributing wealth and emphasizing, \"My campaign is about the 100 percent of America.\" However, during a Univision forum in Coral Gables, Florida, Obama focused on Romney's \"47 percent\" comments.\n\n\"My thinking is maybe you haven't gotten around a lot,\" Obama said about Romney.\n\nThere is a growing sense of frustration among Republicans that Romney has yet to take a commanding lead in any of the major battleground states, particularly North Carolina, which has the nation's fifth-worst unemployment rate, or Nevada, which has the nation's highest jobless rate, 12 percent.\n\nIn Ohio, Florida, and Colorado, Republicans who support Romney's efforts have expressed concern that he is not campaigning enough in their states and that resources are not trickling into vital counties. A.J. Matthews, a Republican State Committee member from Hillsborough County, Florida, said, \"Could we use yard signs? Could we use information data? What would we most like from Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan? Visit us more.\"\n\nIn Ohio, some Republicans have expressed concern that Romney is not spending more money and appearing more frequently in rural counties where he needs a strong turnout to win the state\u2014and where his \"47 percent\" comments threaten to undercut support among working-class voters otherwise inclined to vote for him. A bus trip by Romney next week may address some of these worries.\n\nIn Colorado, Dick Wadhams, a longtime Republican strategist and a former state party chairman, said he hoped to see Romney campaign harder for swing voters in suburban Denver, and he was pleased the candidate was planning to visit the state on Sunday, the first time in seven weeks.\n\nSpeaking of those swing voters, Wadhams said, \"They want to vote against Obama, but they haven't quite come to the point where they're going to vote for Romney.\"\n\nWadhams and other party leaders said, however, that they were heartened by Romney's get-out-the-vote operations. Republicans say Romney's on-the-ground efforts are far superior to those of Senator John McCain in 2008.\n\nOfficials at the Romney campaign said they believed some of the concern in the tossup states was being created by what they described as hyped news media reporting on Romney's latest missteps. The campaign has been meticulously thought out, they said, and its supporters have yet to see activity that, by design, was not scheduled to begin until near the end of the race.\n\n\"We're making some very strategic decisions,\" said Rich Beeson, the political director. \"And when we're coming down to the end, you'll see the governor everywhere he needs to be.\"\n\nRomney has yet to take command of any battleground states, according to polls, many of which show Obama with an edge. The Romney campaign has been focusing on Iowa as one of its more promising states, but an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist College poll released Thursday evening showed Obama with an 8-point advantage there.\n\nIn a stop near Des Moines, Ann Romney said it was time for Republicans to stop second-guessing her husband. \"Stop it. This is hard,\" she told Radio Iowa. \"You want to try it? Get in the ring.\"\n\nThe president and his aides are aware that everything could change in an instant, particularly with three presidential debates looming, and said Democrats could not be complacent.\n\nBut for the first time in many months, Mr. Obama's job approval rating has reached 50 percent in several recent polls. He has taken the edge away from Romney on questions of who voters believe will be a better steward of the economy, which coincides with the release of modestly positive economic signals.\n\nConstruction of new houses and home sales have reached their highest levels in more than two years, new reports show, and the Census Bureau reported that the number of young adults living at home with their parents\u2014a vivid indicator of the personal effect of the recession on young people\u2014is dropping.\n\nYet the president must still contend with his campaign promises made four years ago, including his pledge to change Washington. When asked about that Thursday during the Univision forum, he said change must come from the \"outside.\"\n\nSpeaking to supporters in Sarasota, Florida, Romney seized on the remark as an admission of failure, saying, \"The president today threw in the white flag of surrender. He went from the president of change to the president who can't get change.\"\n\nFor all of the open fretting among Republicans, several party leaders say Romney still has an opportunity to win over voters who are ready to reject Obama.\n\n\"Romney has not made the sale yet with the 5 or 10 percent that are undecided, and he very well could,\" said Mike DeWine, Ohio's attorney general. \"It's a very doable thing for Romney to win Ohio and very doable for him to win the race.\"\n\nAs Romney headed to an evening fund-raiser in West Palm Beach, Florida, a reporter asked if he would be campaigning more extensively.\n\n\"Ha, ha. We're in the stretch, aren't we?\" Romney said before promptly changing the subject and pointing to the sky. \"Look at those clouds. It's beautiful. Look at those things.\"",
    " Title: North Korea Renews Tensions with Missile Launch Over Japan, World Powers Respond\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a sudden escalation of tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, North Korea launched a midrange ballistic missile over Japan on Tuesday, a move that has been met with strong condemnation from the international community. The missile, capable of carrying a nuclear payload, flew over Japanese territory and landed in the northern Pacific Ocean.\n\nPresident Trump, in a statement released by the White House, called the launch a \"grave\" threat and a \"dangerous precedent.\" He stated, \"The world has received North Korea\u2019s latest message loud and clear: this regime has signaled its contempt for its neighbors, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behavior.\"\n\nThe President continued, \"Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime\u2019s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table.\"\n\nThe launch, which reportedly did not pose a threat to North America, has been met with a strong response from the United States and its allies. The Pentagon is currently investigating the launch, and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has determined that the missile launch did not pose a threat to North America.\n\nIn response to the launch, South Korea conducted a live-fire drill involving powerful bombs, with four F-15 fighters dropping eight MK-84 bombs that accurately hit targets at a military field near South Korea's eastern coast. Each bomb has an explosive yield of a ton, according to South Korea's air force.\n\nThe latest launch comes days after North Korea fired what was assessed as three short-range ballistic missiles into the sea and a month after its second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The ICBM test, analysts say, could reach deep into the U.S. mainland when perfected.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies are particularly concerned about the latest test, as it puts North Korea a step closer to its goal of an arsenal of nuclear missiles that can reliably target the United States. The situation has been further complicated by escalating rhetoric between North Korea and the U.S., with President Trump earlier this month threatening Kim Jong Un's regime with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nIn response to the latest round of provocations, the U.S. and Japan have committed to increasing pressure on North Korea and convincing the international community to do the same. The U.S. and Japan have also pledged to work together to counter North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nThe situation remains fluid, and it is unclear what the next move will be from North Korea or the international community. However, it is clear that the latest missile launch has renewed tensions in the region and raised concerns about the potential for further escalation.",
    " Title: White House Refuses to Comment on President's Involvement in Ongoing National Security Leaks Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the U.S. Justice Department investigates recent high-level national security leaks from the White House, a top adviser to President Obama, David Plouffe, declined to confirm whether the president will answer investigators' questions during an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nThe White House has announced an investigation into the leaking of classified national security information to a New York Times reporter, which led to a series of recent stories. The leaks included details of a top-secret \"kill list,\" a list of targets for drone strikes assembled by the president's national security team, as well as information on a U.S. cyberattack on Iranian infrastructure and confirmation of a mole inside al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nSome congressional Republicans and political pundits have speculated that the leaks were authorized by the White House to boost President Obama's re-election campaign by bringing his national security record back into the spotlight. However, the truth of this theory remains unclear.\n\nSen. Joe Lieberman, Connecticut independent, expressed concern over the leaks, stating that the disclosure of cyberwarfare against Iran could lead to a retaliatory strike. He also suggested that the administration should appoint independent prosecutors to investigate the matter, rather than relying on investigators who report directly to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.\n\nThe White House has so far rejected calls for independent prosecutors, with David Plouffe stating that the appointment of two U.S. attorneys is a \"smart move.\" Despite being pressed on the question, Plouffe would not confirm whether the president would agree to one-on-one interviews with the investigators, as former President George W. Bush did during the probe into the public disclosure of former CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity.\n\nSen. Lieberman and others are now urging the administration to follow the Bush administration's playbook by cooperating fully with the investigation and eliminating any appearance that people in the administration leaked the highly classified information for political or personal purposes.",
    " Title: \"Political Polarization in the United States: A Deep Dive into the Divide\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent correspondence with a long-time friend, a stark reminder of the deep political divide in the United States was brought to light. The friend, a Republican, stands out as one of the few in an extended family predominantly made up of Democrats. This observation, while anecdotal, seems to reflect a broader trend of political polarization in the country.\n\nTo substantiate this claim, one needs to look no further than the Pew Research Center's findings from 2014, based on interviews with 10,000 adults. The report revealed that the number of Americans expressing consistently conservative or consistently liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades, from 10 percent to 21 percent. The report also showed that ideological overlap has diminished, with 92 percent of Republicans being to the right of the median Democrat, and 94 percent of Democrats being to the left of the median Republican.\n\nThe report further highlighted that many in the political center stay on the edges of the political process, while the most ideological make their voices heard. Two-thirds of consistent conservatives and half of liberals say most of their close friends share their political views, a statistic that might come as a shock.\n\nThe divide between the two major political parties is not just limited to ideology but extends to perceptions of the opposition. Two-thirds of conservative Republicans think the Democratic policies threaten the nation's well-being, while the corresponding number for Democrats is 50 percent. Since 1994, highly negative views of the opposition party have doubled, with 43 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of Democrats holding such views.\n\nNational Journal's Ron Brownstein suggests that this divide is not going to go away anytime soon. Essentially, the U.S. is witnessing a durable standoff between a diverse, younger, urbanized, more secular Democratic coalition and a predominantly white, older, non-urban, and more religious Republican coalition.\n\nThe cause of this political polarization is a topic of ongoing debate. Some suggest that partisan news media and the internet have played a significant role in shaping and reinforcing political views. However, finding a solution to this problem remains elusive.\n\nIn conclusion, the political landscape of the United States is marked by a deep divide that extends beyond the two major political parties. This divide, while complex and multifaceted, is a reality that cannot be ignored. Understanding and addressing this issue is crucial for the health and stability of American democracy.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Announce Higher Tariffs as Trade War Escalates, Global Markets React\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sent shockwaves through global markets, the United States and China have announced higher tariffs on each other's goods, intensifying the ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next month at the G20 summit in Japan. This announcement came after China announced earlier that it would impose higher tariffs on a range of U.S. goods, including frozen vegetables and liquefied natural gas.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative's office later announced plans to hold a public hearing next month on the possibility of imposing duties of up to 25% on a further $300 billion worth of imports from China. Cellphones and laptops would be included in that list, but pharmaceuticals would be excluded, the office said.\n\nThe prospect of a no-holds-barred dispute between the U.S. and China that could derail the global economy has rattled investors, leading to a sharp selloff on equities markets in the past week. A gauge of global stocks shed a further 1.9% on Monday, its biggest one-day drop in more than five months. China's yuan currency fell to its lowest level since December, and oil futures slumped.\n\nTrump said he would talk to Xi at the G20 summit and expressed optimism about the meeting, saying, \"Maybe something will happen. We're going to be meeting, as you know, at the G20 in Japan and that'll be, I think, probably a very fruitful meeting.\"\n\nSpeaking at a White House dinner gathering later, Trump said it should be clear in \"three or four weeks\" if a U.S. trade delegation's trip to Beijing two weeks ago was successful. \"I have a feeling it's going to be very successful,\" Trump said.\n\nChina's top diplomat, State Councilor Wang Yi, said during a trip to Russia that China-U.S. talks were not a \"one-way street\" and needed to be conducted on the basis of equality. \"Both countries' negotiating teams have the ability and wisdom to resolve each other's reasonable demands, and in the end, reach a mutually beneficial, win-win agreement,\" he said.\n\nU.S. farmers are among those most affected by the trade war, with soybean sales to China plummeting, and U.S. soybean futures hitting their lowest level in a decade. Trump said on Monday his administration was planning to provide about $15 billion to help farmers whose products might be targeted.\n\nChina also announced plans to set import tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on 5,140 U.S. products on a $60 billion target list. It said the tariffs would take effect on June 1. China's finance ministry said the tariffs were a response to U.S. unilateralism and protectionism, and it hoped the U.S. would get back to the right track of bilateral trade and economic consultations and meet with China halfway.\n\nEconomists and industry consultants maintain that it is U.S. businesses that will pay the costs of the tariffs and likely pass them on to consumers. Goldman Sachs economists said in a research note that the costs of Washington's tariffs on China last year had fallen entirely on U.S. businesses and households, with no clear reduction in prices charged by Chinese exporters. They said the effects of the tariffs had spilled over noticeably to the prices charged by U.S. producers competing with goods affected by the levies.",
    " Title: Sen. Doug Jones Announces Support for Trump Impeachment Conviction on Both Articles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) announced his decision to vote for the conviction of President Donald Trump on both articles of impeachment. The Senate is set to vote on the two House-passed articles later in the day.\n\nJones, who is considered one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats running in November, stated, \"After many sleepless nights, I have reluctantly concluded that the evidence is sufficient to convict the President for both abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\"\n\nThe Alabama senator's announcement comes hours before the Senate votes on the two articles: abuse of power over the delayed Ukraine aid and obstructing Congress's investigations into those actions. Jones, who has been undecided on his vote for weeks, told reporters on Monday that he was \"getting there\" but still wanted to review notes and consult with colleagues.\n\nJones sparked speculation last month that he could split his votes, expressing concerns about the House manager's second article of impeachment, which deals with alleged obstruction of Congress. However, on Wednesday, Jones acknowledged that the second article \"gave me even more pause,\" adding that he \"struggled to understand\" the House's strategy.\n\n\"However, after careful consideration of the evidence developed in the hearings, the public disclosures, the legal precedents, and the trial, I believe the President deliberately and unconstitutionally obstructed Congress by refusing to cooperate with the investigation in any way,\" Jones said.\n\nJones added that Trump's actions \"demonstrate a belief that he is above the law\" and, if left unchecked, would risk guaranteeing that no future whistleblower or witness would ever come forward and no future President would be subject to Congressional oversight.\n\nOn the first article, abuse of power, Jones said he was \"deeply troubled\" by the arguments from Trump's legal team. \"The President\u2019s actions placed his personal interests well above the national interests and threatened the security of the United States, our allies in Europe, and our ally Ukraine. His actions were more than simply inappropriate. They were an abuse of power,\" Jones said.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking Biden's Claim on Lack of Oversight in Coronavirus Relief Effort\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a virtual rally in Wisconsin, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden asserted that President Trump was implementing the coronavirus relief effort with \"no oversight, no IGs [Inspectors General], no accountability.\" However, this statement appears to be inaccurate, as the CARES Act, the legislation that established the relief program, has outlined several methods of oversight for the coronavirus relief effort.\n\nThe most significant oversight body is the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, established by Section 15010 of the CARES Act. The committee's responsibilities include auditing the economic relief funds to prevent waste and abuse and ensuring the money is efficiently distributed. The CARES Act outlines the membership of the committee, which includes the inspectors general of various departments, such as Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury, among others.\n\nThe CARES Act also created a special inspector general for pandemic recovery, whose duties include conducting audits and investigations of the loans, loan guarantees, and other investments made by the Secretary of the Treasury under any program established by the Secretary under the Act. The position is currently vacant, with President Trump having nominated his senior associate counsel, Brian Miller.\n\nFurthermore, the CARES Act established the Congressional Oversight Commission, tasked with overseeing the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve's lending practices to create transparency about how the money is being used and determine the economic impact of the loans. The commission is made up of five members, with each party leader in the House and Senate appointing one member, and the leaders of each chamber picking a fifth member with consultation from the minority party leaders.\n\nPresident Trump's actions regarding the inspectors general on the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee and his choice for a special inspector general have earned him criticism. Trump has also stated he disagrees with certain elements of the CARES Act oversight provisions and has said he won't abide by the Act in allowing the special inspector general to issue reports to Congress without \"presidential supervision.\"\n\nIn light of the above, it is inaccurate to claim, as Biden did, that there is \"no oversight, no IGs [Inspectors General], no accountability\" in the coronavirus economic relief effort. Biden's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Immigration Bill Dismissed by White House as Non-Starter Ahead of Senate Introduction\n\nA bipartisan immigration bill, brokered by Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Chris Coons (D-DE), is set to be introduced in the Senate on Monday. The bill aims to grant eventual citizenship to undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. since 2013 and arrived as children, but it does not address all of President Trump's stated immigration priorities, such as ending family-based immigration categories or the diversity visa program.\n\nThe bill does not immediately authorize the $30 billion for the border wall that Trump is seeking, instead greenlighting a study of border security needs. The bill also seeks to address the number of undocumented immigrants staying in the U.S. by increasing the number of resources for the immigration courts, where cases can take years to finish.\n\nThe bill is a companion to a House legislation that has 54 co-sponsors split evenly by party. However, the White House has dismissed the effort, with a White House official telling CNN that the bill is worse than the Graham-Durbin immigration bill. President Trump also tweeted about the latest immigration efforts, stating that any deal on DACA that does not include strong border security and the desperately needed wall is a waste of time.\n\nSenator Coons defended the bill in a conference call with reporters on Monday, calling it a \"strong starting place\" and a \"fresh start\" if other talks about immigration do not result in a compromise. The White House has been aware of the legislation for weeks, with officials being informed while it was being drafted and with Chief of Staff John Kelly and Legislative Director Marc Short being briefed on the bill in meetings with members of Congress.\n\nThe bill would create a \"smart wall\" where the Department of Homeland Security would gain \"operational control\" of the border by the end of 2020 through \"technology, physical barriers, levees, tools, and other devices.\" On family-based migration, the bill does not make explicit reference to sponsoring relatives, but the bill authors say that existing law would prohibit parents of these individuals who came to the U.S. illegally to apply for a visa to come back without returning to their home country for at least 10 years before applying, and the bill does nothing to erase that requirement.\n\nCoons said that McCain approached him about being a co-sponsor, stating that McCain is deeply concerned about the lack of future certainty for the military because of a budget impasse and the lack of a broader deal on immigration issues, and wanted to find a partner to introduce the Hurd-Aguilar bill in the Senate as part of that effort. Coons also had some harsh words for the President, saying that despite the White House saying his proposal is the only one that can move forward, \"I'm sorry, that's not how the Senate works.\" He rejected White House criticism of his proposal and said the \"worst\" thing would be failing to act or only doing a one-year stopgap.\n\nThe Senate is expected to turn to a floor debate on immigration soon, and Coons has been part of a group of bipartisan lawmakers that have been meeting for weeks to try to find a compromise that could pass the vote with more than the 60 votes needed to advance legislation, which would require members of both parties. McCain has been recuperating from cancer treatments but is a veteran of efforts to pass immigration reform.",

    " Title: Supreme Court to Review Same-Sex Marriage Cases: A Milestone in the Legal Battle for LGBT Equality\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development for the ongoing legal battle over same-sex marriage, the United States Supreme Court has agreed to review two landmark cases: Windsor v. United States and Hollingsworth v. Perry. The cases, which challenge the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and California's Proposition 8, respectively, were granted review on Friday, signaling a potential turning point in the fight for LGBT equality.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to take up these cases comes as same-sex couples in Washington state began exchanging wedding vows following the state's legalization of same-sex marriage last month. The federal law and Proposition 8 both define marriage as the union between one man and one woman, and four justices had to agree for a case to be heard.\n\nGay rights activists, such as James Esseks, litigation director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender & AIDS Project, expressed cautious optimism. \"This is it\u2014the Supreme Court marriage moment that the ACLU has been working towards for years,\" Esseks said. \"These cases are poised not just to take down DOMA and Prop 8, but to be the next building blocks for LGBT equality more broadly.\"\n\nTraditional-values groups, however, remain concerned that gay marriages are still not recognized in more than 80 percent of the states. John Eastman, chairman of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes gay marriage, noted that the Supreme Court's decision to accept the cases sends \"a strong signal that the justices are concerned with the rogue rulings that have come out of San Francisco.\"\n\nOral arguments for the cases are expected to be held in late winter or early spring, with decisions issued by summer. The high court proceedings are likely to take on new urgency given the activity in states such as Washington, where same-sex couples have been able to marry since Thursday.\n\nThe federal case was brought by the ACLU and other lawyers on behalf of Edith Windsor, a New York woman who married her longtime companion, Thea Spyer, in Canada in 2007. When Ms. Spyer died a few years later, their marriage was not recognized by the federal government because of DOMA, and Ms. Windsor, now 83, was forced to pay nearly $370,000 in federal estate taxes.\n\nThe Proposition 8 case asks whether the U.S. Constitution prohibits the people of California from defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman in their state. The American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER) sued to overturn Proposition 8 on behalf of two same-sex couples.\n\n\"This case is about the fundamental constitutional right of all Americans to marry the person they love,\" said Theodore B. Olson, AFER's lead co-counsel with David Boies. The Supreme Court's decision to grant review in this case \"illustrates the national significance of marriage equality, and brings us closer to the day when every American will be able to equally enjoy the fundamental freedom to marry.\"\n\nAndy Pugno, general counsel for ProtectMarriage.com, the organization that put Proposition 8 on the ballot, said, \"Arguing this case before the Supreme Court finally gives us a chance at a fair hearing, something that hasn't been afforded to the people since we began this fight.\"\n\nThis story is based in part on wire service reports.",
    " Title: Republican Governors Shift Focus Away from Tax Cuts and Towards Infrastructure and Healthcare\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of the 2010 elections, Republican governors across the nation, led by Wisconsin's Scott Walker, made significant strides in implementing conservative policies, including limiting public-employee collective bargaining and enacting tax cuts. However, as the 2016 election approaches, a different narrative is emerging.\n\nCurrently, it appears that no Republican governor is poised to replicate Scott Walker's 2010 success. Walker himself has distanced himself from the idea of a right-to-work bill, viewing it as a potential distraction amidst Wisconsin's $2.2 billion budget gap over two years.\n\nIn Ohio, Governor John Kasich, another potential presidential candidate, is advocating for increased taxes on energy drilling companies to fund an income tax cut, despite opposition from a Tea Party faction in the General Assembly. Michigan's Governor Rick Snyder, who overcame conservative objections to financial aid for Detroit, is proposing higher gasoline taxes to improve roads, an idea that is unpopular on his right.\n\nThe prospect of sweeping new tax cuts, a cornerstone of Republican orthodoxy, seems to have diminished. This shift is partly due to incumbents who have already enacted cuts, but it also appears to be a response to the cautionary example of Kansas.\n\nIn Kansas, Governor Sam Brownback implemented large business and income tax cuts in 2012 and 2013, promising that the loss of revenue would be compensated by a business boom. Instead, revenues plummeted, the state faces a significant budget shortfall, and Brownback, a Republican, nearly lost re-election due to a backlash.\n\nIn Florida, Governor Rick Scott, who was sworn in on Tuesday, has outlined an agenda that includes increased spending on schools, the environment, and transportation - a stark contrast to the $3.3 billion in education cuts during his first term, as well as his rejection of billions in federal aid for high-speed rail.\n\nIn Arizona, the newly elected Republican governor, Doug Ducey, pledged in his inauguration speech not to raise taxes but omitted mention of his campaign promises to cut income taxes annually. This omission was not surprising, given that the state faces a substantial and growing budget deficit.\n\nSeveral Republican governors, including Tennessee's Bill Haslam and those in Wyoming and North Carolina, have expressed support for some form of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, arguing that accepting the billions of dollars in federal aid is a fiscally smart move.\n\nThis shift in focus from tax cuts to infrastructure and healthcare suggests a more pragmatic approach from Republican governors, as they navigate the complexities of their states' budgets and the lessons learned from the experiences of their colleagues in Kansas and other states.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Affirms No Contact from FBI in Email Investigation, Remains Confident About Debate with Bernie Sanders\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton stated that she has not received contact from the FBI in the ongoing investigation regarding her use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State.\n\nWhen asked if FBI agents had reached out to her, Clinton responded, \"No, no, they haven't.\" She added, \"Back in August, we made clear that I'm happy to answer any questions that anybody might have. And I stand by that.\"\n\nClinton expressed no concern that the investigation may not be concluded by the time the Democratic National Convention takes place in July. \"No, I'm not,\" she told moderator Chuck Todd. \"Because I do not think anything inappropriate was done. And so I have to let them decide how to resolve their security inquiry, but I'm not at all worried about it.\"\n\nClinton reiterated that sending emails from a private server while serving as Secretary of State was a mistake. \"So let me just say again, I sent emails to government employees on their government accounts,\" Clinton said. \"I had every reason to believe they were in the government system. It was a matter of convenience. I've said repeatedly, it was not the best choice. It was a mistake. But I think that anybody who's actually looked at this has concluded that I have now put out all of my emails. Go and ask others for their emails. Ask everybody else who's in public office. I'm the one who's done it, and I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nIn addition, Clinton expressed confidence that she will debate her Democratic rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, before the New York primary on April 19, but would not commit to a specific date. \"I'm not the one negotiating it, that's going on between our campaigns,\" Clinton said.\n\nSanders has been pushing for a debate with Clinton. Sanders, a native of Brooklyn, believes he has a chance to win New York, while Clinton, a New York resident and former U.S. senator from the state, expects to carry the Empire State.\n\nSanders also expressed confidence that there will be a debate before the primary, stating on ABC's This Week on Sunday that he is \"looking forward to debating Secretary Clinton.\"",
    " Title: \"St. Paul Police Incident: Charges Dropped Against Christopher Lollie Following Alleged Misconduct\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, a video surfaced this week capturing an alleged instance of police misconduct in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota. The video, which has since gone viral, depicts a confrontation between a police officer and 28-year-old Christopher Lollie, who was waiting to pick up his children from New Horizon Academy.\n\nThe video begins with a female officer approaching Lollie, asking him to identify himself. Lollie, who was sitting in a public area for approximately 10 minutes, expresses his confusion and refusal to comply, stating that he had not broken any laws.\n\n\"The problem is I'm black,\" Lollie interjects. \"It really is, because I'm not sitting there with a group of people. I'm sitting there by myself, not causing a problem.\"\n\nA second officer then approaches the pair, and an attempt is made to touch Lollie. Lollie, growing increasingly upset, states, \"I've got to go get my kids. Please don't touch me.\" The second officer responds, \"You're going to go to jail then.\"\n\nThe situation escalates, with Lollie being cuffed, a taser being charged, and Lollie's subsequent screams heard in the video. The police report, obtained by local media, states that two officers, Michael Johnson and Bruce Schmidt, were called to the First National Bank Building \"on a report of an uncooperative male refusing to leave.\" The female officer involved in the incident has not yet been identified.\n\nLollie, who had been attending New Horizon for about 9 months at the time, said his children were not present during the incident. However, his children's classmates and teacher witnessed the event. The teacher provided a witness statement, stating that Lollie was calm, not causing a problem, and was speaking with them before the officers allegedly assaulted him.\n\nSince the incident, Lollie has fought the charges, and all charges against him were dropped as of July 31, according to Lollie. He stated that he chose not to release the video until the charges were dropped.\n\n\"It hurts,\" Lollie said. \"Because no matter what\u2014I could be the nicest guy in the world, talk with respect, I can be working, taking care of my kids, doing everything the model citizen is supposed to do\u2014and I still get that type of treatment.\"\n\nThe St. Paul Police Department has not yet released a statement regarding the incident or the actions of the officers involved. Lollie's attorney, Nate Madden, has stated that they are considering a lawsuit against the police department.",
    " Title: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Defends Employee's Freedom of Speech Amidst Cancellation of Preseason Games in China\n\nTOKYO (AP) \u2014 NBA Commissioner Adam Silver defended Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's freedom of speech, despite China's state broadcaster canceling plans to show two preseason games later this week, following Morey's tweet supporting anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at a news conference in Tokyo before a preseason game between the Rockets and NBA champion Toronto Raptors, Silver stated, \"Daryl Morey, as general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right as one of our employees.\"\n\nSilver further explained, \"What I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.\"\n\nThe cancellation of the games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets, which were scheduled to take place in Shanghai and Shenzhen, was one of the consequences. Basketball is popular in China, and the two teams, particularly the Lakers due to LeBron James' stardom and the Nets due to Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's co-founder Joe Tsai's ownership, would have likely drawn a significant television audience.\n\nCCTV, China's state broadcaster, issued a statement saying, \"We are strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver's claim to support Morey's right to freedom of expression.\" The broadcaster also stated it is reviewing all its cooperation and exchanges involving the NBA.\n\nThe NBA is not the first major corporation to face criticism from China over political differences. Other companies, such as Mercedes-Benz, Delta Air Lines, hotel operator Marriott, fashion brand Zara, and others, have also encountered conflicts with China in recent years.\n\nSilver is scheduled to visit Shanghai on Wednesday and hopes to meet with officials and some of the league's business partners there in an effort to find common ground. He expressed hope that Chinese officials and fans would consider the long-standing relationship between the league and China and understand his response while acknowledging political differences between the countries.\n\nSilver stated, \"I'm sympathetic to our interests here and our partners that are upset. I don't think it's inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.\"\n\nThe rift between China and the NBA began last week when Morey tweeted a now-deleted image that read, \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\" in reference to months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.\n\nEfforts to defuse the situation were made, with Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta stating Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and Morey returning to Twitter on Monday to clarify his statement. However, the damage was already done, with at least one Chinese sporting goods company ending cooperation with the Rockets, NBA streaming partner Tencent stating it would not show Rockets games, and a sports news website in China stating it was no longer covering the team.\n\nFurther complicating the matter is the fact that China's best-known basketball player, Hall of Famer Yao Ming, spent his NBA career with the Rockets. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which has suspended its relationship with the Rockets in response to Morey's tweet. The CBA also canceled plans for Houston and Dallas G League affiliates to play preseason games in China later this month.\n\nSilver expressed hope for reconciliation, stating, \"I'm hoping that together Yao Ming and I can find an accommodation. But he is extremely hot at the moment, and I understand it.\"\n\nAn NBA Cares event for a Shanghai educational center with the Nets was canceled Tuesday, though the Nets participated in other events as scheduled. The Lakers were due to arrive in Shanghai Tuesday. NBA Cares will still honor its larger mission surrounding the event, including providing a gift of new computers.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang stated Tuesday, \"NBA's cooperation with China has been going on for quite a long time, so for what should be said and what should be done, they know best.\"\n\nSilver also released a statement before his news conference, stating, \"Those who question our motivation should know that the NBA's stance is about more than business.\" Many U.S. lawmakers have called for the league to take action, with some suggesting the games in China should be canceled by the NBA.\n\nSilver concluded, \"We are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression. I regret\u2014again, having communicated directly with many friends in China\u2014that so many people are upset, including millions and millions of our fans. At the end of the day, we come with basketball as an opportunity to sell dreams, sell hopes... that we are causing disruption in people's lives and that we are causing disharmony, that's something I regret.\"",
    " Title: Controversial Remarks by Obamacare Architect Jonathan Gruber Raise Questions for Democrats Ahead of Supreme Court Review\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of controversial remarks made by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Jonathan Gruber, who was a key architect of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), Democrats are facing questions about his role in their defense strategy as they prepare for another Supreme Court review of the health care law.\n\nGruber's comments, which surfaced recently, have caused a stir as he admitted to manipulating the language of the bill to avoid the Congressional Budget Office scoring the individual mandate as a tax, even though the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately upheld the mandate as constitutional under Congress' taxing power.\n\nIn his comments, Gruber stated, \"Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage... That was really, really critical to get the thing to pass.\" He also referred to American voters as \"stupid\" and suggested that their lack of understanding was crucial to the bill's passage.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who had previously cited Gruber in a 2009 \"myth buster\" post, distanced herself from him this week, stating, \"I don't know who he is. He didn't help write our bill.\" However, she added that Gruber's comments were a year old and he had recanted them.\n\nGruber has since expressed regret for his remarks, but House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, stated that American voters are \"anything but stupid\" and oppose the health care system's overhaul for valid reasons.\n\nGruber's explanation in 2012 of how Obamacare's subsidies should be paid has also caused problems for the Obama administration. In legal briefs submitted last year to a federal district court in Virginia, administration attorneys cited Gruber in a case defending their ability to pay subsidies to enrollees regardless of whether they are part of state-run or federally run health care exchanges.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided this month to take up the case, King v. Burwell, after the challengers lost to the administration in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Neither the Justice Department nor the White House responded to questions about Gruber and his role in their legal strategy.\n\nSam Kazman, general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which is funding the administration's opponents in the King case, stated that Gruber's 2012 remarks about subsidies bolster their own arguments. Gruber at the time said subsidies would flow only to states that set up their own exchanges, which would mean consumers in most states wouldn't be eligible for subsidies, potentially puncturing a big hole in Obamacare.\n\nIn a parallel case before the D.C. Circuit, the administration tried to downplay Gruber in its latest court filings. On Nov. 3, the Justice Department stated in a footnote that \"post-enactment statements by a non-legislator are entitled to no weight.\"\n\nIn the King case, Obama administration attorneys who cited Gruber in briefs at the lower court dropped him from their arguments to the Supreme Court, said Michael A. Carvin, an attorney for the health care law's opponents.\n\nGruber has made hundreds of thousands of dollars off Obamacare, serving as a consultant to the Department of Health and Human Services and to states that used health care grant money to pay him for his services.\n\nTimothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University who closely tracks the health care law, stated that the controversy has been overblown. \"He wasn't a legislator. He didn't write the bill. He didn't vote on the bill,\" Jost said.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Proposed Rule on Short-Term Health Insurance Plans: Urban Institute Report Highlights Gains and Reduced Costs for Taxpayers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration's proposed rule to ease the availability of short-term, limited duration (STLD) health insurance plans could lead to an increase of 1.7 million Americans being insured while reducing costs to taxpayers, according to a new report from the Urban Institute.\n\nOn February 20, the Trump administration released a proposed rule that aims to make it easier for Americans to access affordable health insurance options outside of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) health-insurance exchanges. The rule would repeal an October 2016 regulation that restricted the availability of STLD plans, which can be purchased for around $124 per month, compared to $393 on the exchanges.\n\nThe report, titled \"The Impact of Short-Term Limited Duration Insurance and the Individual Mandate on Health Insurance Markets and the ACA's Subsidy Program,\" provides a clear picture of the potential benefits of the policy. The report's executive summary highlights several statistics, but it is the findings in the report's Table 1 that offer the most insight.\n\nAccording to Table 1, 7.4 million on the exchanges eligible for tax credits would see no change in premiums. Furthermore, 4.2 million would enroll in STLD plans, whose premiums would be far below those for plans currently available (STLD premiums in the fourth quarter of 2016 were 68.4 percent lower than those on the exchanges).\n\nAdditionally, 4.5 million on the exchanges without tax credits would see premiums rise somewhat (by an average of 18.2 percent, compared with 8.3 percent in states prohibiting STLD plans, according to Table 4 on page 16).\n\nWhile there are roughly similar numbers of winners and losers, the scale of benefits far exceeds the costs. The modest premium increases would be felt only by unsubsidized high-income enrollees, but the savings would be enjoyed across the income distribution\u2014including by large numbers of low- and moderate-income households.\n\nThe Urban Institute also estimates that Trump's proposal would reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 1.7 million\u2014a finding the report buries by grouping those enrolled in STLD plans together with the truly uninsured. In other words, restricting the sale of attractive, affordably priced health insurance isn't necessary to forestall the collapse of the exchanges, but it has needlessly concentrated enormous costs on millions seeking health insurance and forced many to go entirely without.\n\nThe Urban Institute's study is also enlightening with respect to the net fiscal impact of STLD deregulation. As a cheaper alternative to the exchanges becomes available, low-risk subsidized individuals may disenroll, and hence the government may save money. However, as the risk pool on the exchanges becomes sicker, subsidies expand, costing the government money. The net impact of these effects has as yet been unclear.\n\nThe Urban Institute finds that the number of people on unsubsidized ACA-compliant plans would fall by 1.5 million, while the number on subsidized plans would fall by 600,000. As a result, the reform would slightly reduce federal spending on health care for the nonelderly\u2014by $686 million, or 0.2 percent\u2014and should allay whatever federal budgetary concerns may have impeded the proposal's more thorough implementation.\n\nThese empirical findings (from authors who had expressed opposition to STLD insurance) suggest that the deregulation of STLD plans overall substantially reduces the cost of health insurance, covers more people, and slightly reduces the burden on taxpayers. States should embrace it\u2014and give their residents a real chance to purchase affordable insurance coverage for themselves and their families.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Lifts Ban on Lawsuits Against Foreign Companies Over Confiscated Cuban Properties\n\nWASHINGTON/HAVANA - The Trump administration will allow lawsuits in U.S. courts for the first time against foreign companies that use properties confiscated by the Cuban government since Fidel Castro's revolution six decades ago, a senior U.S. official announced on Tuesday. The policy shift, to be announced on Wednesday, could expose U.S., European, and Canadian companies to legal action and potentially harm Cuba's efforts to attract foreign investment.\n\nThe decision, which will be explained in a speech by President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, on Wednesday, also signals Washington's efforts to punish Havana over its support for Venezuela's socialist president, Nicolas Maduro. The administration will also announce new sanctions on Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, countries Bolton has branded a \"troika of tyranny.\"\n\nIt remains unclear whether such property claims will be accepted in U.S. courts, with the European Union already warning it could lodge a challenge with the World Trade Organization. EU ambassador to Cuba, Alberto Navarro, stated in Havana that the extraterritorial application of the U.S. embargo is illegal, contrary to international law, and immoral.\n\nPresident Trump had previously threatened in January to allow a law that has been suspended since its creation in 1996, permitting Cuban-Americans and other U.S. citizens to sue foreign companies doing business in Cuba over property seized in decades past by the Cuban government. Title III of the Helms-Burton Act had been fully waived by every president over the past 23 years due to opposition from the international community and fears it could create chaos in the U.S. court system with a flood of lawsuits.\n\nThe complete lifting of the ban could allow billions of dollars in legal claims to move forward in U.S. courts and likely antagonize Canada and Europe, whose companies have significant business holdings in Cuba. It could also affect some U.S. companies that began investing in the island since former President Barack Obama began a process of normalizing relations between the two countries from the end of 2014.\n\nThe Cuban government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, the country's National Assembly, meeting over the weekend, declared the Helms-Burton Act \"illegitimate, unenforceable, and without legal effect.\" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel stated in a speech on Saturday that the United States \"has pushed the precarious relations with our country back to the worst level... trying to activate the hateful Helms-Burton Law, which aims to return us in principle to... when we were a slave nation of another empire.\"\n\nU.S.-Cuban relations have deteriorated since Trump became president in early 2017. A six-decade U.S. economic embargo on Cuba has also remained officially intact. Trump is going ahead despite protests by Canadian and European leaders to U.S. counterparts.\n\nThe U.S. official dismissed the EU's warning of a possible WTO challenge and a cycle of counterclaims in European courts as doomed to fail. Among the foreign companies heavily invested in Cuba are Canadian mining firm Sherritt International Corp and Spain's Melia Hotels International SA. U.S. companies, including airlines and cruise companies, have forged business deals in Cuba since the easing of restrictions under Obama.\n\nDefending the decision, the U.S. official said allowing lawsuits would cause only a \"bump\" in the business world but send a message of U.S. resolve against Havana. In addition to halting any further waivers of Title III, the administration will begin full enforcement of Helms-Burton's Title IV, which requires the denial of U.S. visas to those involved in \"trafficking\" confiscated properties in Cuba.\n\nTrump's decision followed threats by his top aides in recent weeks to take actions against Cuba to force it to abandon Maduro, something Havana has insisted it will not do. Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido invoked the constitution in January to assume the interim presidency. The United States and most Western countries have backed Guaido as head of state. Maduro has denounced Guaido as a U.S. puppet who is seeking to foment a coup, and Maduro is backed by Cuba, Russia, China, and the Venezuela military.\n\nTrump's toughened stance on Cuba, as well as Venezuela, has been well-received in the large Cuban-American community in south Florida, an important voting bloc in a political swing state as he looks toward his re-election campaign in 2020. In Bolton's speech on Wednesday, he is expected to announce further measures against Cuba. The administration is considering a range of options, including sanctions against senior Cuban military and intelligence officials over their role in Venezuela and the tightening of limits on U.S. trade with the island, according to two people familiar with the matter. Navarro stated that EU companies had the obligation not to collaborate with U.S. judgments under Title III and the possibility to make counterclaims.\n\nJames Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a Washington-based lobbying group working to normalize relations with Cuba, stated that the policy decision has not been tested legally. Some 5,913 claims held by U.S. companies and individuals have been certified by the U.S. Justice Department and are estimated to be worth roughly $8 billion. Cuban law ties settlement of any claims to U.S. reparations for damages from Washington's embargo and what it considers other acts of U.S. aggression. Cuban estimates of that damage range from $121 billion to more than $300 billion.",
    " Title: Conservative Groups and Fiscal Hawks Criticize Bipartisan Budget Agreement, Speaker Boehner Defends Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the bipartisan budget agreement negotiated between House Republicans and Senate Democrats has faced strong criticism from conservative groups and fiscal hawks, with House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, facing an unusually harsh response. The deal, struck a day earlier by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, has been met with mixed reactions, with some sectors of the economy set to benefit while others face potential losses.\n\nThe agreement, which could be voted on in the House as early as Thursday, has been criticized for its perceived failure to address long-term spending on entitlement programs and for permitting new spending in the short term in exchange for vague promises of long-term cuts.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, expressed his opposition, stating, \"I am against [the deal] from just a basic point that we embarked on a position at the beginning of the year that said, 'We will keep the sequester in place unless we get to make changes on mandatory spending that will save those programs and put the budget on a path to balance within the next 10 years.'\"\n\nChris Chocola, president of the fiscally hawkish Club for Growth, added, \"Apparently, there are some Republicans who don't have the stomach for even relatively small spending reductions that are devoid of budgetary smoke and mirrors. If Republicans work with Democrats to pass this deal, it should surprise no one when Republican voters seek alternatives who actually believe in less spending when they go to the ballot box.\"\n\nDespite the conservative backlash and tepid reviews from many House Democrats, Speaker Boehner defended the agreement, using strong language to counter the criticism. \"They're using our members and the American people to their own purposes,\" an angry Mr. Boehner said. \"This is ridiculous.\"\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bulk of the plan's deficit reduction would come in the final three years of the deal, while the new spending would occur over the next two years. The estimate followed news that the U.S. government ran a $135.2 billion budget deficit through the first two months of the year, a significant decrease from the $226.8 billion deficit of the same period last year.\n\nThe Ryan-Murray agreement increases spending in 2014 to $1.012 trillion and in 2015 to $1.014 trillion, restoring more than $60 billion in sequester spending cuts. The new spending is offset in part by lowering the cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees, requiring higher pension contributions from recently hired federal employees, and raising fees on travelers collected by the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nIndustries and interests that emerged as losers in the final deal, such as the airline industry and federal employees, have already expressed their displeasure. The National Treasury Employees Union and National Nurses United have voiced concerns about the impact on federal workers and military retirees, respectively.\n\nMany liberal lawmakers have also criticized the agreement, arguing that it unfairly burdens federal workers and may face difficulties passing if it does not extend unemployment insurance for the 1.3 million Americans set to be kicked off the rolls before the end of the year.\n\nAs the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether the bipartisan budget agreement will pass, and if so, with what amendments or concessions.",
    " Title: \"Ahmad Khan Rahami Captured in Shootout with Police, Charged with Attempted Murder of Officers\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Ahmad Khan Rahami, the primary suspect in the bombings in New Jersey and New York over the weekend, was captured Monday following a gun battle with police in Linden, New Jersey. The 28-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen was identified as the main person of interest in the Saturday night blast in New York's Chelsea neighborhood, an explosion in New Jersey's Seaside Park on Saturday morning, and a foiled bomb attack Sunday night near a train station in Elizabeth, NJ.\n\nThe manhunt for Rahami began Monday morning after a bar owner in Linden spotted him sleeping in his doorway. A police officer confronted Rahami around 10:45 a.m., and a gun battle ensued. The officer, identified as Angel Padilla, was shot in the abdomen, but was wearing a bulletproof vest. A second officer, Investigator Pete Hammer, was grazed by a bullet. Both officers are expected to recover.\n\nRahami was shot at least once in the leg and was eventually subdued and taken into custody. He was charged with five counts of attempted murder of a police officer and was being held on $5.2 million bail. Rahami underwent surgery at University Hospital in Newark and remained at the hospital. It was not known if Rahami had an attorney as of Monday evening.\n\nFederal charges in the bombings have yet to be filed. Rahami was last known to have lived in Elizabeth, where the FBI conducted a raid on his apartment Monday morning. The city is also where investigators discovered five suspicious devices, one of which exploded while a bomb squad robot tried to disarm it, near a train station on Sunday night.\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo suggested during a Monday interview that the bomb plot may have been influenced by foreign sources. Two U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday that the bomb plot likely involved several individuals. Federal authorities conducted a traffic stop in Brooklyn of a \"vehicle of interest\" in the bombings on Sunday night. The individuals in the vehicle were no longer in custody, the FBI said Monday.\n\nThe Chelsea bombing, which injured 29 people, occurred on West 23rd Street at 8:30 p.m. on Saturday. Police found a second, unexploded device four blocks away. The device was described as a pressure cooker with wires and a phone attached. The contraption bore a resemblance to the bomb used in the 2013 Boston Marathon attack and was placed in a plastic bag.\n\nAuthorities found Rahami's fingerprint on the unexploded bomb discovered on West 27th Street. Police are still searching for two individuals who allegedly removed the bomb from a duffle bag after it had been placed on the street by Rahami. The pair placed the device in a plastic bag and then walked off with the duffel bag. Police consider the individuals witnesses.\n\nThe pipe bomb explosion in Seaside Park occurred about 80 miles south of the Chelsea bombing site. No one was injured in that blast. Runners were slated to be near the location of the explosion when it went off, but the race was delayed after an unattended backpack was discovered.\n\nLocal and federal officials said Rahami had not been on law enforcement's radar before the explosions, and the FBI said they had no knowledge of Rahami receiving any weapons or explosives training overseas.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg Face Off in CNN Town Hall, Sanders Criticizes Bloomberg's Wealth but Declines to Address Accepting Potential Funding\n\nIn a heated exchange during a CNN town hall on Tuesday night, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders criticized fellow candidate Michael Bloomberg's wealth, stating that it was \"offensive\" for a candidate to \"buy the presidency.\" Sanders, however, declined to indicate whether he would accept financial help from Bloomberg to beat President Donald Trump.\n\nDuring the town hall, Anderson Cooper asked Sanders if he considered Bloomberg his closest competition for the Democratic nomination. Sanders responded, \"I don't think he has the right to buy this election... I think it's a bit obscene that we have somebody who... I'll buy the presidency.\"\n\nLater in the event, an audience member asked Sanders if he would accept help from billionaires like Bloomberg if he were nominated. Sanders dodged the question three times about whether he would accept Michael Bloomberg's money in the general election.\n\nSanders emphasized his grassroots campaign, stating that he has received more campaign contributions from more Americans than any candidate in the history of the United States. He also reiterated his commitment to defeating President Trump.\n\nCooper pressed Sanders on the issue, asking if Sanders would accept money from Bloomberg if he did not win the nomination. Sanders responded that he would support the Democratic nominee, but declined to answer directly whether he would accept Bloomberg's money if he did not win the nomination.\n\nThe exchange between Sanders and Bloomberg is the latest in a series of heated exchanges between the two candidates. The primary season is heating up, and the race to take on President Trump in the general election is intensifying.",
    " Title: House Republicans Propose Transitional Plan to Address Potential Obamacare Subsidy Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address the potential fallout from a forthcoming Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), House Republicans have outlined a plan to maintain subsidies for Obamacare beneficiaries while allowing states to opt out of the program. The plan, described as a \"work in progress,\" would continue to provide full subsidies under the ACA to all beneficiaries regardless of their state of residence, but starting in 2016, states could begin to opt out, receiving block grants to manage their residents' health insurance as they see fit.\n\nThe block grants and subsidies, including those for states that remain in the ACA, would expire in 2017, leaving the next president and Congress with the task of replacing the law entirely. Representative Charles W. Boustany Jr. (R-LA) praised the plan, stating, \"I think it's a good plan. It's a good start.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently considering a part of the law that stipulates subsidies can be paid to residents in states with their own exchanges. The administration argues this was intended to cover everyone, while opponents claim it was meant to exclude the 34 states that did not establish their own exchanges and instead rely on the federal HealthCare.gov program. More than 6 million Americans could lose subsidies if the court rules against the administration.\n\nSenate Republicans are also discussing their own plans, including extending subsidies through 2017 and allowing states to opt out of the ACA. Senate Republicans have co-sponsored a bill by Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) that would lock in the subsidies through August 2017.\n\nPresident Obama and his Democratic allies argue the law is fine as it stands, and that all Americans should receive subsidies. They contend that if the court rules against the administration, Congress should pass a one-sentence change to clarify that subsidies should be available to everyone. However, the GOP-led Congress is unlikely to support this approach.\n\nThe House proposal, which is still in development, would repeal the ACA's insurance mandates for individuals and employers, a move that is likely to draw criticism from ACA supporters who argue these mandates are necessary to balance risk pools and keep premiums in check. The plan would be passed using a budget process known as \"reconciliation,\" which can pass the Senate with a majority vote, but could still be vetoed by President Obama.\n\nSome lawmakers are hesitant to extend Obamacare subsidies beyond 2015 and 2016, fearing it sends the wrong message to voters after the GOP has spent years trying to repeal the entire law. The House plan is still in development, and the fractious House GOP caucus has struggled to agree on many issues in the past.",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry Cautions on Iran Nuclear Deal Amid Allegations of Secret Uranium Enrichment Facility\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry has expressed concerns about a potential derailment of the ongoing nuclear deal negotiations with Iran, following allegations from an Iranian dissident group that Iran is operating a secret uranium enrichment facility near Tehran.\n\nDuring a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Wednesday, Kerry stated that U.S. officials were aware of the site prior to this week, but it has not been identified as a nuclear facility. He emphasized, \"It is a facility that we are well aware of, which is on a list of facilities we have. I\u2019m not going to go into greater detail.\"\n\nThe alleged facility, known as \"Lavizan-3,\" is said to have been used for clandestine nuclear research since 2008 and for uranium enrichment with advanced IR-2m and IR-4 centrifuge machines, according to the National Coalition of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), a dissident group that claims the site has never before been revealed to international officials.\n\nThe NCRI's claim is not yet verifiable, and the group has a controversial history in Washington. However, the group is known for having deep sources inside Iran's nuclear community and is credited with having made game-changing revelations about Tehran's activities in the past.\n\nNotably, during the early 2000s, similar NCRI claims exposed the existence of Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment facility and the Arak heavy-water plutonium facility\u2014two operations that have been at the center of international scrutiny and distrust of Tehran since then.\n\nRep. Brad Sherman (D-California) noted to Kerry during the hearing that \"the MEK sometimes gives us accurate information.\" Sherman added, \"They are the ones that told the world about the Iranian nuclear program. They now say that there\u2019s a secret facility at Lavazza 3.\"\n\nThe development comes as the U.S. and Iran are in the final stages of negotiations to reach a comprehensive nuclear deal, with a deadline of November 24, 2014. The allegations of a secret uranium enrichment facility could potentially complicate the ongoing negotiations and raise further concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions.",
    " Title: Comparative Analysis: South Korea's Response to COVID-19 vs. China's Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, two contrasting approaches have emerged, with South Korea and China representing opposite ends of the spectrum. While China's Communist Party has claimed its response as a testament to its political prowess, a closer look at the situation reveals a more complex reality.\n\nSouth Korea, a democracy, has demonstrated a more open and transparent approach, focusing on education, transparency, and mobilizing civil society. This strategy, devoid of China's tactics such as forced home detention, use of minorities as slave labor, or silencing critics, has resulted in a more manageable outbreak.\n\nSouth Korea's most effective weapon against the virus has been its rapid expansion of testing. The country is currently testing 15,000 people daily, according to government figures, with 210,000 South Koreans tested since January 3, compared to approximately 6,500 tests completed in the United States by Tuesday morning. Despite the spike in confirmed cases, South Korea's mortality rate stands at 0.71 percent, with only 54 deaths reported as of Tuesday.\n\nThe number of daily confirmed cases has been steadily declining, from 686 on March 2 to just 131 on Tuesday, according to government figures. The government has deployed 53 drive-through sample collection stations, ensuring physical distancing during testing.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in acknowledged the gravity of the situation on March 1, raising the crisis alert to the highest level. South Korea's civil society has also played a significant role, with major events canceled, church services moved online, and citizens voluntarily avoiding areas with high infection rates, such as Daegu, without resorting to lockdowns.\n\nControversial measures, such as tracking confirmed cases via GPS, have been implemented, but they pale in comparison to the surveillance tactics used in some parts of China, such as drones taking people's temperatures and spraying disinfectant.\n\nTo prevent the export of the virus, South Korea has implemented a three-step detection system at Incheon International Airport, with additional screening measures for passengers bound for the United States. This approach emphasizes transparency and openness, rather than China's pattern of distortion and distraction.\n\nWhile China deserves credit for its scientific attention to the problem, as acknowledged in a World Health Organization (WHO) report, the report also highlights the deep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action in the face of the common threat. If Beijing had practiced openness, transparency, and public education earlier, the epidemic might not have reached such devastating proportions.\n\nIn conclusion, South Korea's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, characterized by openness, transparency, and the active participation of its citizens, offers a stark contrast to China's more authoritarian approach. This approach not only appears to be more effective in managing the outbreak but also aligns with democratic values, ensuring dignity, and entrusting citizens with truth. The success of South Korea's response, both in terms of public health and politics, serves as a reminder of the strength of democratic values in times of crisis.",
    " Title: FBI Interview Summaries Suggest Alleged Email Classification Deal Between State Department and Clinton Aides\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), it has been suggested that there was an attempt at a deal between Patrick Kennedy, a high-ranking official at the State Department, and the FBI, where classified emails on Hillary Clinton's unsecured bathroom server would have their status altered in exchange for more favorable treatment of FBI officials in overseas postings at embassies.\n\nAccording to documents made public by the FBI as part of interview summaries surrounding the Clinton emails case, the negotiations took place in the spring of 2015. The Weekly Standard's Stephen Hayes first broke the story on Friday.\n\nThe FBI interviews reveal that a senior FBI official in the international operations division described conversations with Kennedy about the classification of emails. In his interview, this official stated that his section of the FBI had attempted to contact Kennedy repeatedly over several months but received no response. In the late spring or early summer of 2015, the FBI official reported to work to find a note indicating that Kennedy had called. According to the summary, Kennedy wanted help.\n\nThe FBI official spoke with Kennedy, and Kennedy raised the possibility of keeping at least one Clinton email from public disclosure by obtaining a \"B9\" exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, a rarely used exemption that refers to \"geological and geophysical information and data.\" One email in particular concerned Kennedy, and according to the FBI summary, providing a B9 exemption \"would allow him to archive the document in the basement of the department of state never to be seen again.\" The FBI official told Kennedy that he would look into the email if Kennedy would authorize a pending request for additional FBI personnel in Iraq.\n\nFurther evidence of Kennedy's attempts to have the classification of some sensitive emails changed comes from a summary of an interview with the section chief of the FBI records management division. The FBI records official, whose job includes making determinations on classification, told investigators that he was approached by his colleague in international operations after the initial discussion with Kennedy. The FBI records official says that his colleague \"pressured\" him to declassify an email \"in exchange for a quid pro quo,\" according to the interview summary. \"In exchange for making the email unclassified, State would reciprocate by allowing the FBI to place more agents in countries where they are presently forbidden.\" The request was denied.\n\nThe FBI has \"explained\" these events by saying that the bargained-for exchange never took place, and the FBI agent with whom Kennedy was communicating has since retired. State Department spokesman Mark Toner made the absurd claim that these conversations were a \"normal part of the classification process\" \u2014 as though it's \"normal\" to reclassify documents that are part of an investigation into criminal misuse of state secrets in favor of the governing party's presidential nominee.\n\nThis communication took place amid Hillary Clinton's denials that any classified material was sent or received on her email, which her former employees still working at State \u2014 including Kennedy \u2014 knew to be a lie. And rather than give the public the truth, which wouldn't come out until much later, after she had won the Democrat nomination, Kennedy was working to remedy her false denials by making a lie true.\n\nFurthermore, he was offering essentially a bribe to the FBI in order to procure more favorable field on which the Clinton email investigation would play out. This isn't some ho-hum bureaucratic deal-making at work \u2014 or if it is, it illuminates precisely how like the Third World the corruption in Washington has become.\n\nConsider what would happen if the middle manager or legal counsel at XYZ Corporation, whose CEO is under FBI investigation, were to offer perks and valuables to FBI agents individually or collectively as a quid pro quo for a reframing of the investigation. We all know how that would go \u2014 the charges would pile up, the offender in question would be quickly dismissed, the corporation would be dragged through the mud, and the CEO would be accused of directing the attempted bribe.\n\nIn this case, there is no evidence Hillary Clinton was behind Kennedy's offers \u2014 but we also don't know how hard investigators have looked. After all, this horse-trading didn't happen when Hillary was wrapping up her affairs at State in 2012; it happened last year when the FBI investigation was ramping up. One assumes Kennedy understood the stakes at hand, and one assumes he's smart enough to know how best to butter his own bread as a Clintonite.\n\nAnd given Kennedy's role as the Clintons' fixer at State, you would expect that he would be the primary individual put to the squeeze in any investigation of the email scandal. Kennedy, after all, was involved in the questionable political hiring of Clinton IT tech Bryan Pagliano to a nonpolitical State Department job; Pagliano was the man who set up Hillary's private server and ended up getting immunity in the investigation.\n\nBut yes, Toner and the rest of the Democrat stooges disguised as federal bureaucrats are correct. For those of us rubes in the hinterlands, this might seem a flagrant example of an out-of-control government, but for our betters inside the Beltway, it's a Tuesday. And they wonder why we increasingly recoil from consent to be governed by them.",
    " Title: Raheem Kassam, Donald Trump Jr., and the Ongoing Debate on Social Media Censorship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Raheem Kassam, a former editor for Breitbart and a fellow at the Claremont Institute, expressed his belief that the Left is attempting to silence conservative voices on social media. Kassam's recent suspension from Facebook, which was later restored, has sparked a conversation about online censorship and the suppression of free speech.\n\nKassam, who is the author of \"No Go Zones: How Sharia Law Is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You,\" sees the social-media crackdown on conservatives as evidence of the Left's fear. \"If the other side wasn't afraid, they wouldn't be coming down so heavy-handed on people,\" Kassam said. He also predicted that if President Trump is re-elected in 2021, there will be a push for a Digital Bill of Rights to address the issue of online free speech.\n\nThe suppression of online free speech has been a topic of concern for many conservatives, with instances of censorship becoming increasingly common on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. In February, Instagram (owned by Facebook) deleted a post by Donald Trump Jr., which led to a backlash from the president's son. Trump Jr. was livid in his reaction, stating, \"You're part of the problem. Maybe allow for discourse rather than force feed everyone your leftist bulls**t.\"\n\nThe issue of online censorship has been a contentious one, with many conservatives feeling that their voices are being silenced while the Left's narrative is being amplified. In 2016, the suspension of Stacy McCain's Twitter account, which had tens of thousands of followers, was met with outrage. Twitter offered no details of what McCain had allegedly done to deserve the banishment.\n\nAt CPAC, Laura Loomer, a Trump supporter who was banned from Twitter in November after criticizing newly elected Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar, discussed her role in a recent investigation of Omar. Loomer asserted that pressure from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which has connections to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, was responsible for Twitter's banning her.\n\nLoomer also had a brief video interview with Donald Trump Jr. at CPAC, during which she gave him one of her red #StopTheBias hats and asked about taking action against social-media censorship. Trump Jr. responded, \"It's time.\"\n\nIf Kassam's analysis is correct, the ongoing campaign of online censorship could have significant consequences for the tech giants, as they may be forced to pay a high price for attempting to deprive Americans of their freedom of speech. The issue of online censorship is a complex and contentious one, and it remains to be seen how it will be addressed in the future.",
    " Title: Kentucky Senate Race: Candidates Dodge Questions in Debate, Raising Questions About Political Calculus\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the highly anticipated debate for the Kentucky US Senate race, incumbent Republican Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes each evaded a significant question from the moderator, leading to speculation about the political strategy behind their evasions and the potential impact on their campaigns.\n\nThe focus of this article is on the evasive tactics employed by both candidates during the debate, particularly in response to questions about their political leanings and policy positions.\n\nFirst, let's discuss Ms. Grimes, the Kentucky Secretary of State. A viral video from Friday showed her refusing to answer a question about whether she voted for President Obama during an interview with The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Kentucky. In the debate, she explained her evasion by stating that, as the chief election official, she felt it was her duty to uphold the right to a secret ballot.\n\nGrimes's evasion was met with criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. Some argued that her refusal to answer a seemingly straightforward question was evasive and damaging to her credibility. On the other hand, some argue that the question was unnecessary, as her support for President Obama is already well-known.\n\nSenator McConnell, too, evaded a question about climate change, a topic of relevance in a state heavily reliant on the coal industry. In the past, McConnell has stated, \"I'm not a scientist,\" implying that he is not qualified to discuss the causes of climate change. When asked about his stance on climate change during the debate, McConnell brushed past the question, focusing instead on his efforts to protect coal jobs in Kentucky.\n\nPolitical analysts suggest that both candidates' evasions are part of a calculated political strategy. By not answering questions that could potentially harm their campaigns, they are able to avoid alienating key constituencies or taking positions that could be used against them in campaign advertisements.\n\nHowever, some observers argue that the candidates' evasions may not matter much, as both candidates are pro-coal and the question of climate change is not a significant voting issue in Kentucky.\n\nIn conclusion, the first debate in the Kentucky US Senate race saw both candidates evade questions about their political leanings and policy positions. While some argue that this evasion is part of a calculated political strategy, others believe that the candidates' positions on these issues are already well-known and that the questions were unnecessary. Regardless, the debate raised questions about the political calculus behind the candidates' evasions and the potential impact on their campaigns.",
    " Title: President Obama's Visit to Israel: A Trust-Building Mission\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama landed in Israel this morning, marking his first visit to the country as president. Speaking at a welcoming ceremony at Tel Aviv airport, Obama said, \"I see this visit as an opportunity to reaffirm the unbreakable bond between our nations, to restate America's unwavering commitment to Israel's security, and to speak directly to the people of Israel and to your neighbors.\"\n\nNPR's Larry Abramson, who is at the airport, reported that Obama was welcomed by Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The leaders reaffirmed the \"unbreakable alliance\" between the countries, according to Larry.\n\nObama is now on his way to tour Israel's Iron Dome, the country's missile defense system, which the United States has helped fund. Later today, he will head to Jerusalem, and tomorrow, he will cross into Ramallah in the West Bank.\n\nThe New York Times reports that Obama does not arrive in the region with grand plans to revive stalled peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. Instead, the president is seeking to make a connection with the Israeli people, many of whom view him with a jaundiced eye after four years in which he sparred with Mr. Netanyahu over issues like Iran and the Jewish settlements in the West Bank.\n\nThe highlight of the trip will be a speech Obama will deliver to students at the Jerusalem International Convention Center on Thursday. The Washington Post reports the president is expected to reassure Israel of the United States' commitment to its security as Israel \"seeks to counter threats from Iran and protect its people in the midst of civil war in neighboring Syria.\"\n\nLarry called this a \"trust-building visit.\" He says that even though both sides insist there are no problems between the two countries, the fact is there has been some tension. \"There have been questions about whether or not the Israelis are a little too eager to possibly attack Iran in order to keep it from getting a nuclear bomb. And there are also questions about whether or not Israel is serious about resuming peace talks with the Palestinians, but nobody is really expecting any big initiatives by the United States or the Israelis on those two fronts at this point,\" Larry told our Newscast unit.\n\nPresident Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just wrapped up a 45-minute press conference in which they addressed the peace process, Iran, and Syria. During the press conference, President Obama was asked by NBC's Chuck Todd why peace talks stalled during his first term. Obama said that going into his presidency, he did not promise to bring peace to the Middle East, instead, he said, he would start on the process immediately.\n\nHowever, the bottom line, he said, is that \"this is not easy.\" Netanyahu was asked directly whether Israel and the United States believed that Iran was a year away from producing a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu said the countries \"share information and we share the same assessment on the schedule.\"\n\nPresident Obama said that \"each country has to make its own decision\" when it comes to war. But he believed that on the question of Iran, there was \"still time to solve this diplomatically.\" On Syria, President Obama defended the United States, saying it has done a lot to try to bring the conflict to a resolution. \"I have made clear the use of chemical weapons is a game changer,\" Obama said. His team, he added, is currently trying to assess whether the Syrian government has used those weapons.\n\n\"Israel will have no greater friend than the United States,\" President Obama said during an appearance with Israeli President Shimon Peres. Peres, for his part, told Obama that his vision of peace for the region can be accomplished. He said he believed Obama when he said, \"peace is not only a wish but a possibility.\"\n\nObama and Peres opened their meeting with a planting ceremony. Obama brought Peres a magnolia tree from the White House garden. \"This is the work of generations,\" Obama said about peace. He framed that quote with a story from the Talmud about Honi and the carob tree. The tree yields carobs 70 years after it's planted. So what's the point of planting one, if you may never eat its fruits, Honi asks a man. The man tells him that when he came into the world, his father and grandfathers had planted carob trees for him to enjoy. The man said he was planting carob trees for his children and grandchildren.",
    " Title: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Approves Mike Pompeo's Nomination for Secretary of State\n\nArticle:\n\nMike Pompeo, the current CIA director, secured a favorable vote on Monday from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, thanks to a last-minute endorsement from Sen. Rand Paul. This unexpected endorsement has smoothed the path for Pompeo's confirmation as secretary of state, potentially as early as this week.\n\nInitially, Pompeo seemed likely to receive an unfavorable recommendation from the committee, with Paul firmly opposed. However, the Kentucky Republican changed his stance after personal appeals from President Donald Trump. Had Paul not changed his vote, Pompeo would have been the third nominee in two decades to receive a negative report in committee, and likely the first in that time to win a vote in the full Senate.\n\nPaul's change of heart on Pompeo came after several conversations with Trump and assurances that the hawkish nominee views the Iraq War as a mistake and seeks to wind down the U.S. presence in Afghanistan.\n\n\"President Trump believes that Iraq was a mistake, that regime change has destabilized the region, and that we must end our involvement with Afghanistan,\" Paul said in a statement. \"Having received assurances from President Trump and Director Pompeo that he agrees with the president on these important issues, I have decided to support his nomination to be our next Secretary of State.\"\n\nTrump praised Paul after the libertarian's change of heart on Pompeo, according to a pool report.\n\nThe final vote count on Pompeo's nomination sparked temporary intrigue in the committee, as Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) agreed to vote \"present\" despite his opposition. This allowed Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) to steer the nominee to the floor without waiting for the delayed Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) to vote. The final roll call was 11-9.\n\nPompeo is expected to win confirmation from the full Senate later this week with unified GOP support and backing from a handful of vulnerable Democrats. After Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota became the first Democrat to announce her support on Thursday, Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) followed suit on Monday.\n\nAmong the Democrats who remain undecided on Pompeo are Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia, Doug Jones of Alabama, and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire became the latest Democrat to come out in opposition to Pompeo on Monday.\n\nActivists on the left who have pushed Democrats to oppose Pompeo, citing his past suggestion that Islamic leaders might be \"potentially complicit\" in terrorism as well as other politically volatile stances, lauded the committee's minority for staying united in opposition.\n\n\"We were glad to see Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hold firm and say that an Islamophobic, anti-woman, climate change-denying, pro-torture war hawk is an unacceptable choice to serve as our country\u2019s secretary of state,\" Elizabeth Beavers, foreign policy manager at the liberal group Indivisible, said in a statement.",
    " Title: U.S. Military Bases Increase Security Levels Due to Terror Threats\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - The U.S. Department of Defense has increased security conditions at military bases across the country due to growing concerns about terror threats, officials confirmed on Friday. The security level has been raised to \"Force Protection Bravo,\" the third-highest threat level on a five-tier scale.\n\nThe decision was not prompted by a specific threat but rather due to several recent incidents that have raised concerns, according to U.S. military officials. One such incident involved a jihadist linked to the Garland attack tweeting the name and address of a U.S. military officer connected to the military's Syrian rebel training program.\n\nThe tweet, published on an account connected to British-born jihadist Junaid Hussain, appeared to encourage an attack on the address and was sent out a few days before the attack on a cartoon exhibit featuring drawings of the Prophet Mohammed. Hussain is also believed to have been messaging with Elton Simpson, one of the two attackers of the Texas event, and had been urging Simpson to take action.\n\nThis followed the publishing of the names and addresses of about 100 military members on ISIS-connected accounts several weeks ago. FBI Director James Comey told reporters on Thursday that there are thousands of ISIS followers online in the U.S.\n\n\"We have a general concern, obviously, that ISIL is focusing on the uniformed military and law enforcement,\" Comey told reporters.\n\nThe order to upgrade the threat level was signed by Admiral William Gortney, head of the U.S. Northern Command, which oversees all U.S. military installations in the continental U.S. The security order affects 3,200 sites, including bases, National Guard facilities, recruiting stations, and health clinics, a Pentagon official said.\n\nCaptain Jeff Davis, spokesman for the U.S. Northern Command, or NORTHCOM, said, \"We have the same concern about the potential threat posed by violent homegrown extremists.\"\n\nThe change in threat level status could mean more checks of vehicles entering bases and more thorough identity checks of all personnel. Davis emphasized that \"this is the new normal, that we are going to have increased vigilance and force protection. We seek to be unpredictable.\"\n\nThe order to raise the force protection level to Bravo also applies to all National Guard installations, recruiting stations, and ROTC detachments. However, a U.S. military official acknowledged that it will be difficult for ROTC detachments to do much more than security awareness.\n\nIn addition, security was recently raised at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, in response to a perceived threat to the base security. The threat was never deemed credible, but it came after another security concern at a base in Delaware used by Vice President Joe Biden when he flies home.\n\nOn Friday, Wright-Patterson announced that the Air Force museum, which is part of the base, was canceling a planned Friday night concert and was stopping tours that were regularly offered until further notice. The base said this was \"due to elevated security measures.\"\n\nSince NORTHCOM was established in October 2002, the threat level has reached Bravo on four occasions: Feb. 9, 2003, amid concerns al Qaeda was planning attacks on American targets; Dec. 21, 2003, when officials were concerned about attacks during the holiday season; May 1, 2011, in the aftermath of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden; and the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. It reached \"Delta,\" its highest level, on Sept. 11, 2001, Pentagon officials told CNN at the time.",
    " Title: Altered Historical Record: National Archives Removes and Apologizes for Edited Photograph from Women's March\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, the National Archives removed and apologized for an altered photograph from the 2017 Women's March on Washington, following public outcry and media scrutiny. The photograph, which was part of a display at the National Archives Research Center, had the word \"Trump\" blurred on a sign that originally read \"God Hates Trump.\" Other signs in the same picture, which originally contained the words \"vagina\" and \"pussy,\" were also edited.\n\nThe National Archives offered two arguments and one excuse for the alterations. The excuse was that the altered photograph was not part of a current exhibition at the Archives, tracing a hundred years of the suffragist movement, but merely a display that advertised the show. The arguments were that the words referring to female anatomy may strike visitors as \"inappropriate\" and that the Archives are a \"non-partisan, non-political federal agency.\"\n\nThe altered photograph, taken by photographer Ellen Shub, is a stark reminder of her lifelong work documenting social protests. Shub, who died last month at the age of seventy-three, was known for her text-centric photographs, which served as a historical record of social movements and protests. Many of her photographs were published in alternative and movement media, including gay and lesbian newspapers, feminist newspapers, and city weeklies.\n\nThe incident at the National Archives has sparked comparisons to the Soviet system for excising people, objects, and facts from photographs. The analogy suggests that the head and staff of the National Archives may not have given themselves a moment to consider their actions, perhaps because their actions seemed so logical and right to them. The swift media reaction and public outcry may have been instrumental in correcting the record, but as philosopher Hannah Arendt warns, history lost, even if only temporarily, is still memory lost.\n\nThe incident at the National Archives raises questions about the role of historical institutions in preserving and presenting the truth, and the potential dangers of political bias in shaping historical narratives. The incident also highlights the importance of media scrutiny and public engagement in holding institutions accountable for their actions and ensuring the accuracy of historical records.",
    " Title: Ecuador Delays Decision on Edward Snowden's Asylum Request for Up to Two Months\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a developing story, former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden remains in transit at a Moscow airport, as Ecuador announced that it could take up to two months to approve his political asylum bid. The delay in decision-making comes as Ecuador faces international scrutiny and potential consequences for offering asylum to Snowden, who is wanted by the US government for leaking top-secret information on US surveillance programs.\n\nEcuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Patino, stated yesterday that if Snowden were to seek asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy, a decision would be made. He acknowledged the parallel with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up in the South American country's embassy in London for over a year.\n\nSnowden is wanted by the US government after leaking top-secret information to The Guardian, The Washington Post, and a Hong Kong-based newspaper, where he first sought refuge. The US revoked his passport, but he managed to flee Hong Kong on Sunday. Reuters reports that Ecuador denies granting Snowden special travel documents.\n\nInitially, Snowden was expected to leave Russia on Monday on a flight to Cuba, but he did not board the plane. Some speculate that Snowden has already left the Moscow airport and is making his way toward Ecuador's embassy there.\n\nEcuador has come under fire for offering Snowden asylum, with calls in the US Congress to cut off aid to the country. National security analyst Aaron Cohen told Fox News that the US is giving millions of dollars to Ecuador, which may potentially be harboring someone responsible for one of the most massive intelligence leaks in history.\n\nEcuador has received $144.4 million in US aid over the past five years, according to Fox. Some speculate that Ecuador is taking its time considering the asylum application in order to come across as seriously weighing the legal implications of Snowden's asylum request, while others point to the media attention Ecuador garners while the decision is pending.\n\nEcuador's embassy official, Efra\u00edn Baus, stated that Snowden's application will be reviewed responsibly, as are the many other asylum applications that Ecuador receives each year. Ecuador does have an extradition agreement with the United States, but makes exceptions for political crimes, reports The \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nSteve Striffler, a Latin America specialist at the University of New Orleans, wrote on CNN that Ecuador's President Rafael Correa isn't considering Snowden's asylum request just to gain political points at home. He notes that after offering Mr. Assange asylum in 2012, President Correa actually fueled opposition party criticism.\n\nPoliticians are always looking to score political points, and Correa has certainly had his moments. However, Correa's stance is best seen as a principled one, according to Striffler. In broad terms, Correa's openness to Assange and Snowden, as well as his decision to close a US military base in Ecuador, is part of an effort to deepen Ecuadorian sovereignty while strengthening Latin America's ability to limit the influence of the United States in the region.\n\nMany have criticized Ecuador for the apparent irony in its support of freedom of information when it comes to individuals like Assange and Snowden sharing top-secret information, but deterring expression at home. The country recently passed a media law that contains \"questionable or dangerous provisions\" to clamp down on criticism by the press, according to Reporters without Borders.\n\nThere could be some immediate political and economic consequences for Ecuador if it does indeed grant Snowden asylum, as well. The renewal of preferential treatment for trading certain products, including roses and tuna, is on the table, reports The New York Times.\n\nMichael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue told the Times, \"The risks are enormous\u2026 It would bring the United States down very hard on him.\" Others, however, say preferential treatment was already at risk of not being renewed.\n\n\"The US doesn't have too many measures it can utilize, other than to criticize,\" says Jonas Wolff, a senior research fellow at the Frankfurt-based Peace Research Institute. The Guardian's Stephen Kinzer says Ecuador is a good choice for Snowden because even if Ecuador's government drastically changes in coming years, the region as a whole has moved away from falling in line behind US policy.",
    " Title: ABC News Under Fire for Alleged Cover-Up of Jeffrey Epstein Story\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, a video has emerged this week that appears to show ABC News spiking a story about billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, a story that could have exposed the disgraced financier as a sex offender. This comes on the heels of allegations by journalist Ronan Farrow that NBC News suppressed his reporting on alleged rapist Harvey Weinstein to protect their own in-house sexual abuser, morning anchor Matt Lauer.\n\nThe video, featuring anchor Amy Robach, was recorded off-air and shows her expressing frustration over ABC executives' decision to kill her story about Epstein, which she had been sitting on for three years. Robach said she had an interview with Virginia Roberts, who made allegations of sexual abuse against Epstein.\n\n\"I've had this interview with Virginia Roberts... We would not put it on the air... I was told, 'Who's Jeffrey Epstein? No one knows who that is. This is a stupid story.' Then the palace found out we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways... And then Alan Dershowitz was also implicated in it because of the planes,\" Robach said in the video.\n\nEpstein, a wealthy money manager with close ties to many top establishment figures, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, was indicted for sexually abusing scores of underage girls in 2007. However, with the help of high-profile lawyers such as Ken Starr, Jay Lefkowitz, and Alan Dershowitz, Epstein negotiated a 13-month sentence with former U.S. Attorney and later Trump Labor Secretary Alex Acosta.\n\nThe Epstein case serves as a stark reminder of the growing chasm between our society's elites and the rest of us. If the super-wealthy and super-connected can get away with raping young girls with almost no punishment, our system is clearly broken.\n\nAfter the video was released, Robach issued a statement, saying her comments were a \"private moment of frustration.\" ABC claimed they didn't run the interview because they \"could not obtain sufficient corroborating evidence to meet ABC's editorial standards about her allegations.\"\n\nHowever, ABC's claims that the story didn't run because of a lack of \"corroborating evidence\" are hard to accept, given that the same network ran outlandish and uncorroborated reports about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, peddled at the time by now-disgraced Democratic activist and lawyer Michael Avenatti. There's no explanation for such disparate treatment besides pure bias.\n\nThere is one further explanation: politically partisan bias. Avenatti's claims were made against Kavanaugh, a Republican. The claims against Epstein potentially implicated former President Bill Clinton. ABC's lead news anchor is George Stephanopoulos, Bill Clinton's former staffer.\n\nCBS News, MSNBC, and CNN have largely ignored the Robach video. ABC, in addition to their clearly bogus statement, responded by searching for the whistleblower who released the video. Reports indicate that ABC found the whistleblower was working at CBS, and CBS followed up by firing the whistleblower.\n\nTaken together, we have all three major U.S. television broadcast networks implicated to some degree in covering for rapists. NBC, in Farrow's new book, is accused of killing his report on alleged rapist Weinstein, another Clinton confidant. ABC anchor Robach is claiming that ABC News killed her report on alleged child rapist Epstein. And CBS News has now fired the woman who released the Robach video.\n\nA recent Gallup poll found that 69% of Americans have lost trust in the news media over the past decade. Based on these sordid events of the past couple of months, that number may now be closer to 100%.",
    " Title: President Trump Expresses Optimism Over North Korea's Nuclear Disarmament Following Historic Summit with Kim Jong Un\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of his groundbreaking summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, President Donald Trump expressed optimism that the North Korean leader will initiate the process of dismantling his country's nuclear program \"virtually immediately.\" The historic agreement, signed in Singapore, outlines Pyongyang's commitment to work toward the \"complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\"\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Trump stated, \"We are now going to start the process of denuclearization of North Korea, and I believe that he's [Kim Jong Un] going to start it virtually immediately \u2013 and he's already indicated that, and you look at what he's done.\"\n\nThe agreement was the culmination of several meetings between the two leaders throughout the day. When asked by a reporter if Kim had agreed to denuclearize, Trump responded, \"We are starting that process very quickly.\"\n\nAt a press conference, Trump announced that he will be ending joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea. He also stated that Kim had agreed to destroy a \"major\" missile testing site, although specific details were not provided.\n\nThe joint declaration states that the U.S. has committed to providing \"security guarantees\" to Pyongyang. The extent of these guarantees remains unclear, but Trump sounded optimistic as he left the summit, stating that the two leaders \"got along from the beginning\" and Kim understood the need to dismantle his nuclear program.\n\nThe summit, which almost did not occur, marked a significant shift from the tension between Washington and Pyongyang last summer, when Trump and Kim exchanged a war of words, with the American president warning the dictator of \"fire and fury.\" However, Trump told Fox News that \"without the rhetoric, we wouldn't have been here.\"\n\nAs for the future, Trump insisted, \"I think he's [Kim] gone back to get this done. He wants to get it done.\" During a gaggle with reporters on Air Force One later in the day, Trump said he trusts Kim but emphasized that the U.S. would have to \"check\" to ensure denuclearization occurs. \"We're going to have to check him. And we will check him very strongly,\" Trump said. \"He has a plan total and complete, he's got a total plan. It will get done.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he had any concerns about Kim, the president insisted Kim \"wants to get it done.\" He added, \"And we should all want that to happen.\"",
    " Title: GOP Presidential Candidate Ben Carson Defends Flat Tax Plan, Discusses Foreign Policy and Controversial Remarks\n\nIn a recent interview on Fox News Sunday, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson defended his proposed flat tax plan, stating that it is \"condescending\" to suggest that poor people cannot pay taxes. The 63-year-old Carson, who grew up poor in Detroit before becoming a renowned pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University, argued that his plan, which he refers to as a \"proportional tax,\" is fair and based on the biblical concept of tithing.\n\nUnder Carson's plan, individuals making $10 billion a year would pay $1 billion in taxes, while those making as little as $100 would pay $1. He argued that this would make it more difficult for politicians to raise taxes since they would be raised on everyone. However, host Chris Wallace countered that experts suggest a flat tax rate of 20% would be necessary to match current revenue, which would result in low- and middle-income families facing a tax hike while the wealthy would see a tax cut. Carson disputed these numbers, stating that his numbers are closer to 10-15%.\n\nCarson also discussed his foreign policy, particularly his stance on Russia. When asked if \"all options\" should remain open for dealing with Russia, Carson replied, \"All options includes all options.\" He clarified that this does not mean war would be his first option, but that he would deal with Ukraine differently than President Barack Obama has. Carson pointed out that Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons on the promise of defense from the United States and other Western powers, and he suggested that a military option may be necessary if Russia invades again.\n\nCarson also addressed two controversial statements he has made in the past. In a 2014 interview with Breitbart.com, Carson stated that Americans feel intimidated by their own government and compared modern America to Nazi Germany. In a 2013 speech, Carson compared Obamacare to slavery. Carson defended these statements on Sunday, arguing that Obamacare fundamentally changes the relationship between the people and the government and that Americans feel intimidated by the government due to the threat of IRS audits and other repercussions.\n\nFinally, Carson was asked about his statement last week that, as president, he would not have to enforce \"judicial law.\" Carson clarified on Sunday that the president or the executive branch is obligated to carry out the laws of the land, according to the Constitution. He pointed to the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, which disallowed slaves to sue for their freedom, as an example of a judicial decision with which he disagreed. Carson stated that the laws of the land, according to the Constitution, are provided by the legislative branch.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Dispute Erupts Over Trump Administration's Decision to End ObamaCare Subsidies\n\nArticle:\n\nA legal battle has ensued between the Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia, and the Trump administration, following the White House's decision to end payments to health insurers under the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare). The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California, alleges that the president's move to halt the payments is an attempt to undermine the health and well-being of the nation.\n\nThe states involved in the lawsuit include California, Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. They are seeking the court's intervention to compel the Trump administration to make the next payment to insurers, scheduled for October 18.\n\nIn a separate court case, the Justice Department notified a federal appeals court in Washington on Friday that the payment \"would not occur.\" A federal judge has previously found that Congress never properly approved the payments, which have continued under Obama and Trump until now, despite prior threats by the president to block them.\n\nThe subsidies, amounting to approximately $7 billion this year, are used by companies to lower out-of-pocket costs like co-payments and deductibles for low- and middle-income customers. Congressional Democrats have vowed to push for a bipartisan deal to restore the money by the end of the year.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi denounced Trump's move to end the payments as a \"spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America.\"\n\nPresident Trump, speaking at the Values Voter Summit, defended his decision, stating, \"Congress, they forgot what their pledges were.\" He added, \"So we're going a little different route. But you know what? In the end, it's going to be just as effective, and maybe it will even be better.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has expressed openness to continuing the payments, provided they are accompanied by significant changes. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, has also supported the continuation of the payments, citing their impact on premiums.\n\nThe decision is part of Trump's broader effort to \"repeal and replace\" ObamaCare, and is expected to cause instability in already-unsteady insurance marketplaces. The legal and political battle over the payments is likely to continue, with both parties seeking a resolution that addresses the needs of their constituents.",
    " Title: Senate Leaders Negotiate Government Reopening and Debt Ceiling Deal, but Hurdles Remain\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Senate leaders have outlined a potential deal to end the two-week-old government shutdown and provide the Treasury Department with enough borrowing room to avoid a potential default this month. However, the specifics of the agreement are still under negotiation, and all sides have cautioned that the deal is far from finalized.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and his Republican counterpart, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), have agreed on the broad strokes of the deal. The government would be funded for several months, and President Obama would be given room to raise the debt ceiling into next year. The House and Senate would appoint negotiators to try to reach a broader budget deal in the meantime.\n\nHowever, the exact dates of the debt and spending extensions, and the add-ons, such as delays or restrictions on Obamacare, are still under negotiation, aides said. The length of the stopgap funding bill, the amount of borrowing authority to give the Treasury Department, and the specific changes to Obamacare are all points of contention.\n\nEven if Mr. Reid and Mr. McConnell are able to strike a deal, it's unclear whether it could pass the GOP-controlled House, where conservatives have expressed skepticism. \"When you're giving 98, 99 percent of Obamacare, I don't see how that would ever pass over here, if indeed it passes the Senate,\" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-KS).\n\nThe mere prospects of a deal that would give the government more room to expand its $16.7 trillion debt sent the stock markets higher on Monday. President Obama had asked the top party leaders to come to the White House for talks on Monday afternoon but canceled the meeting, saying it made more sense to give Mr. Reid and Mr. McConnell space to work.\n\nFor his part, the president visited a local food bank, Martha's Table, where some furloughed federal workers were helping out. Mr. Obama said \"some progress\" had been made, but he cautioned that \"we'll see if the progress is real.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department has said it will run out of borrowing room on Thursday, leaving it with only cash on hand to pay bills. That could last a couple of weeks, or it could be exhausted almost immediately, analysts said. If a deal is not reached, the consequences could be severe, with the potential for a devastating effect on the economy.\n\nThe White House has been insistent that the government reopen and the debt be raised without any conditions, repeatedly comparing Republican demands on Obamacare to hostage-taking and terrorism. House Republicans remain a major hurdle, and conservatives have expressed concern about the lack of Obamacare-related concessions in the deal.\n\nAs the negotiations continue, both party leaders are discussing strategy, such as which chamber should go first and how many House Democrats would be needed to pass the deal there. The fate of the deal remains uncertain, but all sides are working towards a resolution to end the shutdown and avoid a default.",
    " Title: A Reflection on National Unity and Identity Politics in the 21st Century\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the United States witnessed a surge of national unity and camaraderie that was unprecedented. However, as the years have passed, the question remains: Where has the spirit of unity gone, and what has replaced it?\n\nIn an article by William Murchison, he suggests that in 2001, under the threat of a global enemy, Americans found and asserted their American identity. The events of 9/11 brought people together, and the nation came together in the interest of punishing the perpetrators. The unity, however, did not last, and the country has since become a series of subdivisions, with group identity taking precedence over national identity.\n\nMurchison argues that identity politics has become the new brand of politics, with each group asserting its demands over the needs and rights of others. He notes that while the United States has always had its share of divisions, the indisposition to cut slack for anyone besides ourselves is the main and most frightening feature of today's politics.\n\nMurchison also points out that the American ideal of freedom to pursue legitimate interests is being challenged by those who view themselves as uniquely deserving or put-upon. The president's war on free trade, the elimination of Confederate monuments, and the secularist's airbrushing of Christianity from the American canvas are all examples of this trend.\n\nMurchison is currently writing a book about moral restoration in the 21st century, and his article serves as a call to reevaluate the state of national unity and identity politics in the United States. He urges readers to remember the spirit of unity that marked the aftermath of 9/11 and to work towards a more accommodating and inclusive society, where the needs and rights of all constituencies are considered.",
    " Title: Post-Republican National Convention: Analyzing Mitt Romney's Poll Bounce and Image Improvement\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Republican National Convention, there appears to be a slight poll bounce for Mitt Romney, but the overall race remains tight. The convention seems to have improved Romney's image, particularly his likeability, according to various polls.\n\nAccording to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, Romney's overall favorability improved, but there was no significant change in the number of voters who would cast their ballot for him. The poll showed Romney steadily improving in likeability and other positive-image features.\n\nRasmussen Reports' data showed a six-point swing in Romney's favor following the Republican National Convention. Prior to the convention, Romney trailed President Barack Obama by two points, but now holds a four-point lead. This poll also showed Romney surging ahead by two points in 11 key swing states.\n\nGallup's data, published prior to the Tampa convention, indicated that the GOP had slightly bolstered its image compared to 2008, while Democrats' favorability has dropped significantly over the same period.\n\nThe information is relevant as it informs the composition of the 2012 electorate and predicts the election's outcome. The Rasmussen Report's 37.6 percent GOP self-identification number should be kept in mind when interpreting polls that peg the Republican segment of the electorate in the mid-twenties.\n\nAn update on a snap poll of Florida voters also bodes well for Romney, suggesting a potential advantage in a crucial swing state. However, it is important to note that holiday weekend polling is notoriously unreliable.\n\nOverall, while the polls show a slight improvement for Romney, the race remains tight, and both candidates have work to do to secure the support of undecided voters.",
    " Title: Evolution of Abortion Stances: A Comparative Analysis of Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg's Responses\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate on abortion rights, two Democratic presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, have recently offered their perspectives on the issue during town hall events.\n\nDuring an MSNBC town hall on February 4, 2020, in Manchester, N.H., Senator Bernie Sanders was asked, \"Is there such a thing as a pro-life Democrat in your vision of the party?\" Sanders responded, \"I think being pro-choice is an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat... When we talk about what a Democrat is, I think being pro-choice is an essential part of that.\"\n\nThis stance represents a shift from Sanders' position in 2017, when he campaigned for Heath Mello, an Omaha, Neb., mayoral candidate who was labeled \"anti-abortion\" for supporting a bill that required doctors to inform women of their ultrasound rights. However, it's essential to note that the bill did not mandate women to undergo an ultrasound.\n\nIn contrast, during a Fox News town hall, Pete Buttigieg was asked, \"Do you want the support of... pro-life Democratic voters?... If so, would you support more-moderate platform language in the Democratic party to ensure that the party of diversity, of inclusion really does include everybody?\" Buttigieg responded evasively, stating, \"The best I can offer is that if we can't agree on where to draw the line, the next best thing we can do is agree on who should draw the line. And in my view, it's the woman who's faced with that decision in her own life.\"\n\nThe abortion debate is complex, and both candidates' responses highlight different approaches to the issue. Sanders' stance is clear, emphasizing the importance of choice, while Buttigieg's response was more equivocal, focusing on personal autonomy and the role of the individual in drawing the line.\n\nIt is noteworthy that both candidates have been questioned about their stance on pro-life Democrats, and their responses have been met with varying degrees of directness. Sanders' response can be seen as a step towards transparency, while Buttigieg's response, though evasive, may reflect a more nuanced understanding of the issue.\n\nAs the primary race continues, the abortion debate will likely remain a contentious issue, and the candidates' responses will continue to shape the discourse surrounding reproductive rights.",
    " Title: Obama Campaign Outspends Romney in June, but Faces Challenges in Polls and Favorability Ratings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Barack Obama's re-election campaign outspent Mitt Romney's in June, despite Romney's fundraising advantage, according to campaign reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. The Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee spent $70.8 million in June, while Romney and the Republican National Committee spent $38.8 million.\n\nThe Obama campaign reported more than $46 million in direct contributions in June and total spending of $58 million, leaving them with significantly less cash on hand than Romney and the Republicans. The Obama campaign spent about $38 million on television advertising in June, while Romney and the Republican National Committee spent about $11 million.\n\nHowever, the spending advantage may not translate into electoral success, as recent polls show a tight race between the two candidates. In the head-to-head race, Romney holds a statistically-insignificant 47 to 46 percent lead in the new New York Times/CBS poll, and Obama is stuck at 47 percent in recent polls by Fox News and NPR.\n\nMore troubling for the Obama campaign is the worsening economic news and the public's perception of the president's handling of the economy. In the CBS/NYT poll, Obama's job approval dropped to 44 percent, with only 39 percent approving of his economic performance -- down five points from April. For the first time since January, more voters now think the economy is getting worse.\n\nAnother red flag for Team Obama is the president's crumbling favorability ratings, a troubling departure from his previous strength. In the CBS/NYT poll, Obama is underwater on the favorability question by double digits, with more Americans developing a poor overall perception of Obama the man, independent from their misgivings about his leadership. Obama's favorability with independents is 28/52, with Romney actually above water at 32/31.\n\nThe media should be asking whether Obama's Bain attacks are hurting Obama rather than focusing on the impact on Romney. I'll leave you with this related nugget, reported by the Weekly Standard over the weekend. Remember The One's big May re-elect kickoff event in Columbus? His campaign spent nearly $93,000 to rent a large arena -- and ended up with thousands of empty seats. Hyped expectations, disappointing results, huge expenditures, and resulting deficits. Sound familiar?",
    " Title: International Sanctions on Iran Lifted as IAEA Verifies Compliance with Nuclear Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) confirmation that Iran has complied with the terms of the nuclear deal, international sanctions on Iran have been lifted. The move, which was announced by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, is expected to contribute to improved regional and international peace and security.\n\nThe landmark deal, agreed upon last July, aims to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The lifting of sanctions will unfreeze billions of dollars of assets and allow Iran's oil to be sold internationally. The IAEA confirmed that Iran had taken the necessary steps, including reducing its number of centrifuges and dismantling a heavy-water reactor near the town of Arak, both of which could be used in creating nuclear weapons.\n\nIran has maintained that its nuclear program is peaceful, but some, such as US Republicans, argue that the deal does not do enough to ensure Iran cannot develop a nuclear bomb. US Secretary of State John Kerry has ordered that US nuclear-related economic sanctions against Iran be lifted.\n\nIn a statement, US Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan expressed concern, stating, \"Today, the Obama administration will begin lifting economic sanctions on the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other opponents of the deal have also expressed skepticism.\n\nIn a significant development, Iran has released Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and three other Iranian-American prisoners in an apparent prisoner swap with the United States. Rezaian, 39, was jailed on charges including espionage last November. The US is offering clemency to seven Iranians being held in the US for sanctions violation.\n\nThe IAEA has installed a device at the Natanz plant to monitor Iran's uranium enrichment activities in real time, in order to verify that uranium enrichment levels are kept at up to 3.67% as agreed in the deal with world powers. The organization's head, Yukiya Amano, is to visit Tehran on Sunday for meetings with President Rouhani and other officials.\n\nThe deal, which was agreed upon in July 2015, limits Iran's sensitive nuclear activities for more than a decade in return for the lifting of crippling sanctions. The US is confident the agreement will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran asserts it has the right to nuclear energy and stresses that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only. The sanctions have cost Iran more than $160bn in oil revenue since 2012 alone. Once they are lifted, the country will be able to resume selling oil on international markets and using the global financial system for trade. Iran has the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world, and the energy industry is braced for lower prices. Iran will also be able to access more than $100bn in assets frozen overseas.",
    " Title: Biden Challenges Perception of Democratic Party Shift, Critiques Progressive Wing in Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with Axios, set to air this weekend on HBO, former Vice President Joe Biden has taken aim at the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, particularly Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and other newly elected progressive Democrats. Biden suggested that these politicians do not represent the future of the Democratic Party as much as they represent a new party, distinct from the traditional Democratic apparatus.\n\nDuring the interview, Biden disputed the notion that the rise of progressive Democrats and \"Democratic socialists\" was a response to Hillary Clinton's loss to President Donald Trump in 2016. Biden claimed that the media's portrayal of the Democratic electorate as more liberal and left-leaning is inaccurate, according to Axios.\n\n\"You guys got it all wrong about what happened,\" Biden said, implying that the media has misrepresented the Democratic voter base. \"It's just bad judgment... AOC was a new party, she's a bright, wonderful person. But where's the party? Come on, man.\"\n\nBiden told \"Axios on HBO\" that he believes his rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are misinterpreting the party, and that Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) appeal to a narrow segment of voters who are more vocal but do not represent the Democratic electorate as a whole.\n\n\"The party's not there. The party's not there at all,\" Biden said, referring to where Warren and Sanders fall on the political spectrum. He reportedly added that he believes both Warren and Sanders have misread Democratic voters and are appealing to the wrong segment of primary voters.\n\nBiden's comments are not a departure from his long-held belief that he is a more moderate choice for the Democratic nominee. However, this is a significant development in that Biden has directly called out the progressive left wing of the party, including Ocasio-Cortez and the \"Squad,\" and suggested that they are a small segment of a larger Democratic party and not the future of the party as Ocasio-Cortez and her Justice Democrats claim.\n\nWhile Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez seem to represent a static element of the Democratic Party, both Sanders and Warren are vying for the same group of potential primary voters - mostly young, white, highly educated voters in urban centers. However, until now, most of the candidates targeting the middle, such as Biden and South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, have resisted the urge to suggest the progressive left is not part of the party.\n\nThe good news for Biden is that his newfound opposition to a leftward moving party may play well with voters in early primary states like Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada, where progressive ideas, like Medicare for All, do not seem to be resonating with voters.",
    " Title: Obama Urges House to Approve Comprehensive Immigration Reform, Citing Unfairness of Current System\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to advance his second-term agenda, President Barack Obama has called on House lawmakers to approve comprehensive immigration reform, stating that the current system is \"not fair.\"\n\nAddressing supporters of immigration reform in the East Room of the White House on Thursday, the President said, \"We have kicked this particular can down the road for too long.\" He emphasized, \"This is the moment when we should be able to finally get the job done. Let's go get it done.\"\n\nHouse Republican leaders have indicated they plan to hold an immigration debate this year, but they are unlikely to support the comprehensive reform bill passed by the Senate. With a short legislative calendar following a 16-day government shutdown, President Obama faces challenges in getting his priorities acted upon this year.\n\nThe President endorsed the Senate bill, which provides a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, arguing that it would benefit the economy and the country. He urged Republican leaders to disregard the political implications of the issue.\n\n\"I'm not running for office again; I just believe this is the right thing to do,\" Mr. Obama said. \"What we can't do is just sweep the problem under the rug one more time. Let's not delay, and let's do it in a bipartisan fashion.\"\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, has expressed opposition to the President's wishes, according to his spokesman, Brendan Buck. Buck stated, \"The speaker agrees that America has a broken immigration system and we need reform that would boost our economy. He's also been clear that the House will not consider any massive, Obamacare-style legislation that no one understands.\"\n\nInstead, the House is committed to a step-by-step approach to immigration reform, according to Buck. He added, \"We hope that the president will work with us \u2014 not against us \u2014 as we pursue this deliberate approach.\"",
    " Title: MIT Media Lab Director Resigns Amid Epstein Donation Scandal\n\nIn a significant development, the director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Media Lab, Joi Ito, has resigned effective immediately, following the revelation of the lab's attempts to conceal its relationship with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The resignation came less than a day after an article in The New Yorker detailed the Media Lab's handling of donations from Epstein, including a $2 million gift from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.\n\nAccording to internal emails obtained by The New York Times, in October 2014, six years after Epstein pleaded guilty to a sex charge involving a minor in Florida, Ito wrote that the gift from Gates had been \"directed by Jeffrey Epstein.\" A development official at the Media Lab, Peter Cohen, subsequently wrote, \"For gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey\u2019s name as the impetus for this gift.\"\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Gates said Epstein had been introduced to Gates as a person interested in increasing philanthropy. The statement also clarified that Epstein had not directed any programmatic or personal grant-making for Gates, and any claim to the contrary was false.\n\nThe resignation of Ito is part of a growing list of powerful individuals facing scrutiny for their connections to Epstein. This list includes President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Britain's Prince Andrew, high-profile scientists, business executives, and former U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, who resigned after his role in the 2008 plea agreement with Epstein was heavily criticized.\n\nThe Media Lab, a research institution that focuses on science, technology, and art, has been under fire for its association with Epstein, who donated millions to the lab over the years. The lab's relationship with Epstein has raised questions about the ethical standards of the institution and its leadership. The resignation of Ito marks a significant step towards addressing these concerns and restoring public trust in the Media Lab.",
    " Title: COVID-19 Patients Face Mental Health Challenges Amid Hospital Isolation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic has brought about a new challenge for some survivors: mental health issues stemming from hospital isolation. With many hospitals requiring adult patients to enter without family, the stress, loneliness, and fear experienced by patients, often magnified by invasive treatment procedures, place them at a high risk for disorders such as PTSD, according to some medical experts.\n\nLoneliness, a combination of thinking, feeling, and behaving, can have a significant impact on psychological and physical health, says Ami Rokach, a clinical psychologist and psychology teacher at York University in Toronto. While there are indications that people's resilience and increased use of communication technology may be helping lessen the broader impact of the pandemic on loneliness, the situation is different for COVID-19 patients.\n\nNot only is it stressful to be diagnosed with a new disease with minimal treatment options, but the virus itself can affect the brain, including psychiatric and neurological complications. Being alone through the prolonged treatment process can be \"heart-wrenching\" to watch, says Martha A.Q. Curley, a professor of pediatric nursing at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing.\n\n\"You have people who've lived 50, 60, 70 years together and they can't be with them when they're ill, they can't transition through the illness with them, and they can't be there when they die. [It] is just excruciatingly painful,\" Curley says.\n\nSome COVID-19 survivors may experience PTSD, which can last for years without treatment. Most people feel anxiety with the uncertainty of COVID-19, but some experience PTSD due to trauma and a \"threat to life or threat to physical integrity,\" says Anthony King, a professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"Clearly, the coronavirus disease is a threat to life,\" and the chance someone may experience PTSD may be exacerbated by patient isolation while fighting the disease, King says while cautioning further research is needed into anecdotal evidence. Long-term studies of past serious outbreaks found PTSD is much higher in patients than in the general population.\n\nIn one study, one-fourth of 90 SARS patients had PTSD 30 months after the outbreak, and 15.6% had a depressive disorder. Research has shown many ICU survivors experience trauma, particularly with procedures like intubation. Reports of post-intensive care syndrome are growing after patients with COVID-19 are discharged, which can be further complicated by the fact that family members do not know what the patient went through.\n\nFour doctors argue in a New England Journal of Medicine perspective piece that new guidelines should enable more regular telecommunication between isolated patients and their families. Curley, who is also a pediatric nurse at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, goes one step further and suggests steps can be taken to safely allow a family member into the ICU with a COVID-19 patient. Family facilitators can help with the careful screening, preparation, and support needed to undertake this goal, she says.\n\n\"We need to think of ways to make this happen. It will be different within each system, it will be different with each patient, but we ought to not just create a rule that families are not allowed,\" Curley adds.\n\nIsolated and faced with uncertainty and fear, some COVID-19 patients are at risk for trauma that experts say should be screened for and addressed at all stages of healthcare.",
    " Title: Democratic Primary Results Declare Hillary Clinton as Nominee, While Bernie Sanders Pushes for Change in Party's Stance on Israel\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a decisive move, the news media has declared Hillary Clinton the winner of Tuesday's Democratic presidential primaries, with the former secretary of state reaching the 2,383 delegates needed to secure her party's nomination. The announcement comes before the primaries in the six states set to vote Tuesday, including California, the largest.\n\nClinton, in a speech to her supporters, expressed her gratitude and emphasized the importance of voter participation, stating, \"We're going to come out of the primary even stronger to take on Donald Trump.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bernie Sanders' campaign has accused the media of rushing to judgment, with spokesperson Michael Briggs stating, \"It is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer. Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination.\"\n\nThe superdelegates will not vote until July 25, and Sanders has vowed to spend the time until then convincing them that he is the stronger candidate. Although Sanders' campaign may be winding down, he has left a significant impact on the Democratic Party, pushing it to the left on economic issues and attempting to change the party's platform on Israel.\n\nSanders has already named pro-Palestinian representatives to the platform committee, including those who support the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. The movement aims to delegitimize the Jewish state. Pro-Israel Democrats argue that changes in the party's platform regarding Israel would be met with resistance.\n\nHowever, recent data from the Pew Research Center suggests a shift in the sympathies of liberal Democrats. For the first time in a decade, the percentage of liberal Democrats sympathizing with Palestinians is greater than those aligning with Israel. This division could potentially lead to a contentious fight at the Democratic National Convention over the party's support.\n\nEven without a fight at the convention, the split could indicate a future shift in Democratic support, potentially moving the party towards more support for Palestinians and less for Israel. This development underscores the ongoing complexities and evolving dynamics within the Democratic Party.",
    " Title: Seaside Town Trapped in Apocalyptic Conditions as Australia Wildfires Rage On\n\nPERTH, Australia (AP) \u2014 Wildfires burning across Australia's two most populous states trapped residents of the seaside town of Mallacoota in Victoria state in apocalyptic conditions on Tuesday, with at least two people confirmed dead and numerous homes destroyed.\n\nAbout 4,000 residents in the southeastern town fled toward the water Tuesday morning as winds pushed an emergency-level wildfire toward their homes. The smoke-filled sky shrouded the town in darkness before turning an unnerving shade of bright red.\n\nAustralia's annual wildfire season, which peaks during the Southern Hemisphere summer, started early after an unusually warm and dry winter. Record-breaking heat and windy conditions triggered devastating wildfires in New South Wales and Queensland states in September.\n\nOver the past few months, about 5 million hectares (12.35 million acres) of land have burned nationwide, with 12 people confirmed dead and more than 1,000 homes destroyed. Nearly 100 fires were burning across the state of New South Wales, which is home to Sydney.\n\nNew South Wales state Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons described this wildfire season as the worst on record and painted a bleak long-term picture.\n\n\"We've seen extraordinary fire behavior,\" he said Tuesday. \"What we really need is meaningful rain, and we haven't got anything in the forecast at the moment that says we're going to get drought-breaking or fire-quenching rainfall.\"\n\nThe wildfire crisis has reignited debate about whether Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative government has taken enough action on climate change. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas.\n\nMorrison, whom critics have deemed a climate change skeptic, conceded earlier this month that \"climate change along with many other factors\" has contributed to the wildfires.\n\nThe prime minister faced criticism for going on a family vacation to Hawaii in December during the crisis. He eventually cut his trip short and publicly apologized.\n\nLate Tuesday, Mallacoota was saved by changes in wind direction, but authorities said \"numerous\" homes were lost. Residents returning home were urged to boil tap water before drinking it. Forest Fire Management Victoria said the wildfires had put heavy demands on tap water that is affecting the supply of water.\n\nStranded residents and vacationers were reported to be sleeping in cars on New Year's Eve, while gas stations and surf clubs transformed into evacuation areas.\n\nVictoria state Premier Daniel Andrews had earlier announced plans to evacuate the trapped people by sea. There were grave fears for four missing people. \"We can't confirm their whereabouts,\" Andrews told reporters Tuesday.\n\nAndrews has requested assistance from 70 firefighters from the United States and Canada, while Australia's military sent air and sea reinforcements.\n\nVictoria Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp confirmed \"significant\" property losses across the region. More than 115 communities across Victoria remained under emergency warnings Tuesday night.\n\nSome communities canceled New Year's fireworks celebrations, but Sydney's popular display over its iconic harbor controversially went ahead in front of more than a million revelers. The city was granted an exemption to a total fireworks ban in place there and elsewhere to prevent new wildfires.\n\nFire conditions in Victoria and New South Wales worsened after oppressive heat Monday mixed with strong winds and lightning.\n\nPolice in New South Wales said Tuesday that two men \u2014 a 63-year-old father and 29-year-old son \u2014 died in a house in the wildfire-ravaged southeast town of Cobargo, and a 72-year-old man remained missing.\n\n\"They were obviously trying to do their best with the fire as it came through in the early hours of the morning,\" New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said. \"The other person that we are trying to get to, we think that person was trying to defend their property in the early hours of the morning.\"\n\nOn Monday, a firefighter was killed when extreme winds flipped his truck. Samuel McPaul, 28, was the third volunteer firefighter in New South Wales to have died in the past two weeks. He was an expectant father.\n\nMore than 130 fires remain burning across New South Wales, with five at an emergency level. Authorities warned that power would be out for 24 hours along the fire-ravaged south coast of the state.",
    " Title: Anticipation Builds as Biden and Ryan Prepare for High-Stakes Vice Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the vice presidential debate tonight in Danville, Kentucky, both parties are gearing up for a showdown that promises to be a significant event in the 2012 presidential race. The debate, which will pit Vice President Joe Biden against Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, is expected to draw widespread attention and serve as a crucial precursor to the second presidential debate on Tuesday in New York.\n\nThe stakes are particularly high for Vice President Biden, following President Barack Obama's perceived lackluster performance in the first presidential debate, which saw Mitt Romney take a lead in national polls. Republicans have been eagerly anticipating this confrontation for months, believing that Ryan, the intellectual powerhouse of the GOP ticket, can expose any potential gaffes from the gaffe-prone Biden.\n\n\"It's the man with the 200-pound brain vs. Crazy Uncle Joe,\" says Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster. Democrats, on the other hand, believe Biden will come well-prepared and use the debate to expose what they see as the duplicity of the Romney-Ryan ticket, which has appeared to shift positions on issues such as abortion, education, and tax policy in recent days.\n\nVice presidential debates are often quickly forgotten, but this one is expected to be different. \"It will be very substantive, with probably two of the most substantive vice presidential candidates we've ever had,\" says David Carney, a Republican consultant. \"I think Biden's performance, in an ironic way, will put more pressure on [President] Obama for the next debate.\"\n\nFour years ago, the vice presidential debate between Biden and Republican Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska drew higher TV ratings than any of that year's presidential debates. This debate is also expected to draw considerable attention.\n\nBiden's task tonight is different from what it was four years ago. Then, he essentially ignored Palin in favor of attacking Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP nominee. This time, he'll still want to concentrate most of his fire on the other party's presidential candidate, but he will doubtless also use Ryan as a target. As the House Budget Committee chairman, Ryan is the architect of a spending plan that Democrats warn would gut domestic programs and threaten entitlements such as Medicare.\n\n\"Where Gov. Romney muddied the water, I think the vice president will try to clarify it,\" says Jared Bernstein, who served as an economic adviser to Biden in the White House. \"He's going to link the political agendas and the policy agendas so the electorate has a much better understanding than they did from the first debate.\"\n\nSince his selection as running mate, Ryan has served as the loyal soldier, shying away from some of the implications of his own budget and declaring that Romney sets the policy for the ticket. But if Democrats accuse the Republicans of duplicity, Republicans counter that Democrats have mismanaged the economy and do not have a record worth running on and so are relying on scare tactics.\n\nGoeas, the GOP pollster, predicts Ryan will drive home the point that, counter to Democratic claims, the Republican plan would not alter Medicare for those ages 55 and older. Republicans also hope that, under pressure, Biden could once again uncork a comment that takes on a life of its own. As Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University and expert on the vice presidency, points out, one gaffe can undo all the other successful messaging a vice presidential candidate might pull off during a debate.\n\nLast week, Biden attacked the GOP tax plan, but in so doing offered what sounded like a criticism of his own administration by saying the middle class has \"been buried the last four years.\" \"He's had a bad run of foot-in-mouth disease,\" says David Yepsen, director of a public policy institute at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. \"He really needs to avoid any of that. Part of getting Democrats back on track is having Joe Biden not make gaffes.\"\n\nBut Biden's gaffes tend to come \"from unregulated exuberance on the campaign trail,\" says Gary Bauer, president of American Values, a conservative group concerned with social issues. He'll presumably be more disciplined on stage during his key moment in the entire campaign.\n\nAnd Republicans who have anticipated Ryan outmatching the vice president are likely to be disappointed. Biden spent 36 years in the Senate, chairing important committees in charge of both domestic and foreign issues. \"Paul Ryan is a wonk at heart\u2014he's the brains of this particular Congress,\" says Tara McGuinness, executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the progressive think tank's advocacy wing. \"Joe Biden, though very experienced in politics, is a storyteller at heart.\"\n\nRyan, who was born two years before Biden was first elected to the Senate, needs to show he has some \"gravitas,\" Yepsen says. Republicans from Romney on down have tried to downplay expectations for Ryan's performance in recent days, pointing out that he has not engaged in a campaign debate since he first ran for Congress 14 years ago.\n\nTed Kaufman, a longtime Biden aide who succeeded him in the Senate after his ascension to the vice presidency, says Ryan will be ready. \"Ryan will do a good job,\" Kaufman says. \"Anyone who has been a member of Congress for 14 years knows how to present their positions well and how to challenge the positions of the other side.\"",
    " Title: Escalation in Eastern Ukraine: New Offensive and Alleged Russian Military Involvement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko convened an emergency security meeting today as pro-Russia rebels launched a new offensive in eastern Ukraine. The escalation comes amid mounting evidence suggesting direct Russian military involvement in the conflict.\n\nThe previously unaffected town of Novoazovsk, situated between Russia and the annexed Crimea Peninsula, experienced shelling just hours after a landmark meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents on Tuesday. Pro-Russian rebels reportedly took control of the town on Wednesday, with some Ukrainian forces in retreat. Access to Novoazovsk was denied to Associated Press reporters today by separatists.\n\nThe new southeastern front raises concerns that the separatists may be attempting to establish a land link between Russia and Crimea. If successful, this could provide them or Russia control over the entire Sea of Azov and the gas and mineral riches believed to be contained within. Ukraine has already lost approximately half its coastline, several major ports, and significant Black Sea mineral rights following Russia's annexation of Crimea in March.\n\nIn Mariupol, a city of 450,000 residents approximately 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the west, a Ukrainian forces brigade arrived at the airport Wednesday afternoon, while deep trenches were dug on the city's edge the previous day.\n\nThe BBC reports that the incursion could serve as a means to divert Ukrainian troops from Luhansk and Donetsk, where they have made progress against pro-Russian separatists in recent months.\n\nUkraine accused Russia this week of supplying heavy weaponry to aid pro-Russian rebels in southern Ukraine. National security spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko stated that Russian soldiers crossed as far as 30 miles beyond the border in armored personnel carriers and a truck this week.\n\nThe prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People\u2019s Republic admitted today that there are Russian servicemen fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Alexander Zakharchenko claimed there are between 3,000 and 4,000 Russian volunteers fighting with the rebels. Some of these individuals are reportedly retired Russian military personnel.\n\nAccusations of direct Russian involvement in Ukraine have prompted Western governments to impose sanctions on Russia, despite Moscow's repeated denials. Russia refers to the crisis in Ukraine as a domestic issue that must be resolved internally.\n\nThe Obama administration this week accused Russia of moving artillery and air defenses to aid pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine. \"These incursions indicate a Russian-directed counteroffensive is likely underway,\" said Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman. Psaki criticized Russia's \"unwillingness to tell the truth\" about its military's role in Ukrainian territory.\n\nInternational leaders, including those from France, Germany, and NATO, have expressed concern. \"I think there's a shift here that we may be witnessing, very recently, from largely covert, ambiguous, deniable support to what appears increasingly to be flat-out, overt and obvious [support],\" a NATO diplomat told reporters in Brussels on the condition of anonymity.\n\nNATO officials are expected to provide a briefing today on the situation in Ukraine. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande stated this week that if Russian soldiers are in Ukraine, \"it would be intolerable and unacceptable.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Russian President Vladimir Putin for clarification on the Kremlin's involvement.\n\nA UN report found that the death toll in eastern Ukraine over the past month reached at least 36 people per day. An estimated 2,200 people have died since the conflict began in April, according to the UN.",
    " Title: \"The Tight Presidential Race: A Closer Look at the Obama-Romney Deadlock\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the back-to-school season kicks off, the political landscape is heating up with the upcoming presidential election. In a recent poll, 57 percent of likely voters believe America is in decline, yet the race between President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, remains a dead heat. This article delves into the factors contributing to this unexpected tight race.\n\nAccording to the latest polls, President Obama faces significant challenges in areas such as overall job approval, handling of the economy, and government intervention. By an almost 20-point margin, respondents expressed a preference for the federal government to leave them alone rather than lend a hand. When asked whether it was fair to say Obama wants to make Americans more dependent on the government, 53 percent said yes, while only 44 percent said no.\n\nThese numbers paint a grim picture for any incumbent Democrat, particularly one whose major liabilities revolve around spending too much and intervening too much while struggling to revive the economy. However, the race remains close, and the effort to define Romney has been equally successful.\n\nThe undecided or those rejecting the major party choices reveal a group of voters who find little to like in either candidate. While Obama suffers a 12-point deficit on personal favorability among these voters, Romney's rating stands at a staggering negative 28 points.\n\nEvery re-election campaign is about answering two questions: Do we want to keep the incumbent, and is the challenger a plausible alternative? As we approach the two-week convention kick-off for the fall campaign, it is clear that Obama has failed the first question. With 74 days until the election, there is no way for the president to turn public sentiment in favor of his administration.\n\nThe Obama campaign has focused on personal attacks on Romney for nearly five months, with Vice President Joe Biden often saying, \"Don't compare us to the almighty, compare us to the alternative.\" The central emphasis of the Obama campaign has been to make Romney an unacceptable alternative. Yet, despite the relentless attacks, Romney remains competitive.\n\nRespondents in the poll were 6 points less inclined to believe Romney wanted to make the rich richer at the expense of everyone else, a charge that is the ethos of the Obama campaign, than they were the Republican charge that Obama is seeking greater government dependency. The other significant criticism of Romney is that he is more interested in political expedience than principle.\n\nThis creates a scenario in which fed-up moderates and independents might declare a pox on both houses and sit out the election. Obama has been seeking a base-versus-base election and his long, negative campaign has helped push people into their respective camps earlier than usual. The president's team believes that the power of incumbency combined with a superior turnout operation will allow them to win a narrow victory.\n\nHowever, the alarming sign for the blue team is this: The president has failed to close the voter intensity gap for month after month. Romney supporters lead Obama supporters 64 percent to 54 percent on the question of whether it is \"extremely important\" for their candidate to win. In a tie race, that would mean victory for Romney.\n\nThe next week is crucial for both candidates. For Obama, the focus is on energizing his base and getting his voters marching. For Romney, the first step came with his selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate, helping cast Romney as a serious man and a serious fiscal conservative. The effort continues today and through the next week, with Romney aiming to reintroduce himself to a crabby and skeptical electorate. The message will be one of competency, accomplishment, and steadiness. It's not sexy, but it's certainly a plausible presidential pedigree.",
    " Title: Philippines Impounds North Korean Freighter in Response to Global Sanctions Over Nuclear Test and Missile Launch\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that underscores the global community's response to North Korea's recent nuclear test and missile launch, the Philippine government has impounded a North Korean freighter, the Jin Teng, in Subic Bay. The Philippine News Agency reported that the ship's crew will be deported, according to presidential spokesman Manuel Quezon III in a radio interview.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council, in a unanimous vote this week, imposed new sanctions on North Korea in response to what it called \"violation and flagrant disregard\" of previous resolutions. The sanctions mandate that other countries should inspect cargo within or transiting through their territory, including airports, sea ports, and free trade zones, that was destined for or originating from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\nThe Jin Teng, operated by Ocean Maritime Management, is one of 31 vessels named in the U.N. resolution as being \"subject to the asset freeze.\" Documents show that all 21 of the Sierra Leone-flagged ship's crew are North Korean nationals.\n\nThe freighter arrived in Subic Bay on Thursday from Indonesia with a load of palm kernels, according to state news. Coast guardsmen found minor safety violations during an inspection, such as faulty emergency light bulbs, a lack of fire hoses, corroded air vents, and inadequate accommodations for crew.\n\nA team from the United Nations may also inspect the Jin Teng, according to Quezon. The Philippine government will report its findings to the world body.\n\nDespite these actions, North Korea has continued to escalate its threats, with leader Kim Jong Un stating on Friday that his country's \"nuclear warheads need to be ready for use at any time.\" The rhetoric comes after reports of North Korea testing a new multiple-launch rocket system and \"short-range projectiles.\"\n\nNorth Korea's nuclear ambitions and missile capabilities have long been a concern for neighboring countries and the international community. There are strong doubts that North Korea currently has the technology to mate a nuclear warhead to a missile that could travel 5,000 miles and hit the U.S. West Coast, but much is still unknown about Pyongyang's military potential.\n\nOne anti-nuclear advocate, Philip Yun, executive director of the Ploughshares Fund, believes that much of the talk is intended for internal consumption, to help Kim consolidate power, and is not proof of his military's abilities. \"For them to deliver on a threat, they have to have intent and they have to have capability. And quite frankly, I do not think they have both,\" Yun said.",
    " Title: Former President Obama's Speaking Fee for Milan Climate Change Address Remains Unknown Amidst Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe speaking fee for former President Barack Obama's upcoming climate change address in Milan remains a mystery, with neither his team nor the hosting organization, Seeds & Chips, disclosing the amount. This secrecy has sparked speculation, with one publication estimating that Obama could potentially receive $3.2 million for the event.\n\nThe event, which is a summit on food innovation aimed at addressing climate change, is scheduled for May 8-11. Tickets for the event, priced at 850 euros ($925), have been sold for 3,500 tickets in total. However, this leaves open the question of how much Obama is being paid.\n\nFollowing the event, The Express updated its initial story, omitting any mention of a speaking fee. Representatives for Obama did not respond to Fox News' request for comment, while Michela Gelati, a spokesperson for Seeds & Chips, stated they did not have the information.\n\nThe speculation surrounding Obama's potential payday comes after he drew criticism for two lucrative speaking engagements that seemed to contradict his image as a champion of the 99%. In late April, it was reported that Obama would receive $400,000 for a talk on healthcare at a Wall Street conference run by Cantor Fitzgerald, a major Wall Street firm.\n\nEric Schultz, a spokesman for Obama, defended the former president, stating, \"With regard to this or any speech involving Wall Street sponsors, I'd just point out that in 2008 Barack Obama raised more money from Wall Street than any candidate in history -- and still went on to successfully pass and implement the toughest reforms on Wall Street since FDR.\"\n\nObama also reportedly received $400,000 for his appearance at the A&E Networks advertising upfront at The Pierre Hotel in New York City in early April.\n\nWhile Obama's speaking fees may be common for former presidents, he has faced criticism for allegedly using his tax-exempt Obama Foundation as a money generator. The foundation is in place to raise money for his presidential library, but critics warn that the operation is starting to resemble the controversial Clinton Foundation, which took in tens of millions of dollars and sparked \"pay-to-play\" accusations.\n\nIn an effort to avoid such comparisons, Obama stated in January that he would not accept contributions from for-profit entities, federal lobbyists, foreign nationals or agents while in office.\n\nDespite the criticism, it is not uncommon for former presidents to earn substantial speaking fees after leaving the Oval Office. Harry Truman refused to give speeches for money and called the practice exploitative, but Gerald Ford, the first president known to take advantage of the speaking circuit after leaving office, earned as much as $40,000 per speech after leaving office in 1977. Bill Clinton, who normally charges between $250,000 and $500,000 per engagement, was paid a whopping $750,000 to give a talk in Hong Kong in 2011, while George W. Bush has reportedly made between $20 million and $35 million in speaking fees since leaving office in 2009. Shortly after leaving office in 1989, Ronald Reagan was paid around $2 million to go on a speaking tour of Japan.",
    " Title: Harry Reid Plots 2016 Reelection Bid Amidst Republican Eagerness for 2016 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview last week, the 73-year-old Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, declared his intention to run for reelection in 2016. The Nevada Senator, who has been a target of Republican ire for his inflammatory rhetoric and hardball tactics during the government shutdown, is reportedly ramping up his campaign organization and preparing for the anticipated GOP onslaught.\n\nReid's plans for the 2016 elections are more than three years away, but he is already seeking commitments from aides to stay with him through that year. He is spending more time fundraising, from New York to Southern California, and has issued a warning to potential GOP opponent, Governor Brian Sandoval of Nevada, who may run midterm if reelected next year.\n\nReid's polarizing stance during the shutdown fight has kept Democrats together, a challenging feat. Removing him from his position as the powerful majority leader has become a leading Republican campaign pitch in the run-up to the 2014 midterms. However, whether Reid is simply posturing to avoid being viewed as a lame duck remains to be seen. He could ultimately change his mind and decide not to run for a sixth term, or his calculus could change if Republicans regain control of the Senate in 2014 and he loses the majority leader title, which he has held for more than six years.\n\nReid is optimistic about Democrats' prospects in 2014, even believing the party may gain seats next year. He attributes the Republicans' handling of the government shutdown as weakening the GOP. When asked if he was bluffing about running in 2016, Reid responded, \"I guarantee you that I haven't spent all that money [just] to show strength during the shutdown. To have a campaign operation that I have is not easy.\"\n\nReid's fundraising efforts have been successful, with his campaign and political action committee account raising over $600,000 in the third quarter, more than the $407,000 it pulled in during a similar period in 2010. At a similar point in the last cycle, Reid had raised $5.5 million, compared to the $5.6 million he had raised at the same time in 2010.\n\nReid's reputation as a polarizing figure has grown due to his constant derision of the Republican party, using words like \"extreme\" and \"anarchists\" to describe conservative Republicans in the House and Senate. He has been criticized for his tactics during the shutdown fight, which have further solidified his status as the GOP's scourge.\n\nReid's refusal to negotiate with Republicans until they agree to pass a Senate bill to keep the government open until mid-November, and his refusal to schedule votes on House GOP bills to fund popular agencies and programs one at a time, have been met with frustration from the GOP.\n\nRepresentative Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) described Reid as \"the most uncompromising politician I've encountered in the past five years. He's the guy more than anybody that thwarts progress.\" When asked about his rhetoric, Reid seemed to acknowledge his reputation for gaffes but was unapologetic about his tough talk.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Market Shows Strongest Growth in Two Years, Yet Unemployment Rate Decreases Due to Labor Force Exit\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. job market demonstrated its strongest growth in two years in April, with the addition of 288,000 jobs, according to the Department of Labor's report released on Friday. This figure surpassed economists' predictions, causing stocks to rise, albeit temporarily, before falling back. The unemployment rate decreased to 6.3%, down from 6.7% in March.\n\nThe severe winter weather had previously impeded various economic indicators, including the housing market, retail sales, and manufacturing. However, the jobs numbers for February and March were revised higher, indicating that the economy has moved past the winter slump.\n\nDespite the lower unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate tells a more discouraging story. The rate, derived from a survey of households, shows a decrease in the number of Americans joining the labor force and a decrease in the number reporting employment. This decrease in participation is not due to discouraged workers leaving the labor force, according to a Department of Labor spokesperson, but rather to fewer young people entering the job market for the first time and more seniors retiring and staying retired.\n\nThis trend could indicate a decrease in the number of young people entering the job market and an increase in the number of seniors retiring. Additionally, participation also fell among the prime working-age population, which is a concerning sign, according to Diane Swonk, chief economist for Mesirow Financial.\n\nEconomists caution against reading too much into a single month's data. The overall picture remains the same. As Jason Furman, top economic adviser to President Obama, wrote in a White House blog post, \"The employment data can fluctuate from month to month, and while this month's report happens to be above expectations, it is still broadly consistent with the recent trends we have been seeing in the labor market.\"\n\nGiven the millions of jobs lost during the financial crisis, even solid hiring is not enough to quickly re-employ the vast number of unemployed Americans. The jobs recovery has been ongoing for four years, and long-term unemployment remains elevated, with 3.5 million people out of work for six months or more. Economists estimate that it could take at least another two years until the job market returns to its pre-recession health, when the unemployment rate was around 4% to 5%.\n\nThe positive aspect of the recovery is that it is now broad-based across many industries. For example, professional and business services, which added 75,000 jobs in April, have seen over 660,000 jobs added over the past 12 months. Many of these jobs are likely to be office jobs paying mid- to high-level wages. Retail, restaurants and bars, traditionally low-wage industries, have also seen strong job growth, and blue-collar industries like manufacturing and construction are on the upswing.\n\nThe only major sector that continues to cut jobs is the federal government, which has reduced its workforce by 83,000 positions over the past 12 months.",
    " Title: Sen. Dianne Feinstein Defends Hillary Clinton's Cognitive Abilities and Endorses Her Foreign Policy Expertise\n\nIn an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, expressed support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, should she decide to run for president in 2016. While not issuing a formal endorsement, Feinstein praised Clinton as a top foreign policy expert and a strong leader.\n\nWhen asked about recent comments by Karl Rove, a prominent Republican strategist, regarding Clinton's cognitive abilities, Feinstein called Rove's remarks a \"pathetic\" attempt to sway voters. When pressed on the legitimacy of Rove's questions about Clinton's health, Feinstein stated, \"That she has sustained brain damage? That's legitimate?... In my view, she's in the prime of her political life. She has all the elements of a good leader, plus the fact\u2014and this is not to be underestimated\u2014she is enormously attractive to people. She carries the torch for women, who are the majority of votes in this country, very strongly and holds it very high. I think people respond to her.\"\n\nFeinstein also referenced Clinton's upcoming book as evidence of her foreign policy background. \"I think the book will likely carry a good bit of her thinking on various big issues, certainly foreign policy, certainly the Secretary of State, and we would have someone in the White House who would have a real background in foreign policy,\" Feinstein said. She added, \"I think that's critical at this point in the world with Russia expanding, with Africa becoming real problems from a terror point of view, and on and on and on.\"",
    " Title: Testimonies Reveal Turbulent Times at the White House and the Ukrainian Embassy in 2019\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of testimonies, several key figures have shed light on the tumultuous events that unfolded at the White House and the Ukrainian embassy in March 2019. The situation, initially focused on security, economy, justice, and support for Ukrainian democratic resistance, was overshadowed by a political agenda promoted by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and a group of officials with direct access to the White House.\n\nDuring the testimonies, it was stated that some members of the committee seemed to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against the United States in 2016, with the suggestion that Ukraine may have been responsible instead. This narrative was described as a fictional one, perpetuated and propagated by the Russian security services. It was emphasized that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked democratic institutions in 2016.\n\nThe hold on security assistance was lifted, but concerns persisted about unfulfilled requests, such as a meeting with the president in the Oval Office. It was suggested that this desire for such meetings continues to the present day.\n\nThe testimonies also revealed a strained relationship between Ambassador Sondland and some of his colleagues. Ambassador Sondland was reportedly involved in a domestic political errand, while the National Security Council was tasked with national security foreign policy. This divergence was a source of frustration for some, including the speaker, who expressed his concerns to Ambassador Sondland.\n\nThe testimonies also addressed the accusations against Colonel Vindman, suggesting he has dual loyalties. In response, the speaker, as an immigrant himself, expressed his belief that such accusations are deeply unfair.\n\nRegarding Giuliani's role, it was stated that he was compared to a hand grenade by Ambassador Bolton, indicating that his actions and statements could backfire.\n\nThe testimonies concluded with a call for unity and truth, emphasizing the importance of the testimonies in ensuring the American people can make informed choices in the 2020 presidential election without fear.",
    " Title: YouTube Investing in The Young Turks' TYT Academy for Digital-First Local News Creation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards fostering digital-first local news, Google-owned YouTube has announced an investment in The Young Turks (TYT) to launch the TYT Academy. The investment, reported to be in the mid-six-figures range, is part of YouTube's $25 million commitment to news efforts, which is a part of the $300 million Google News Initiative announced in 2018.\n\nThe TYT Academy, a two-track online course, aims to engage everyday people in digital media, empowering them to report on their local communities. The course features a two-track video series, with each track containing eight videos. Users will take short quizzes along the way, and must pass a final exam after completing each track to earn a TYT Academy certificate.\n\nThe first track focuses on journalism tactics and responsibilities, while the second track delves into best practices for online video production across various online platforms, not just YouTube. The course is currently in a trial period, with plans to expand it more broadly after testing it with 10-15 individuals.\n\nSteven Oh, TYT\u2019s Chief Business Officer and the creator of TYT Academy, clarified in a phone call with \u2588\u2588\u2588 that TYT is \"not interested in cranking out journalists who share our political viewpoint whatsoever.\"\n\nThis investment comes as Facebook has also invested in online news courses from publishers. In December, \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that Facebook would be funding an online deepfakes course for newsrooms by Reuters. The videos for this course, which have been online for about two months, appear to be nonpartisan. However, it's notable that YouTube is investing in a course from TYT, which has a progressive bent.\n\nFacebook has stated that it will include partisan publishers like Breitbart in its news tab, but it won't necessarily pay Breitbart. The company has not released a list of all the publishers who are being paid.\n\nMeanwhile, Young Turks' founder Cenk Uygur is running to fill the seat vacated by former Rep. Katie Hill. This move by TYT underscores the platform's commitment to engaging in local politics and news, in addition to its digital media courses.",
    " Title: Idaho Wedding Chapel Owners Face Legal Action for Refusing to Perform Same-sex Weddings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events that has sparked controversy and raised concerns about religious freedom, two Christian ministers in Idaho are facing potential legal action for refusing to perform same-sex weddings at their wedding chapel. The Hitching Post Wedding Chapel in Coeur d\u2019Alene, owned by Donald and Evelyn Knapp, is at the center of a lawsuit filed in federal court on Friday.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the Alliance Defending Freedom, claims that the city is requiring the Knapps to either perform same-sex weddings or face jail time and fines of up to $1,000. The wedding chapel is registered as a religious corporation limited to performing \"one-man-one-woman marriages as defined by the Holy Bible.\" However, it is also registered as a for-profit business, not as a church or place of worship, and city officials argue that this means the owners must comply with a local nondiscrimination ordinance.\n\nThe ordinance, passed last year, prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and applies to housing, employment, and public accommodation. City Attorney Warren Wilson reportedly told local news outlets that the Hitching Post Wedding Chapel would likely be subject to the ordinance. If the Knapps refused to perform same-sex weddings, they could face fines of up to $1,000 and jail time of up to 180 days.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Wilson confirmed the ministers would not be exempt from the ordinance because the Hitching Post is a business and not a church. The city has not responded to requests for an interview regarding the matter.\n\nThe controversy came to a head last week when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit allowed same-sex marriages to commence in Idaho on Oct. 15. Two days later, the Hitching Post received a call inquiring about a same-sex wedding ceremony, which they declined, putting them in violation of the law.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to protect the Knapps' freedom to adhere to their faith as pastors, as guaranteed by the First Amendment. The Alliance Defending Freedom also filed a temporary restraining order to stop the city from enforcing the ordinance.\n\nThe incident in Coeur d'Alene comes on the heels of a similar controversy in Houston, where five Christian pastors were issued subpoenas demanding sermons dealing with homosexuality and gender identity.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, called it \"open season on Americans who refuse to bow to the government's redefinition of marriage.\" He added, \"Americans are witnesses to the reality that redefining marriage is less about the marriage altar and more about fundamentally altering the freedoms of the other 98 percent of Americans.\"\n\nThe incidents in Houston and Coeur d'Alene are the latest examples of a disturbing trend in the culture war, with direct attacks on clergy. \"Government officials are making clear they will use their government power to punish those who oppose the advances of homosexual activists,\" Perkins said.\n\nThe Knapps' lawsuit comes as the latest example of the ongoing debate over religious freedom and same-sex marriage in the United States. The incidents in Houston and Coeur d'Alene raise questions about the balance between religious freedom and nondiscrimination, and the role of government in regulating religious practices.",

Known as Mrs. Ronald Reagan, she was a close confidant and played a significant role in her husband's career and presidency.\n\nIn a statement, Senator Marco Rubio wrote, \"Today our nation mourns the loss of Nancy Reagan, a true example of integrity and grace.\" The world may have never seen the man who won the Cold War if it wasn't for the driving force of Nancy in his life.\n\nNancy Reagan and Ronald Reagan met in 1949 when Ronald was the head of the Screen Actors Guild. They married three years later, and their bond was deep, serving as a driving force behind Ronald Reagan's relentless and successful political career.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 1994, Nancy became his primary caretaker until his death in 2004.

    " Title: Democrats Face Criticism Over Pay Equity as They Promote Equal Pay Day\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a show of solidarity for equal pay for women, Democrats have marked Tuesday as National Equal Pay Day, symbolizing the number of days a woman needs to work in a given year to earn what men earned in the previous year. However, the move has sparked criticism as data reveals that both President Obama and leading Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton have not consistently practiced pay equity within their own administrations.\n\nPresident Obama, in a proclamation, highlighted the wage gap, stating that on average, full-time working women earn 78 cents for every dollar earned by men. He emphasized that this disparity puts women at a career-long disadvantage and negatively impacts families, communities, and the economy as a whole.\n\nHowever, an analysis of White House salaries from last July revealed a 13% pay gap between male and female staffers, with women earning less on average. In 2009, women at the White House were paid an average of $72,700, while male staffers earned $82,000. By 2014, the gap had narrowed slightly, with women staffers earning $78,400 compared to the average male salaries of $88,600.\n\nSimilarly, during her time in the U.S. Senate, Hillary Clinton's office paid women 72 cents for each dollar paid to men. The Washington Free Beacon's analysis found the median annual salary for female staffers was $15,708.38 less than the median salary for men between 2002 and 2008, a gender gap of 28%.\n\nWhile Clinton's supporters argue that she has been a consistent advocate for equal-pay legislation, her critics point to her own record in this regard. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has attacked GOP presidential candidates on their pay-equity policies, but the party itself faces scrutiny over its own practices.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz stated, \"Democrats are proud to fight for equal pay every single day.\" The DNC has also criticized Republican presidential candidates for their perceived lack of commitment to pay equity or for enacting policies deemed unfavorable to female workers.\n\nIn Congress, Democrats are proposing the Paycheck Fairness Act, which aims to allow employees to share information about their pay and file lawsuits against employers. On the Republican side, a coalition of senators, led by Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska, has offered an amendment to the bill that would prohibit retaliation against employees for discussing salaries and provide grants to states to create industry-led partnerships to address pay disparities.\n\nThe debate over pay equity continues to be a contentious issue, with both parties emphasizing their commitment to addressing the wage gap while facing criticism for their own records on the matter.",
    " Title: House Approves Syrian and Iraqi Refugee Bill: Bipartisan Support, Veto-Proof Majority\n\nThe House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday that aims to block Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the United States unless they undergo stringent background checks. The bill, which saw near unanimous support from Republicans and broad support from Democrats, could potentially collide with President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats.\n\nThe bill, known as the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, requires the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence to certify that any refugee from Syria or Iraq is not a threat to the security of the United States before being allowed to settle in the country.\n\nThe bill's passage marks a significant loss for the White House, with the House Democratic Caucus voting against Obama on a similar scale as the trade bill in mid-June. The measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate, with Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) stating that the Syria bill will not reach Obama's desk.\n\nThe bill's supporters argue that the current vetting system is insufficient, while opponents contend that the new bill is unnecessary and burdensome. The final vote was 289-137, with many House Democrats signaling early Thursday that there was not broad support in their caucus to take a tough vote on national security.\n\nIn response to the bill's passage, the White House dispatched Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to Capitol Hill to speak with Democrats. However, their efforts to persuade Democrats to oppose the Republican-authored bill were not successful.\n\nRepresentative Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY) stated, \"It is offensive to me that we would stigmatize refugees...but if you read the bill what you find is that you have a pretty simple certification process sitting on top of an existing and extensive screening process that most of us believe works pretty well.\"\n\nThe bill's passage is a rebuke of President Obama by House Democrats who felt that the administration failed to make a compelling case as to why they should vote against the Republican-authored bill when it was bad politics to do so. The vote, coupled with the Iranian nuclear agreement bill from September, also shows that Republicans plan to make national security a key issue in the 2016 elections.",
    " Title: John Kasich's 2016 Presidential Campaign: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 Republican primary race, Ohio Governor John Kasich's campaign, while not particularly successful, bore some resemblance to former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman's unsuccessful 2012 bid. Both candidates shared the same campaign strategist, John Weaver, and followed a similar playbook, albeit with varying results.\n\nKasich's strategy seemed promising at the onset, particularly in the early primary state of New Hampshire, where he placed second to Donald Trump. However, his heavy focus on New Hampshire left him with limited infrastructure for the rest of the campaign, resulting in a non-existent presence in the South Carolina primary. By the time the campaign reached his home state, Kasich was effectively out of the running, winning only Ohio. He ended the campaign with fewer delegates than Senator Marco Rubio, who dropped out on March 15.\n\nKasich's campaign platform revolved around his image as a traditional conservative who could also win swing states like Ohio. His policy focus, however, was largely centered on his advocacy for a balanced-budget amendment, a promise tied to his work on balancing the national budget during his tenure in the U.S. House in the 1990s. The extent of his involvement in this work is a subject of debate.\n\nKasich's policy stances on other issues, such as his acceptance of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act in his capacity as governor, were met with criticism from conservatives. His justification for this decision, rooted in faith, further alienated him from the Republican base.\n\nKasich's image as a friendly, approachable politician was not universally accepted by his former colleagues, who recalled a more irritable, angry Kasich. The disconnect between this image and the candidate that Republican primary voters wanted in 2016, a more volatile, unpredictable nominee, ultimately proved to be Kasich's undoing.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Faces Challenges in Meeting 2016 Obamacare Enrollment Target\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the third round of enrollment for the Affordable Care Act's (Obamacare) health insurance marketplaces approaches, President Obama faces a significant challenge in meeting the 21 million enrollee target set in budget projections for 2016. As of June, the Department of Health and Human Services reported 9.9 million customers who have purchased plans through the federal HealthCare.gov portal and state-run exchanges, which is less than half of the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) 2016 projection.\n\nIndustry analysts have described the CBO's estimate for next year as \"overly optimistic\" and a \"stretch,\" suggesting that it will take more time for the law to attract the necessary number of people onto the web-based marketplaces. Elizabeth Carpenter, a vice president at Avalere Health, a D.C.-based consultancy, stated, \"Given where things stand, the ramp-up of enrollment may be slower than initially anticipated.\"\n\nOpen enrollment for the third round of Obamacare's exchanges begins on November 1. The administration is counting on winning over millions of customers who did not sign up during the first two years but may be pressured by the increasing penalties associated with the \"individual mandate\" tax, which assesses a penalty on those who forgo health insurance. Rachel Klein, director of organizational strategy at Families USA, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable health care, noted, \"It is definitely something that people pay attention to.\"\n\nThe tax during the first year was $95 or 1% of income above the filing threshold, a relatively minor penalty. This year, the penalty will be $325 or 2% of income, and by 2016 it will be $695 or 2.5% of income. Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, stated, \"The substantial increase in penalties under the individual mandate next year is a big wild card. We're in uncharted territory here about how effective these bigger penalties will be in nudging people to get insured.\"\n\nThe individual mandate was included in the Affordable Care Act of 2010 to ensure that enough healthy Americans signed up, spreading out the costs for higher-risk customers. The Supreme Court upheld the mandate in 2012 as an appropriate use of Congress' taxing power. However, congressional Republicans are still intent on scrapping the health care law, and may use a fast-track budget procedure known as \"reconciliation\" to take a swing at it. GOP leaders say they may not be able to eviscerate the law through the budget, but repealing the individual mandate is \"definitely on the table.\"\n\nEven as it struggles to meet the 2016 enrollment projection, the Obama administration is on track on other measures, including a CBO estimate that 17 million fewer people lack insurance this year because of the health care law. However, the administration has begun to set more modest goals for exchange enrollment, ignoring the CBO's guess of 12 million for 2015 and setting the mark at 9.1 million enrollees. The agency says it is doing its own evaluation of the marketplace and will likely announce its enrollment targets for 2016 before signups begin in November.\n\nIn conclusion, the Obama administration faces a significant challenge in meeting the 2016 enrollment target for Obamacare. The CBO's estimate for next year's enrollment is \"overly optimistic,\" and industry analysts suggest that it will take more time for the law to attract the necessary number of people onto the web-based marketplaces. The administration is counting on winning over millions of customers who did not sign up during the first two years but may be pressured by the increasing penalties associated with the individual mandate tax. The future of the health care law remains uncertain, as congressional Republicans continue to push for its repeal.",
    " Title: Republican Opposition to Obama's Cuba Policy: A New Roadblock in U.S.-Cuba Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Barack Obama's plan to normalize relations with Cuba has faced a familiar hurdle as Republicans on Capitol Hill have begun exploring ways to impede any changes to the U.S.-Cuba relationship.\n\nJust hours after Obama announced a prisoner swap with the Cuban government for two Americans as the start of a new relationship with the communist country, Republicans started informally discussing strategies to obstruct any alterations to the U.S.-Cuba relationship. Proposed measures include denying Obama funds to reopen an embassy in Havana, stalling the nomination of a potential ambassador, voting down a bill to open up travel more widely, and ignoring requests from the White House to lift a decades-old embargo.\n\nWith Republicans set to control the Senate next year, they would be in a strong position to implement some of their plans. However, even if they cannot fully halt Obama's initiatives, as the president has some authority to act without Congress, the dispute will provide another opportunity for the president's Hill rivals, including 2016 likely contenders Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, to continue questioning his use of executive action \u2013 a theme Republicans had already planned to take on next year regarding Obama's moves on immigration and Obamacare.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) expressed his opposition on Twitter Wednesday, stating, \"I will do all in my power to block the use of funds to open an embassy in Cuba. Normalizing relations with Cuba is a bad idea at a bad time.\"\n\nIn a White House address on Wednesday, Obama announced that he would direct Secretary of State John Kerry to review Cuba's place on a list of state sponsors of terrorism, reestablish an embassy in Havana, and ease travel restrictions. Obama also stated that the U.S. would increase remittance levels, expand commercial sales, and exports.\n\n\"We will end an outdated approach that for decades has failed to advance our interests,\" Obama said. \"Neither the American nor the Cuban people are well-served by a rigid policy that is rooted in events that took place before most of us were born.\"\n\nRepublicans will control the Senate starting in January, meaning they will have the power to block presidential nominations. Already, a number of influential Republicans vocal on foreign affairs, including Graham, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Rubio (R-Fla.), and Cruz have stated their staunch opposition to Obama's plans.\n\nObama also called on Congress to pursue legislation that would lift the 50-year embargo against goods and travel to Cuba. The embargo, launched by President John F. Kennedy, is not solidified by decades of congressional legislation \u2013 a fact Obama alluded to in his remarks.\n\n\"The embargo that has been imposed for decades is now codified in legislation. As these changes unfold, I look forward to engaging Congress in an honest and serious debate about lifting the embargo,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Speaker John Boehner stated he would not allow any Cuban-U.S. relations to be revisited in the House.\n\n\"Relations with the Castro regime should not be revisited, let alone normalized, until the Cuban people enjoy freedom \u2013 and not one second sooner. There is no'new course' here, only another in a long line of mindless concessions to a dictatorship that brutalizes its people and schemes with our enemies,\" the Ohio Republican said.\n\nIncoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would defer the upper chamber's response to Cuba policy changes to Rubio, who criticized Obama for threatening U.S. national security concerns.\n\nAlready, some Republicans are casting doubt on if the Obama administration has the legal authority to roll back some travel restrictions and allow increased numbers of Cuban cigars to be brought into the U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) said action by Obama \"may be in direct violation of Helms-Burton that specifically states that all political prisoners must be released and free and fair elections must be held before establishing a diplomatic relationship.\"\n\nThe incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tennessee Republican Bob Corker, gave few details on Wednesday on what his panel would do to halt any of Obama's proposals.\n\n\"The new U.S. policy announced by the administration is no doubt sweeping, and as of now, there is no real understanding as to what changes the Cuban government is prepared to make. We will be closely examining the implications of these major policy changes in the next Congress,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats were mixed on their response to Obama's plans. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the current chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, was highly critical of Obama's proposals. However, House Minority Nancy Pelosi hailed Obama's \"new chapter.\"\n\n\"It is clear that policy of isolating Cuba is serving neither the interests of the American people nor the democratic aspirations of the Cubans. We must acknowledge our policy towards Cuba is a relic of a bygone era that weakens our leadership in the Americas and has not advanced freedom and prosperity in Cuba,\" Pelosi said.",
    " Title: Analyzing the Impact of Obamacare on Federal Budget: A Long-term Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has been a subject of intense political debate since its inception in 2010, with claims ranging from it being a significant contributor to deficit reduction to a potential budgetary burden. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) initially estimated that the ACA would reduce deficits by over $100 billion in the first decade and by half a percent of economic growth in the second decade, potentially reducing deficits by more than $1 trillion.\n\nHowever, the CBO's estimate is contingent on the law being implemented exactly as written, which may not be the case. The ACA's implementation has already seen several changes, and more are being proposed, which could impact its deficit-reduction potential. For instance, there is a push to repeal the ACA's tax on medical devices, a move that could result in a loss of $30 billion over the next decade.\n\nMoreover, adhering to various cost-containment provisions in the law could prove challenging, according to Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a deficit watchdog group. If lawmakers continue to make changes to the law, there is a risk of adding to deficits rather than reducing them.\n\nA long-range simulation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggests that if key provisions intended to restrain spending growth in Medicare and health insurance subsidies are phased out, deficits could increase by 0.7% of GDP over the next 75 years. This increase would primarily be due to increased spending on Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and subsidies offered on the health insurance exchanges.\n\nThe impact of Obamacare on the federal budget remains uncertain, as it is a complex law with various provisions that phase in and out over time. The growth in national health spending, of which federal spending is a significant part, has fallen to a record low rate. While part of this slowing is attributed to the ACA, the exact extent is unclear. The growth rate is expected to rise in the next few years as more people become insured under Obamacare.\n\nThe success of the new health insurance exchanges in attracting a diverse pool of enrollees and generating enough competition to provide affordable health care for most Americans remains to be seen. What is encouraging, according to Gordon, are the changes that hospitals, doctors, and insurance companies are making to slow cost growth. These changes reflect a shift towards a value-based health care system.\n\nHowever, Gordon's pessimism stems from the potential for Congress to interfere with these positive changes. The long-term fiscal impact of Obamacare will depend on how lawmakers choose to implement and adjust the law.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Calls for Roy Moore to Step Aside Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday urged GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore to withdraw from the Alabama Senate race following a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him.\n\n\"I think he should step aside,\" McConnell said during a tax reform press conference in Louisville, Ky., when asked about the calls from his Senate colleagues for Moore to leave the race.\n\nThe Washington Post published a story last week detailing allegations that Moore pursued relationships with teenage girls, including an account from Leigh Corfman, now 53, who said she had a sexual encounter with Moore in 1979, when she was 14 years old and he was 32. The report also included accounts from three other women who said Moore attempted to court them around that time, when they were between 16 and 18 years old.\n\nMoore, in a tweet early Monday afternoon, responded to McConnell's remarks by saying, \"He has failed conservatives and must be replaced.\"\n\nEven if Moore withdraws from the Senate race \u2014 something he has said he will not do \u2014 Republicans are stuck with his name remaining on the ballot. The deadline for the party to remove Moore's name from the ballot passed in October, though Republicans could mount a write-in challenge. Republicans have also floated trying to move back the December special election date.\n\nMcConnell said Monday that the party is exploring a write-in bid, though he declined to say specifically who would be the candidate. \"That's an option we're looking at, whether or not there is someone who could mount a write-in successfully,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked if Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who Moore defeated in the GOP primary runoff, would be the write-in candidate, McConnell added, \"We'll see.\"\n\nMoore has denied wrongdoing and threatened to sue The Washington Post, arguing the story is politically motivated and aimed at damaging him ahead of the December special election.\n\nSenate Republicans, including Orrin Hatch (Utah) and Susan Collins (Maine), have called on Moore to step aside if the allegations are true. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who leads the Senate GOP campaign arm, later called on the Senate to expel Moore if he wins the special election.\n\nAlabama Republicans have publicly defended Moore and warned that if he left the race it would hand the Senate seat to Democratic candidate Doug Jones. Alabama Republican Party Chairwoman Terry Lathan also pushed back against a write-in campaign, saying it would be a \"serious error\" for any current elected GOP official or candidate to endorse another party's candidate, an independent, a third party, or a write-in candidate in a general election.\n\nMoore is using the blowback from Republican lawmakers in his fundraising appeals, saying that \"establishment Republicans are colluding with the Obama-Clinton Machine.\"\n\nRepublicans have a slim 52-seat majority in the Senate, and losing the Alabama seat to a Democrat would likely make it harder for McConnell to get major legislation through the chamber.",
    " Title: Political Divide on Foreign Policy: A Closer Look at the 2016 Presidential Debate and ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks, the political landscape in the United States has been marked by a stark contrast in foreign policy perspectives between the Democratic and Republican parties. The debate, particularly on the issue of ISIS, has been a focal point of the 2016 presidential race.\n\nDuring the Paris attacks, then-President Barack Obama described ISIS as \"contained,\" a statement that was met with criticism. In the following days, some liberals argued that the attacks in Paris demonstrated the success of Obama's strategy, as ISIS was forced to lash out to gain attention. This perspective, however, was not widely shared.\n\nEarlier this year, while still in office, President Obama described global warming as the greatest threat to humanity. This view was echoed by Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders during Saturday night's Democratic debate, where he reaffirmed his belief that global warming is the root cause of terrorism in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Martin O'Malley expressed his intention to bring 60,000 Syrian refugees into the country, despite the fact that some of these refugees have been linked to the Paris attacks.\n\nThe White House Deputy National Security Advisor has confirmed that the refugee importation will proceed as planned. The Republican Party, on the other hand, has been criticizing this decision, with the American people seemingly favoring a more aggressive stance against ISIS.\n\nThe Republican Party has traditionally struggled in domestic policy elections, but in foreign policy, they have found a stronghold. The American public appears to want a leader who is willing to take decisive action against terrorists, without being overly idealistic. The Democrats, in contrast, have been criticized for their perceived naivety and delusional approach to foreign policy.\n\nHillary Clinton, a Democratic candidate, has faced criticism for her foreign policy proposals. As John Podhoretz noted, her policy solutions seem to be a jumble of contradictory platitudes. She has stated that ISIS must be \"rooted out,\" implicitly criticizing Obama's strategy of containment. Yet, she also argued that ISIS cannot be an American fight, American leadership is essential, but the United States does not bear the bulk of the responsibility.\n\nIn a surprising turn, Clinton places the responsibility for the Syrian crisis on Syria's dictator, Bashar al-Assad, and the Iraqis, rather than on ISIS itself. This stance has been met with criticism, as Assad has been responsible for the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of his own people and is a key player in the refugee crisis.\n\nThe political divide on foreign policy between the two major parties is stark, with the Republican Party advocating for a more aggressive stance against ISIS, and the Democrats focusing on global warming and refugee resettlement. The American public will have to decide which approach they believe is best for the country in the upcoming elections.",
    " Title: A Milestone Reached: 100 Women in Congress, Yet Inequality Persists\n\nArticle:\n\nTuesday's midterm elections marked a significant milestone in American politics, as the number of women in Congress will reach 100 for the first time in the nation's history. However, this milestone is somewhat overshadowed by the fact that more than 80% of the country's federal legislators are still men.\n\nThe increase in female representation will be approximately 1%, a figure that falls short of the celebration that one might expect. The low number of women in political power in Washington should be a cause for concern, as it is far lower than in most advanced democracies.\n\nAccording to Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, women tend to enter politics because they want to solve a problem or address a policy issue, while men often run for political careers. This difference in motivation could be a factor in the underrepresentation of women in Congress.\n\nThe article highlights the challenges women face in politics, including the need to raise vast sums of money, the later entry into politics, and the difficulty in building power and recruiting other women into the field. Incumbents almost always win, preserving the status quo and, consequently, the gender imbalance.\n\nIt is important to note that when women do run, they win in similar numbers as men. Once in office, women tend to function more as consensus builders than men do, and there is growing evidence that women are more effective at building bipartisan support for legislation.\n\nThe article also highlights the firsts achieved by women in Tuesday's elections, such as Joni Ernst, the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate, and Mia Love, the first black woman ever elected to Congress as a member of the Republican Party.\n\nThe story of women in American politics is one of persistent and very-slowly-eroding inequality. To break this pattern, more women need to run on both parties. Each victory is a sign to other women that politics is a field where they can succeed, and, as it happens, success for women would give the entire country, Democrats and Republicans, a real reason to celebrate.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Book \"What Happened\" Draws Controversy and Comparisons to Past Political Moments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn her new book, \"What Happened,\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recounts her experience in the 2016 presidential election, including a controversial moment during a debate with Donald Trump. Clinton describes an uncomfortable encounter with Trump, where he allegedly followed her closely, invading her personal space.\n\nThe book, which spans 512 pages, offers insights into Clinton's perspective on the election, but not without controversy. One of the most debated sections of the book is Clinton's recollection of a debate moment where she and Trump shared a small stage. Clinton describes the moment as \"incredibly uncomfortable,\" with Trump \"literally breathing down [her] neck.\"\n\nThe book has sparked discussions about Clinton's response to the situation, with some criticizing her for not standing up to Trump more assertively. Clinton, however, defends her decision to remain calm and composed, citing a \"lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw [her] off.\"\n\nThe book has also drawn comparisons to a similar moment in presidential debate history, when Al Gore approached George W. Bush during a debate in 2000. Gore's approach was met with laughter from the audience, while Clinton's moment with Trump has been met with criticism and debate.\n\nIn addition to the debate moment, Clinton's book has been criticized for its focus on personal anecdotes and self-reflection, rather than offering a more in-depth analysis of the election and its aftermath. The book has also been criticized for its tone, with some describing it as self-pitying and self-aggrandizing.\n\nDespite the criticism, Clinton's book has been a bestseller and has sparked conversations about gender, politics, and the role of the media in shaping public opinion. The book has also drawn attention to the challenges faced by women in politics, with Clinton discussing the sexism and misogyny she experienced during the campaign.\n\nIn a chapter entitled \"On Being a Woman in Politics,\" Clinton references a speech by David Foster Wallace, in which he discusses human nature and the challenges of recognizing reality. Clinton uses Wallace's speech to discuss the challenges of recognizing sexism in politics, but some have criticized her use of the speech as a way to deflect blame from her own actions and decisions during the campaign.\n\nOverall, Clinton's book has been a polarizing and controversial addition to the political discourse, with some praising it for its honesty and insight, while others criticize it for its tone and focus on personal anecdotes. The book has sparked conversations about gender, politics, and the role of the media in shaping public opinion, but has also raised questions about Clinton's leadership and her ability to move past the 2016 election.",
    " Title: Unbiased Analysis: Quijano's Moderation of Vice Presidential Debate Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe vice presidential debate on Tuesday night at Longwood University was marked by a noticeable bias in the moderation, according to conservative critics. CBS anchor Elaine Quijano, who presided over the debate, was accused of favoring Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine and interrupting Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence more frequently.\n\nQuijano's moderation style was criticized for being heavily weighted towards Kaine, with Pence receiving tough questions only 8 times compared to Kaine's single question in the entire debate. The New York Times acknowledged this bias, stating, \"Elaine Quijano, the moderator, helped Mr. Kaine along, opening one question with a recitation of Mr. Pence's statements.\"\n\nThe debate began with Quijano asking Kaine about the trustworthiness of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, a question that was not posed to Pence. However, the rest of the debate was dominated by Kaine's interruptions and Quijano's attempts to control the conversation.\n\nConservatives on social media praised Pence's performance, with The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza listing Pence among the debate's \"winners.\" Even MSNBC's Chris Matthews, known for his pro-Democratic leanings, admitted that Pence was \"eloquent,\" \"excellent,\" and \"looked like a grown-up.\"\n\nDespite the praise for Pence's performance, the mainstream media's post-debate coverage was expected to focus on Kaine's allegations against Pence and his running mate Donald Trump. CNN's Jake Tapper, for instance, suggested that the night went to Pence but questioned whether the week would belong to Kaine.\n\nThe debate's moderation sparked a wave of criticism on social media, with many conservatives accusing Quijano of bias. The debate's interruptions and the moderator's questions were also a topic of discussion, with some commentators pointing out that Quijano's questions to Kaine were more conversational and less confrontational than those posed to Pence.\n\nThe third and final debate between the two vice presidential candidates will take place on October 9, with CNN's Anderson Cooper joining Quijano as a moderator. With Cooper's known liberal leanings, some conservatives are already expressing concerns about the moderation of the final debate.",
    " Title: Minimum Wage Increase: A Contentious yet Persistent Policy Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe debate over increasing the minimum wage has long been a contentious issue in American politics, with both sides presenting compelling arguments for and against the policy. The latest development in this ongoing debate comes from a report released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on Wednesday, which projects that a phased-in $10.10 minimum wage, as proposed by President Obama, could result in a modest but real disemployment effect.\n\nAccording to the CBO, a $10.10 minimum wage could reduce employment by as many as 1 million jobs by the end of 2016, with the best estimate being a loss of 500,000 jobs relative to what would happen without any increase at all. This finding has been met with enthusiasm by conservatives, who have long opposed minimum wage increases and are now using the report to bolster their argument that a $10.10 minimum wage is a job killer.\n\nHowever, supporters of the minimum wage increase argue that the policy has significant benefits that outweigh the potential job losses. The CBO also found that a $10.10 minimum wage would lift about 900,000 people out of poverty and increase wages for nearly 16.5 million people. This means that for every job potentially lost, nearly 33 people would see a wage increase.\n\nFurthermore, a higher minimum wage could help mitigate some of the consequences of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that conservatives have been critical of. People who earn higher wages are less likely to quit their jobs, and when wages increase, they slide up the ACA's means-tested benefit scale. This could result in a reduction in the number of uninsured individuals, particularly in states that have refused to expand Medicaid or have not implemented the ACA effectively.\n\nIt is important to note that both sides acknowledge that it is possible to increase the minimum wage beyond the point at which the costs outstrip the benefits. However, the CBO's report suggests that $10.10 is not that point.\n\nThe debate over the minimum wage is a complex one, with both sides presenting valid arguments. The CBO's report provides valuable insight into the potential effects of a $10.10 minimum wage, but it does not necessarily determine the policy's overall merit. Ultimately, the decision will be made by lawmakers, who will need to weigh the potential job losses against the benefits of lifting millions of people out of poverty and increasing wages for millions more.",
    " Title: Obama's State of the Union Address: Emphasis on Education, Diplomacy, and Cybersecurity\n\nIn his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama proposed a series of initiatives aimed at education, diplomacy, and cybersecurity. The proposals, which would cost approximately $60 billion over a decade, include a community college initiative, new tax credits for the middle class, and an expansion of existing tax breaks for higher education.\n\nThe community college initiative, a key part of the president's plan, aims to make community college free for many students. The proposals also include a new $500 tax credit for families with two working spouses, a subsidy of up to $2,500 annually to pay for college, and the tripling, up to $3,000, of an existing tax break to pay for college.\n\nPresident Obama emphasized the importance of treating child care as a national economic priority, stating, \"It\u2019s time we stop treating child care as a side issue, or as a women\u2019s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.\"\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, the president argued for a more diplomatic approach towards Cuba, stating that the current strategy of isolation has been ineffective. He also expressed his opposition to new sanctions against Iran, preferring to engage in diplomatic talks to prevent Iran's development of a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe president also addressed the issue of cybersecurity, calling for legislation to bolster protections against cyberattacks. He cited several high-profile cyberattacks, including one against Sony Pictures, as reasons for the need for stronger protections. \"No foreign nation, no hacker should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids,\" Obama said.\n\nOverall, the president's State of the Union address focused on a combination of military power, strong diplomacy, coalition building, and the importance of leveraging technology for the benefit of all.",
    " Title: U.S. Reaffirms Justification for Syria Strikes, Calls for Global Action and Accountability\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a strong statement at the United Nations on Friday, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley reiterated the Trump administration's stance on the U.S.'s missile strikes on a Syrian airbase earlier this week, following a chemical weapons attack that resulted in the deaths of numerous civilians, including children.\n\nHaley emphasized the U.S.'s readiness to take further action, but expressed hope that it would not be necessary. She echoed President Trump's call for all civilized nations to unite in ending the atrocities in Syria and to advocate for a political solution.\n\nHaley also pointed the finger at Syria's president, Bashar Assad, as well as his allies, Iran and Russia, for the use of chemical weapons in the war-torn country. She suggested that Russia, entrusted with ensuring the removal of such weapons from Syria, may be either knowingly allowing the weapons to remain, being incompetent in their efforts, or being deceived by the Assad regime, which allegedly claims to have no chemical weapons.\n\nRussia, in response, has denounced the U.S. missile strikes and has vowed to strengthen Syria's anti-aircraft defenses.\n\nHaley reminded the U.N. Security Council of her earlier warning this week about the possibility of a unilateral U.S. strike against Syria, stating that when the international community fails to act collectively, individual states may be compelled to take independent action. She underscored that the indiscriminate use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians is a situation that warrants such action.",
    " Title: Traditional Conservative Newspaper Endorsements of Clinton Spark Backlash, Risking Subscriptions and Facing Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, traditionally conservative newspaper editorial boards across the United States have endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, sparking backlash and losing subscribers. The Cincinnati Enquirer, which hadn't endorsed a Democrat in nearly a century, and The Arizona Republic, which had only backed Republican presidential candidates in its 126-year history, have faced criticism and even death threats following their endorsements.\n\nThe Arizona Republic, in a scathing editorial this week, portrayed Donald Trump as unqualified and not a true conservative. The Enquirer, which made the decision to endorse Clinton last week, has received over a hundred angry letters and subscription cancellations, according to Peter Bhatia, the Enquirer's editor.\n\nThe backlash, presumably from ardent Trump supporters, is not surprising, analysts say. Trump has made anti-media sentiment a central theme of his campaign, and the billionaire businessman is likely to dismiss Clinton endorsements as evidence of the establishment's opposition to him.\n\nThe Enquirer was aware that its Clinton endorsement could backfire, strengthening Trump's support. \"I've certainly thought about that,\" said Bhatia. \"But at the end of the day, we felt we had an obligation to our community to make a statement about the presidential race.\"\n\nAt least a dozen major American newspapers have endorsed Clinton, but none has backed Trump. Libertarian Gary Johnson has secured at least four major endorsements, including those of the Richmond Times-Dispatch and the New Hampshire Union Leader.\n\nIn addition to The Arizona Republic and the Cincinnati Enquirer, the Dallas Morning News and USA Today have also broken decades of precedent in their presidential endorsement decisions. USA Today, which had never endorsed any presidential candidate, still technically didn't in Thursday's editorial, calling Trump \"unfit for the presidency.\" The Morning News, which hasn't endorsed a Democrat since World War II, was more explicit, urging readers to back Clinton.\n\nSince the Sept. 7 editorial, the paper has reported a drop in subscriptions. In Arizona, Republic editors have lost subscribers and received at least one death threat, though this hasn't caused them to reconsider their decision. \"We know we're doing the right thing,\" said Phil Boas, director of the paper's editorial page.\n\nWhile endorsements may have an impact on newspaper subscriptions, there are questions about how much they affect the presidential race itself. Analysts suggest that endorsements may influence voters considering third-party options, encouraging them to vote for a candidate with a chance of winning rather than casting a protest vote.",
    " Title: Democrats Push for Gun Purchases Ban by Terror Suspects, Face Opposition from Republicans and NRA\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to capitalize on the prevailing public concerns about security, Congressional Democrats are attempting to garner support for a proposal that would bar gun purchases by terror suspects. This move comes in the wake of the Republican's House victory, which was largely driven by the same security anxieties.\n\nThe initiative, spearheaded by Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., aims to prevent federally licensed gun dealers from selling firearms to individuals on a list of known and suspected terrorists. The list would be compiled by the attorney general, likely drawing from existing government databases.\n\nCurrently, gun dealers are prohibited from selling to 10 categories of people, including convicted criminals or those with severe mental illness. However, individuals on the government's terror watch lists, including those barred from air travel, are not automatically disqualified from buying weapons from gun dealers.\n\nThe bill, if passed, would require the FBI to be notified when a background check for the purchase of firearms or explosives generates a match with the watch list, and agents would often use this information to intensify surveillance on suspects. People can attempt to remove their names from terror lists or file lawsuits challenging their inclusion. The lists are predominantly composed of foreigners.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2014, individuals on one terror watch list underwent background checks to buy guns 2,233 times and were allowed to make the purchase 91 percent of the time, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office.\n\nNational Rifle Association (NRA) spokeswoman Jennifer Baker has criticized the move, citing instances of innocent people being mistakenly added to terror lists and accusing Democrats of exploiting the Paris terrorist attacks to push their gun-control agenda.\n\nSenator Feinstein's measure mirrors legislation proposed by the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., over the last decade. None of these measures have ever received a vote.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Feinstein in February, but the recent mass killings in Paris have reinvigorated the debate on terrorism and public safety as top-tier political issues. Last week, Republicans capitalized on voter's security concerns and passed legislation in the House preventing Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the U.S. until the administration tightens restrictions on their entry.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have not yet publicly stated their stance on Feinstein's bill. Opposition from Republicans and some Democrats to curbing firearms is deep, and such legislation would require support from 60 of the 100 senators, a hurdle that Democrats have not been able to overcome, even when they had a Senate majority in the aftermath of the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, massacre.\n\nIn addition to Feinstein's bill, Democrats may also pursue a measure by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., that would bar gun sales to foreigners in the U.S. from the 38 countries from which visitors need not have visas.",
    " Title: Sen. McCain Accuses Media of Cover-up in Benghazi Investigation, Challenges David Gregory on Four Americans' Deaths\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) accused the media of downplaying the ongoing investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack and questioned the sincerity of the media's concern for the four Americans who lost their lives during the incident.\n\nDuring the interview with David Gregory, McCain expressed his belief that there are still unanswered questions regarding the attack and suggested a cover-up of the information concerning the deaths of the four brave Americans. When Gregory asked for clarification on the nature of the cover-up, McCain responded by stating that the information regarding the Benghazi attack has not been forthcoming.\n\nThe interview took a dramatic turn when McCain questioned Gregory's empathy towards the four Americans who died, asking whether he cared that they had died. Gregory responded by asking what McCain meant by a cover-up, to which McCain replied that the cover-up was of the information concerning the deaths of the four Americans.\n\nMcCain then provided a list of questions that have not been answered, including what the president did and who he spoke to on the night of the attack, why those who were evacuated from the consulate the next day were not interviewed, and why the president continued to claim for two weeks that he did not know whether it was a terrorist attack or not.\n\nMcCain concluded by stating that the answers to these questions are necessary to reach conclusions and that the lack of answers is a fact. The interview ended with McCain's statement, \"But hey, what difference at this point does it make, right?\"\n\nThe interview has sparked debate and discussion among political pundits and the public, with some agreeing with McCain's assessment and others criticizing his approach and tone. The investigation into the Benghazi attack remains ongoing.",
    " Title: James Comey's Book Stirs Controversy as Key Witness in Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In the aftermath of his dismissal by President Donald Trump last year, former FBI Director James Comey has emerged as a crucial witness for Special Counsel Robert Mueller in the ongoing investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 election. Comey's written accounts of his interactions with Trump, including the president's requests for loyalty and for the FBI to drop its investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, form the core of Mueller's inquiry into potential obstruction of justice.\n\nHowever, the release of Comey's book, \"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\" has sparked a new crisis for the White House and raised questions about Comey's credibility as a key witness. The book, in which Comey compares Trump to the Mafia bosses he once prosecuted, has been met with criticism from the Republican National Committee, which launched an offensive against the book, challenging Comey's credibility.\n\nThe Republican National Committee's website features a section titled \"Lyin' Comey,\" which includes critical tweets from Trump and comments from lawmakers questioning Comey's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State. Former FBI Assistant Director Ron Hosko suggested that the book may open the door to criticism that Comey wrote the dramatic account merely to enrich himself.\n\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588, Comey characterized the book project as \"an obligation to try to drive a healthy conversation\" about leadership and ethics. He explained that the loss of a young son to a preventable infection inspired him to offer a vision of ethical leadership to people, especially young people.\n\nComey defended the timing of the book's publication amid the Russia inquiry and before the release of a Justice Department inspector general's examination into the FBI's handling of the Clinton email investigation, which Comey oversaw. He told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he did not consult Mueller about the timing of the book's publication.\n\nIn the book, Comey wrote, \"It is wrong to stand idly by, or worse, to stay silent when you know better, while a president brazenly seeks to undermine public confidence in law enforcement institutions that were established to keep our leaders in check.\"\n\nPatrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor, suggested that there is less risk in limiting a witness's public statement about an ongoing case, but Comey's story has been the subject of a full, public Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. Cotter stated, \"Unless there are glaring inconsistencies in his testimony and what he told the special counsel and in his book, I don't see a problem. It appears to me that what I know about the book is that he is sharing his inner monologue about his interactions with the president that he already has testified about. He's not changing the facts.\"\n\nCotter added that any argument related to a financial incentive could fall flat. \"As far as I know, everybody does what they do for money. I thought the Republicans were in favor of capitalism,\" Cotter said. \"In a perfect world, you would put witnesses in a cryogenic chamber and only let them out when it's time to testify. That's not the world we live in.\"",
    " Title: Gina Haspel Confirmed as First Female Director of CIA, Despite Controversy Over Past Role in Interrogation Program\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Gina Haspel, a veteran intelligence officer with a 33-year career at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), has been confirmed as the first female director of the agency following a close Senate vote that saw six Democrats join Republicans. The 54-45 vote was the closest for a CIA nominee in the nearly seven decades that a Senate nod has been required.\n\nHaspel, 61, is a native of Kentucky but grew up around the world as the daughter of an Air Force serviceman. She has worked in Africa, Europe, and classified locations globally and was tapped as deputy director of the CIA last year. Haspel worked under former CIA director Mike Pompeo until President Donald Trump moved him to secretary of state.\n\nHaspel's confirmation was backed by many in the CIA rank-and-file and was robustly supported by senior intelligence officials, including six former CIA directors and three former national intelligence directors. National Intelligence Director Dan Coats said Haspel has integrity and both frontline and executive intelligence expertise.\n\nHowever, Haspel's opponents argued that it was not right to promote someone who supervised a covert detention site in Thailand where terror suspects were waterboarded, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning. They said the U.S. needed to slam closed what was one of the CIA's darkest chapters that tainted America's image with allies abroad.\n\nSeveral senators said Haspel was not forthcoming in answering questions about her role in the torture program or the CIA's decision to destroy video-taped evidence of the sessions. They also had questions about her rejection of the now-banned techniques.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a floor speech that Haspel \"offered up almost the classic Washington non-apology.\" He asked how the Senate could take seriously Haspel's \"conversion on torture?\"\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the world was watching the confirmation vote, which he called a \"referendum on torture.\" He said the so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" the CIA used at black sites, including slamming detainees against walls and confining them in coffin-shaped boxes, amounted to \"government-sanctioned torture.\"\n\nHaspel has vowed never to restart such a program and says her \"strong moral compass\" would prevent her from carrying out any presidential order she found objectionable. That was enough to coax some senators into the \"yes\" column. However, Leahy said he still questioned her judgment and lamented that she has never publicly condemned torture as \"immoral.\"\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said the nomination was not just about Haspel, but the U.S. grappling with its past mistakes.\n\n\"The bottom line is this: No one has ever been held accountable for the torture program and I do not believe those who were intimately involved in it deserve to lead the agency,\" Feinstein said before casting her vote against Haspel.\n\nSince Trump nominated Haspel, her confirmation has been clouded by debate over the CIA's former interrogation program. A protester in the Senate visitor gallery briefly disrupted speeches ahead of the vote with shouts against the CIA.\n\nThree Republicans opposed her: Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is battling cancer and did not vote; Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky; and Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona. Six Democrats, however, were heartened by her pledge to never restart harsh interrogation programs, even if Trump requested. They said they voted for Haspel because they thought her experience was essential in confronting today's threats from U.S. adversaries like Russia, North Korea, China, and Iran.\n\nAmong Democrats supporting Haspel were several up for re-election this fall in states where Trump is popular, including Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Sen. Bill Nelson in Florida. Also voting yes were Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking member of the intelligence committee.\n\n\"This has not been an easy decision,\" Warner said, adding that he'd met and talked with Haspel many times in the past several weeks. He said he's convinced that Haspel could and would stand up to Trump, who has voiced support for waterboarding and has said \"torture works.\"\n\nAfter the vote, human rights groups quickly issued statements denouncing the confirmation and the now-defunct program.\n\n\"The Senate has now rewarded that atrocious conduct by promoting someone that reportedly administered it to lead one of the government's most powerful agencies,\" said Daphne Eviatar at Amnesty International USA.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Creation Falls Short in May, Significantly Impacting June Fed Rate Hike Prospects\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK -- The U.S. job market took a significant hit in May, with the creation of only 38,000 jobs, far below the expected 160,000 new positions. This marked the worst month for job creation since September 2010.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, led by Chairwoman Janet Yellen, had been signaling a potential interest rate hike in the coming months, with June as a possible candidate. However, the disappointing jobs report has led to a reevaluation of these plans.\n\nSteven Ricchiuto, chief economist at MSUSA, described the jobs report as \"horrible.\" Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at EverBank, called it \"very weak.\" Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, referred to the jobs number as a \"bombshell.\"\n\nThe weak job creation in May has led to a near-zero chance of a Fed rate hike at the June meeting, which concludes on June 15. \"This is the weakest number of workers added in almost six years,\" Gaffney said via email.\n\nBefore the jobs report was released, the odds of a June hike stood at 19%. After the data, these odds plummeted to about 4%, according to CME Group's futures markets.\n\nWhile the chances of a July hike have also decreased, from close to 60% to 34%, professional investors are not yet ruling out a hike in July. The market reaction was swift, with stocks dipping, bond yields falling, and the U.S. dollar weakening as the Fed's rate-hike timetable gets pushed back.\n\nThe unemployment rate did decrease to 4.7%, but this was primarily due to \"another big drop in the labor force,\" according to Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. Yellen is scheduled to speak on Monday, and Wall Street will be closely listening for insights into the Fed's thinking.\n\n\"Yellen should provide more insight on the Fed's thinking Monday,\" Ashworth said via email.",
    " Title: Facebook's Removal of Pages Sparks Controversy, Raises Concerns Over Foreign Meddling in U.S. Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and raised concerns, Facebook has removed 32 pages from its platform, citing \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" that may be linked to Russia. Among the pages taken down was an event page for a counter-protest to a white nationalist march in Washington D.C., organized by Black Lives Matter DC.\n\nThe counter-protest event, titled \"No Unite the Right 2 - DC,\" was being organized before the first page was set up. However, the removal of the page has caused organizers to fear a potential backlash, with organizer April Goggans stating, \"Our participation may take a hit because people are trying to find out what's legit and what's not. We've had to prove we exist.\"\n\nFacebook's statement suggests that administrators of a page called \"Resisters\" were connected with those from other legitimate pages, who helped drum up support for the protest. However, Andrew Batcher, an organizer for the Shut It Down DC coalition, stated that the event page created by \"Resisters\" was taken over and controlled by \"a lot of real people doing real work.\" Batcher also noted that he has not seen any evidence that any administrator for the \"Resisters\" page was a \"bad actor.\"\n\nWhile Facebook did not directly link the 32 pages in question to Russia, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have done so. A spokesman for Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley stated that Facebook had informed his office \"that a limited group of Russian actors has attempted to spread disinformation using its platform, and that the affected groups are affiliated with the political left.\"\n\nThe issue highlights a broader difficulty social media sites now face in identifying Russian actors. While the intelligence community has concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 election through online activities, Russia's meddling has not been limited to pro-Trump activities, especially this election cycle.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Facebook also detected coordinated activity around the #AbolishICE campaign, a left-wing movement advocating for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The issue underscores a potential threat to the integrity of political discourse on social media platforms, with both sides of the political aisle potentially being influenced by foreign actors.\n\nThe controversy comes as the Trump administration continues to grapple with allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. In February, President Trump approvingly retweeted a statement by Facebook's Vice President of Ads, Rob Goldman, who had written that the majority of Russian spending on ads occurred after the 2016 election, and that swaying the election was not the main goal of those ads. However, Goldman later clarified that \"the Russian campaign was certainly in favor of Trump.\"\n\nThe New York Times also reported that Russia used Facebook groups for a wide range of causes, including groups such as United Muslims of America, Blacktivist, and Secured Borders. The use of such groups raises concerns about the potential for foreign actors to manipulate public opinion and sow discord in the United States.\n\nWith the president still playing clean-up after appearing to initially accept Vladimir Putin's denial of election meddling during their summit last month, the administration is making clear they accept the prior U.S. intelligence findings and take the threat seriously. At a White House press briefing last Thursday, officials warned that a disinformation campaign from Moscow is ongoing. The administration's stance underscores the need for social media platforms to be vigilant in identifying and combating foreign meddling in U.S. politics.",
    " Title: Republican Representative Cole Advocates for Bipartisan Approach to Tax Rates, Urges Early Agreement on Bush Tax Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a private meeting on Tuesday, Republican Representative \u2588\u2588\u2588 called on his colleagues to vote to extend the Bush tax rates for all but the highest earners before the end of the year, suggesting a bipartisan approach to avoid the fiscal cliff.\n\nCole, a Republican from Oklahoma, told POLITICO in an interview that he believes such a vote would not violate the anti-tax pledge by Grover Norquist and that he is not alone in his stance within Republican circles. During a meeting of the House GOP whip team earlier in the day, he argued that Republicans would strengthen their position by joining hands with President Barack Obama to give most taxpayers a \"early Christmas present\" by ensuring their taxes don't increase on January 1.\n\nCole's position is notable given his reputation as a staunch Republican and adherent to party orthodoxy. He has served as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee and held other official posts within the party. Cole's proposal might also provide cover for other Republicans looking to make an agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff.\n\n\"I think we ought to take the 98 percent deal right now,\" Cole said, referring to freezing income tax rates for all but the top 2 percent of earners. \"It doesn't mean I agree with raising the top 2. I don't.\"\n\nInstead, Cole suggested that Republicans should fight the president over tax rates for the top earners after everyone else is taken care of. This approach, he said, would remove the president's argument that Republicans are holding up tax cuts for all but the top earners.\n\n\"Some people think that's our leverage in the debate. It's the Democrats' leverage in the debate,\" Cole said.\n\nCole indicated that he is likely to support his leadership when a package is put on the floor, but he also noted that there are other lawmakers in his camp, as well as others who have been willing to listen. He was adamant that his approach would not violate the Norquist pledge, which binds signatories not to join any effort to raise income tax rates. Rather than raising taxes, he said, Republicans would be voting to lower them for most people and do nothing\u2014which would result in an increase\u2014for the rest.\n\n\"I don't see that as a violation of my pledge,\" he said.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Conservative Majority Leans on Textualism in Key Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Supreme Court's conservative justices have been controlling most of the closely divided cases this term by adhering to the words written by Congress, as they meticulously define terms such as \"for,\" \"shall,\" \"any,\" and \"other,\" among others. This approach, known as textualism, has resulted in a series of 5-4 decisions written by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito.\n\nThe justices have settled challenges involving the rights of workers, immigrants, prisoners, and patent owners by interpreting the statutes under review literally. This has led to a series of decisions that rely on \"textualism\" \u2013 letting the statutes speak for themselves.\n\nPaul Clement, former U.S. solicitor general who has argued more than 90 cases at the Supreme Court, notes that this is a shift in the terms of the debate. \"You don't want to walk into the court without a textualist argument,\" Clement says.\n\nJustice Gorsuch, the newest justice now entering his second year on the court, had promised during his Senate confirmation in 2017 to \"try to understand what the words on the page mean, not import words that come from us.\"\n\nLast week, Gorsuch refused to read into the National Labor Relations Act any rules for handling legal disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act. Gorsuch's opinion for the court held that employers can insist that workers settle labor disputes individually through arbitration.\n\nIn another 5-4 decision written by Gorsuch last month, the court said an administrative board created to review patents can not pick and choose which parts of a patent to review.\n\nIn February, Gorsuch's 5-4 opinion for the court held that under federal law, prisoners who win civil rights suits must pay up to 25% of their award \"to satisfy\" attorneys' fees. Lower court judges can not limit a prisoner's contribution, the court said.\n\nIn dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the law lets judges limit the amount prisoners must pay. The phrase \"to satisfy\" does not necessarily mean in full, she said, citing other contexts ranging from credit card payments to college course credits.\n\nSupreme Court experts say Gorsuch's addition has merely returned the court to Scalia's brand of textualism. \"The court is no more textualist than it was when Scalia was on the court,\" says Irving Gornstein, executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University Law Center. \"The only thing that has changed is that one textualist has been replaced by another.\"\n\nHowever, Jeffrey Fisher, co-director of the Stanford Law School Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, says Gorsuch \"seems to be trying to put some fresh wind in the sails of textualism. And it seems he\u2019s having some success.\"\n\nJustices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas also stuck to the letter of the law in recent 5-4 rulings. Alito ruled that illegal immigrants can be detained indefinitely while their cases are reviewed, rather than given intermittent bail hearings.\n\nIn a second case involving workers' rights, Thomas's 5-4 ruling found that service advisers at car dealerships can be excluded from the Fair Labor Standards Act's wage and hour protections because their duties are akin to salesmen and partsmen, who are specifically excluded.\n\nElizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, says conservatives often accuse liberals of reading into statutes what they want them to say. The court's conservatives, she says, also are guilty of that.\n\n\"There\u2019s going to be a battle about what is actual textualism,\" Wydra says. \"And the liberals aren\u2019t giving up that fight.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Signs Executive Order to Address Social Media Regulation and Liability Protections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and debate, President Donald Trump has announced his intention to sign an executive order on Thursday, aiming to regulate social media and technology companies. The decision follows a fact-check by Twitter on one of the president's tweets regarding mail-in voting.\n\nThe order is based on section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a provision that aims to protect free speech by shielding providers from liability for the content they host. The section states, \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"\n\nThe president's executive order seeks to add regulations to section 230, aiming to limit the liability protections for companies that editorialize or censor content or speech. The president also plans to instruct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to act as a check on reported political bias.\n\nPresident Trump's tweet about mail-in voting was fact-checked by Twitter, while the president has noted that the platform has left propaganda from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unchecked until recently.\n\nThe White House tweeted, \"Today, I am signing an executive order to protect and uphold the free speech and rights of the American people.\" Bloomberg QuickTake reported that Trump described social media companies as currently receiving \"an unprecedented liability shield.\"\n\nThe executive order is expected to face legal challenges in court regarding its constitutionality. The president has partnered with Attorney General Bill Barr in this effort. AG Barr contends that the new order does not repeal section 230, but rather an accountability measure to ensure that the law is interpreted correctly.\n\nSection 230 has been a subject of criticism from both Republicans and Democrats, who argue that the law allows social media companies to avoid the responsibility to ensure truth is present online. The executive order is expected to be a significant development in the ongoing debate about the role and responsibility of social media companies in the digital age.",
    " Title: Immigration Overhaul: A Long and Contentious Road Ahead Amidst Cautious Optimism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate over an immigration law overhaul remains a complex and challenging issue, with bipartisan supporters expressing cautious optimism but facing significant hurdles in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. In June, a comprehensive immigration bill, which included a 13-year path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country and stricter border security measures, passed the Senate with bipartisan support. However, this legislation has largely stalled in the House, where Speaker John Boehner has rejected negotiations with the Senate over its comprehensive bill.\n\nSenator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a key negotiator of the Senate bill, acknowledged the challenging road ahead, stating, \"This is obviously a long, hard road, but I think since August, the number on the other side vehemently opposed has stayed the same, the number who think it should go forward has grown, and numbers in the wide middle are less opposed than they used to be. But that doesn't guarantee an outcome one way or another.\"\n\nRepublican Party leaders, backed by business groups, have emphasized the necessity of an overhaul to repair their political position with Latino and other immigrant voters. Former Chief of Staff to Speaker Boehner, Barry Jackson, is now consulting for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which supports an overhaul that expands high-technology visas and guest worker programs.\n\nDespite the importance of the issue, immigration is less of a concern during midterm elections, when immigrants are less likely to vote, and House members in safe districts are somewhat insulated from the influence of more moderate swing voters. The biggest threats to Republicans often come from primary challenges from more conservative candidates who argue that changing the immigration status of undocumented immigrants amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers.\n\nRepresentative John Carter, Republican of Texas and one of the Gang of Eight House members who attempted to forge a bipartisan overhaul, told Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call that an election year is not the time to press forward. \"Immigration is a very, very contentious issue,\" he said. The future of the immigration overhaul remains uncertain, with both supporters and opponents maintaining their positions, and the political landscape potentially influencing the outcome.",

The president's winter recess, filled with golf, fine dining, snorkeling, and a private zoo visit, has been akin to a dream getaway for many.\n\nDespite the idyllic setting, the president's aides confirm that he remains diligent, receiving daily presidential briefings, including the \"threat matrix\" from intelligence agencies, and engaging in conference calls about global hotspots. The president also signed a few bills, participated in discussions about contentious legislation, and received updates on terrorist attacks in Russia.\n\nThe Obamas' luxurious living in a $3,500-per-day beach house in Kailua, Oahu, is being paid for privately, although taxpayers cover the cost of the first family's travel on Air Force One. The rental home costs $56,000, while the flights on Air Force One, which cost over $180,000 per hour, amount to a couple of million dollars.\n\nThe vacation has been an expensive affair for taxpayers, with hundreds of federal workers joining in, including White House staffers and the Secret Service security detail. According to watchdog.org, the government rented at least seven homes in the area, costing taxpayers over $183,750, with the overall cost estimated to reach $4 million.\n\nIn comparison to the 2012 vacation, which cost taxpayers at least $7.2 million due to a \"fiscal cliff\" negotiation, this year's Hawaiian vacation has been more tranquil. The president has engaged in various activities, such as golf, gym workouts, family hikes, beach trips, and snorkeling. The Obamas also had the Honolulu Zoo all to themselves for a visit on Thursday.\n\nThe first couple has met with U.S. troops once but have not attended church services, even for Christmas. Reporters and photographers, who have spent tens of thousands of dollars to cover the president's vacation, have been kept at a distance, but were allowed to observe the president during his New Year's Eve shopping center outing and his golf outing with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key.\n\nAs President Obama returns to Washington next week, he will once again face the challenges of his office, with the decisions likely to get tougher. The president, who is known for his wit, quipped during a golf outing, \"I guess I should have chipped it, after all.\"",

Braces for Second Unite the Right Rally as Businesses Prepare to Refuse Service to Participants\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the second Unite the Right rally approaches in Washington D.C., white supremacists and white nationalists may face challenges in finding transportation and dining options due to the stance taken by various businesses and ride-sharing services. The rally, scheduled for Sunday, coincides with the one-year anniversary of the violent white supremacist events in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nIn Charlottesville, police have taken precautions, blocking off streets and mobilizing hundreds of officers downtown. A group of Antifa protestors marched through the city Saturday afternoon, carrying a flag that read \"Antifascist action.\"\n\nIn preparation for the rally near the White House, Uber and Lyft have informed drivers that they have the right to refuse service to passengers who harass or threaten them. The Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington has also sent out a toolkit to inform restaurateurs of their legal rights to refuse service to white nationalists and other political fringe groups.\n\nAirbnb has previously threatened to ban users who participate in the rally. In a statement shared with Fox News, the company confirmed that it would take appropriate action against users who behave in a manner that is antithetical to the Airbnb Community Commitment, which may include removal from the platform.\n\nRally organizer, Jason Kessler, has obtained a permit for Lafayette Park across from the White House, expecting 400 supporters to attend. The first \"Unite The Right\" rally in Charlottesville on Aug. 12, 2017, resulted in violent clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters, with one person being killed when a white supremacist drove into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nSeveral restaurant owners in Washington D.C. have stated that they are prepared to refuse service to those participating in the rally or to close their establishments altogether. Dan Simons, owner of Founding Farmers, told The Washingtonian, \"Our mentality is we\u2019re going to protect each other. This is our city. Our house. Our people.\"\n\nEllen Kassoff Gray, owner of Equinox restaurant near the White House, also expressed her intention to refuse service to those who espouse hate. \"I\u2019ll proudly stay open and serve those who are respectful and kind. But being a Jewish restaurant owner and having a pro-Nazi group come to town, would I refuse service? Yes, I would,\" she told The Washingtonian.\n\nAs for the Proud Boys, verified accounts belonging to the group and its founder, Gavin McInnes, were suspended by Twitter for violating the platform's policy against \"violent extremist groups,\" according to The Guardian.

The move comes amid the ongoing controversy surrounding national anthem protests.\n\nThe White House event will feature the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus, with the National Anthem and other patriotic music set to be played at 3 P.M. Trump announced the event on Twitter, stating, \"We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M. The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!\"\n\nThe White House's decision to disinvite the entire team marks the end of speculation over whether the Eagles would visit the White House in some capacity. The team reportedly wanted to send a small group of players. Trump's decision to rescind the invitation followed his tweet late Monday, stating, \"The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!\"\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney responded to Trump's move, stating, \"Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our president is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend.\"\n\nLast month, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the league would fine teams and league personnel who do not \"stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem.\" Goodell said the league unanimously agreed to the vote, though San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York abstained. The new overhaul does allow players to remain in the locker room for the anthem.\n\nTrump's Eagles decision and his Tuesday tweet reflect ongoing tension between his White House and players protesting police violence by sitting out the national anthem. The President also used his Twitter account Tuesday to note past events the White House has held with other championship teams. Trump tweeted, \"We have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others.

Speaker of the House, John Boehner (R-Ohio), announced the impending legal action on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nThe decision to sue comes after the House approved two resolutions last Thursday, which found Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to provide further documents to congressional investigators. The criminal contempt resolution opens the possibility for the House to call on the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to bring the case before a grand jury. However, Deputy Attorney General James Cole informed Boehner in a letter on Friday that the agency would not prosecute, stating that Holder's failure to release the documents does not constitute a crime.\n\nThe civil contempt resolution, on the other hand, grants the House the ability to ask a court to compel the Justice Department to hand over the documents. President Obama has already asserted executive privilege over the documents in question.\n\nThe investigation into the Fast and Furious operation, led by GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has been ongoing for 16 months. The non-defunct Operation Fast and Furious was run out of an Arizona field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which is under the Justice Department.\n\nThe operation involved putting roughly 2,000 assault guns into the hands of arms dealers, then allowing the guns to cross the U.S.-Mexico border with the expectation they would resurface at crime scenes and lead agents to organizers of Mexican drug cartels. Two of the weapons were found at the site of the 2010 shooting death of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Jack Lew stated on \"Fox News Sunday\" that the Justice Department's decision not to prosecute Holder was based on a Reagan administration memo and that the House's continued efforts are \"political\" and a \"fishing expedition.\"",
    " Title: James Clapper Criticizes President Trump's Openness to Foreign Opposition Research, Cites Double Standard in Dossier Case\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of George Stephanopoulos' exclusive interview with President Donald Trump, former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, appeared on Anderson Cooper 360 to discuss the president's comments regarding his willingness to listen to foreign opposition research. During the interview, Clapper and Cooper focused on Trump's statement about considering information provided by a foreign country, particularly a foreign adversary, disregarding the potential for disinformation.\n\n\"It's certainly interesting. I've run out of adjectives to describe my reaction to this. Incredible, amazing, stunning, and disturbing that the president would advocate for this use of accepting information provided by a foreign country, notably a foreign adversary, while completely overlooking the fact that this could, will be, probably would be, disinformation,\" Clapper told Cooper. \"In other words, completely phony. And to endorse that, and in doing so endorse, undercut the FBI, and its director, it's just incredible. I can't get over the duplicity of it.\"\n\nClapper's comments come as a response to Trump's statement that he would be open to receiving opposition research from foreign entities. Clapper argued that this stance could potentially undermine the FBI and its director, especially considering the potential for disinformation.\n\nHowever, Clapper also pointed out a perceived double standard in the handling of opposition research. \"Wait a second. We have a double standard here. It's okay for the FBI to run with the Steele dossier, despite it being compiled by a former British spy, someone who could arguably be a 'foreign influencer,' but it's not okay for a campaign to even think about hearing out the information another country has?\" Clapper asked.\n\nClapper argued that the criticism of the infamous dossier, compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, is due to the FBI's acceptance of the document as fact. \"Here's all this criticism about the infamous dossier, and you can't use it because it's not valid. You can't accept it. That's, and in this case, okay. And we're looking in the future here. We're not talking about the past,\" Clapper added.\n\nClapper also addressed the issue of political motivations in the handling of the dossier. \"The problem conservatives have with the dossier is that the FBI didn't vet what was in the dossier. They accepted it as fact. Opposition research is the norm. It happens in every campaign during every election. Did Hillary Clinton have a right to do oppo research on Trump? Absolutely. The government, however, has an obligation to independently verify what was in the document, especially when we're talking about obtaining FISA warrants based on said information,\" Clapper stated.\n\nClapper also criticized the media for not independently verifying the information in the dossier, stating that they accepted it as fact because it was damning evidence against Trump. \"Don't be fooled. There were political motives in not vetting Steele's information,\" Clapper said.\n\nAccording to Cooper, this is Trump's \"clarion call\" for information from foreign countries, particularly Russia, in the upcoming 2020 election. \"They're [Russia] going to repeat what they did in 2016. They're going to repeat it in 2020,\" Clapper said. \"And now, what President Trump has done, is encourage them to do so. Again, it's just, it's just stunning.\"",
    " Title: Planned Parenthood Affiliates Face Repayment of $80 Million in PPP Loans Due to Ineligibility\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, thirty-seven Planned Parenthood affiliates have been notified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) that they must return a total of $80 million in loans received from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), as they were ineligible for the coronavirus stimulus payouts. The SBA has stated that affiliates of larger organizations with more than 500 employees, such as the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PFFA), which has over 600 employees, are not eligible for PPP distributions.\n\nOne such affiliate, Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington (PPMW), will receive a letter stating that although it self-certified that it was eligible for a $1,328,000 PPP loan in accordance with the SBA\u2019s affiliation rules, it will need to return the money. This request for funds came just months after PPMW\u2019s president and CEO, Laura Meyers, promised to turn down federal funds in response to the Trump administration's ban on Planned Parenthood clinics making abortion referrals if they wanted to continue receiving federal funds.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who serves as chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, has called for an immediate investigation into the matter. Rubio stated, \"There is no ambiguity in the legislation that passed or public record around its passage that organizations such as Planned Parenthood, whose parent organization has close to half a billion dollars in assets, is not eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program.\"\n\nIn 2018-2019, Planned Parenthood reported a record-high number of abortions and government funding. At the same time, Planned Parenthood claimed that abortion constituted just a small percentage \u2013 4 percent in 2018-2019 \u2013 of its services, and that federal funds did not go directly to abortions.\n\nThe SBA warned of \"severe penalties\" for incorrect or false eligibility certifications by PPP recipients, including criminal or civil sanctions if the SBA determined borrowers made knowingly false statements. The SBA letter explained that PPFA affiliates were clearly covered by the PPP affiliate rules, as PPFA's bylaws require a certification by the PPFA board and govern each affiliate by written bylaws that conform to PPFA policies.\n\nThe largest single government loan was a $7.5 million allotment to the Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties in California. One Planned Parenthood affiliate received a loan but declined it. Canceled or returned funds can be used during future PPP rounds.\n\nRepublicans have strongly resisted reported efforts from some Democrats to push abortion-related spending amid the pandemic. In March, The Daily Caller reported House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tried to include federal funding for abortion in the coronavirus stimulus bill. Multiple senior White House officials told the outlet that speaking to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Pelosi sought a provision for up to $1 billion to \"reimburse laboratory claims.\" This might set a precedent for health-related spending without the protections of the Hyde Amendment, a compromise restricting federal funds for abortion in most cases.",
    " Title: Alabama Senate Passes Controversial Abortion Ban Bill, Sending Measure to Governor's Desk\n\nThe Alabama Senate on Tuesday evening approved a bill that imposes stringent restrictions on abortions, with the measure now heading to Governor Kay Ivey's (R) desk for potential signing into law. The legislation, which passed by a 25-6 vote, would effectively ban abortions in almost all instances, including for victims of rape and incest, and would only allow the procedure if necessary to save a mother's life.\n\nThe bill's proponents hope the legislation, along with similar restrictions in other states, will instigate a Supreme Court challenge that could potentially overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion. State Rep. Terri Collins (R), who sponsored the bill, told The Washington Post that the exceptions were intentionally left out to create a strong enough law to trigger a federal court battle.\n\nThe legislation was temporarily tabled last week due to a heated argument on the Senate floor after the exception for cases of rape and incest was removed from the bill. If signed into law, anyone performing an abortion could face 10 to 99 years in prison, but no criminal charges would be brought against a person undergoing the procedure.\n\nThe bill is the most restrictive abortion law in the country, with 16 states having passed or considering abortion bans once a fetal heartbeat is detected, about six weeks into pregnancy. Four states have approved so-called heartbeat abortion laws.\n\nThe pro-abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America swiftly condemned Tuesday's vote, expressing concern that the current Supreme Court composition puts Roe v. Wade at risk following the confirmation of President Trump's two nominees.\n\n\"Alabama just passed a law that is a total ban on abortion, criminalizing the act and punishing women and doctors,\" NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement. \"Anti-choice Republicans no longer even pretend to respect the law or the women that it protects.\"\n\nState Sen. Vivian Figures (D) told The Washington Post before the bill was considered, \"If I were them, I would be making plans to leave Alabama. Who is going to stay in a state like this?\"\n\nThe passage of the bill has sparked heated debates and concerns about the future of reproductive rights in the United States.",

The shrine, a significant religious site for all Muslims, is particularly revered by the Shiite sect and is surrounded by guards due to fears of potential destruction by Sunni extremist rebels.\n\nAccompanied by a local doctor, who requested anonymity, we navigated through the city, passing bombed-out buildings and military checkpoints. The doctor, a longtime resident and worker at a nearby hospital, expressed his concern for the shrine, citing the potential threat from Sunni extremist rebels who, he believes, do not respect religious sites and follow Wahhabi ideologies.\n\nUpon reaching the shrine, we were greeted by a series of military checkpoints and a bustling street leading to the golden-domed shrine, adorned with elaborate blue tiles. Inside, we found a courtyard filled with words echoing the support for Assad's government, marking the deaths of three men who were martyrs in the war.\n\nThe guards of the shrine include Lebanese allies of Assad, longtime veterans of the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah, and local men, such as a former sheep dealer who joined a volunteer defense force. The doctor, our guide, took us through the golden dome and into a room of brilliant light, covered with mirrored tiles. Pilgrims touched the tomb of Sayida Zeinab, and we spoke with a young mother who expressed her support for Assad's government.\n\nLeaving the shrine, we walked down the battle-scarred street behind it and arrived at a local hospital. There, we met again with the doctor who shared his thoughts on the Syrian people's sentiments towards President Assad. He stated that while a significant portion of the population either strongly supports or vehemently opposes Assad, the majority, comprising 60%, loves their country and does not want it to be destroyed.\n\nThe doctor, while not expressing undying loyalty to Assad, expressed disapproval of the rebels. He stated that he supports any revolution that aims to improve the country and establish democracy but disapproves of those that would destroy the country.

    " Title: Afghan Immigrant Ahmad Khan Rahami Arrested in Connection with New York and New Jersey Bombings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old Afghan immigrant, was apprehended on Monday following a shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey. Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen, is suspected of being involved in a series of bombings that occurred in New York City and a New Jersey shore town over the weekend.\n\nRahami, who underwent surgery for a gunshot wound to his leg, was discovered sleeping in a bar doorway and was wounded in a subsequent gun battle with police. Two officers were also injured but are not in critical condition. The arrest came hours after authorities issued a bulletin and photo of Rahami, who lived with his family in an apartment in Elizabeth, New Jersey, above a fried-chicken restaurant owned by his father.\n\nU.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, the chief federal prosecutor in New York, stated that New Jersey officials will likely bring charges against Rahami for the police officers' shooting, while federal authorities consider their own charges. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio described the incident as an \"act of terror.\"\n\nThe bombings began on Saturday night when a shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bomb exploded in New York's Chelsea section, wounding 29 people, none seriously. An unexploded pressure-cooker bomb was found blocks away. Earlier that day, a pipe bomb exploded in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity race to benefit Marines. No one was injured. On Sunday night, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an Elizabeth train station. Investigators have not publicly tied Rahami to these bombs, and they are still gathering evidence.\n\nWith Rahami's arrest, officials stated that there are no indications of more bombs or suspects to find, though they cautioned that they are still working to understand Rahami's connections. His motive remains unclear, according to New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill.\n\nWilliam Sweeney Jr., the FBI's assistant director in New York, stated that there are no indications Rahami was on law enforcement's radar at the time of the bombings. As for how investigators zeroed in on him as a suspect, three law enforcement officials said the clues included a fingerprint lifted from one of the New York sites and \"clear as day\" surveillance video from the bombing scene that helped identify Rahami. The officials spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case.\n\nFive people were pulled over on Sunday night in a vehicle associated with Rahami, but were questioned and released. At least one of Rahami's relatives was in the car, which appeared headed toward Kennedy Airport in New York after coming from New Jersey.\n\nLinden Mayor Derek Armstead stated that the break in the case came late Monday morning, when the owner of a bar reported someone asleep in his doorway. A police officer went to investigate and recognized the man as Rahami. Rahami pulled a gun and shot the officer, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, in the torso, and more officers joined in a gun battle that spilled into the street.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, a national Muslim advocacy group, welcomed Rahami's arrest. The organization and the Afghan Embassy in Washington condemned the bombings. The arrest came as President Barack Obama was in New York on a previously scheduled visit for a meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. He called on Americans to \"show the world we will never give in to fear.\"\n\nRahami lived with his family on a busy street a few miles from the Newark airport. The building that houses the family's restaurant and home was cordoned off when an Associated Press reporter visited. Rahami's father, Mohammad, and two of Rahami's brothers sued the city of Elizabeth in 2011 after it passed an ordinance requiring their restaurant, First American Fried Chicken, to close early because of complaints from neighbors that it was a late-night nuisance. The lawsuit was terminated in 2012 after Mohammad Rahami pleaded guilty to blocking police from enforcing the restrictions on the restaurant.\n\nRyan McCann, of Elizabeth, said that he often ate at the restaurant and recently began seeing the younger Rahami working there more. \"He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy, that's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home,\" McCann said.\n\nOn Sunday, a federal law enforcement official stated that the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. One of the five devices found at the Elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot tried to disarm it. No one was hurt.\n\nTwo homeless men grabbed a backpack left on a trash can near the Elizabeth train station, only to discover it contained several apparent pipe bombs. They quickly reported the find to police, said Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage. On Saturday, two men walking down a street in New York saw a suitcase on a sidewalk, opened it, discarded the pressure cooker they found inside, and walked off with the bag. Later that evening, after the blast in Chelsea, state troopers found the unexploded device.",
    " Title: \"West Virginia Governor Invites Virginia Counties to Secede Amidst Political Divide\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has been dubbed \"Vexit\" by the Richmond Times-Dispatch, West Virginia's Republican Governor Jim Justice has extended an invitation to Virginia counties discontent with their liberal state government in Richmond to secede and join West Virginia. The proposal was made at a press conference held with Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr. at a community college in Martinsburg, West Virginia on Tuesday.\n\n\"If you're not happy where you're at, come on down,\" Justice said. \"If you're not truly happy where you are, we stand with open arms to take you from Virginia or anywhere you may be. We stand strongly behind the Second Amendment, and we stand strongly for the unborn.\"\n\nThe invitation comes amidst growing discontent in Virginia, particularly among conservatives, following the Democratic takeover of the state government last fall. Since taking office this month, the new Democratic administration has moved to dismantle laws protecting gun rights and abortion restrictions, as reported by \u2588\u2588\u2588 News and The Wall Street Journal. The administration is also proposing to repeal the state's 70-year old right-to-work law, a move that would force workers to join a union, pay dues, and deny them the freedom to choose whether to be part of a union or not.\n\nThousands of gun owners concerned about their freedoms gathered for a rally on the Capitol grounds in Richmond on January 20th, lobbying against the proposed legislation. Fearing the loss of their freedoms, citizens have flooded city council meetings all over the Old Dominion, resulting in 91 of Virginia's 95 counties declaring themselves Second Amendment Sanctuaries.\n\nThe idea of Virginia counties seceding to another state is not a new one. In 1863, West Virginia became a state formed from western counties of Virginia that opposed Virginia's decision to secede from the United States. West Virginia is the only state created by seceding from a Confederate state.\n\nWhen asked for a reaction to West Virginia's proposal that Virginia counties join their state, Virginia Democrat Governor Ralph Northam's office responded, \"It sounds like it's an election year in West Virginia.\" Virginia Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw (D) described the secession proposal as \"preposterous,\" suggesting West Virginia should focus on fixing its high poverty rate.\n\nMinority leader in the House of Delegates, Todd Gilbert, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News many Virginians across the state are not happy with the Democrat agenda, but Republicans are not retreating from the political fray in Richmond. Despite this, he seemed to appreciate West Virginia's offer.\n\n\"We're nowhere near done fighting for our values here in the Commonwealth,\" Gilbert said. \"Democrats have been in power for less than two months and they're already raising taxes, working to let violent felons out of jail early, and punishing law-abiding gun owners. We think Virginians will have a significant case of buyer's remorse very soon. That being said, it's always nice to have options.\"\n\nHowever, concern by Virginia conservatives over the leftist tilt of their state government is not going away. Jerry Falwell, Jr., President of Liberty University, described the situation in Virginia as \"a tragedy in the making.\" He accused Democratic leaders in Richmond of elitism and radicalism, stripping away the God-given rights of Virginia citizens despite their due protections under the US Constitution.\n\nWhether what is now part of Virginia could become a new part of West Virginia remains uncertain. According to Fox News, lawyers consulted by Falwell suggested that, if Virginians wanted to, secession would be a difficult process. Virginia counties would need to conduct petition drives, followed by a referendum. If successful, the proposal would then go before the Virginia General Assembly. University of Virginia law professor Richard Schragger told the Times-Dispatch the move was \"certainly a long shot,\" and would require the consent of Congress and both states.\n\nFor their part, lawmakers in West Virginia have already introduced formal resolutions inviting parts of Virginia to join their state. The future of this unusual political proposal remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Seismic Activity in North Korea Determined as Natural Event, Not Nuclear Test\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing several hours of analysis, Chinese and South Korean monitors have concluded that the seismic activity in North Korea on Saturday was a natural event and not a nuclear test. The South Korean Meteorological Administration reported a magnitude 3.0 earthquake in North Hamgyeong Province, an area where North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3.\n\nThe Korea Meteorological Administration stated that the activity occurred in Kilju, a site near where the nuclear test took place. The seismic service in China also confirmed that the quake was a natural event, as reported by Xinhua, China's official news agency. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization also indicated that their initial analysis suggests the quake was unlikely to be man-made.\n\nThe seismic activity comes amidst growing tension over North Korea's nuclear and missile intentions. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to take the \"highest-level\" action in response to President Trump's threat to \"totally destroy\" North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho recently stated that Pyongyang may consider its most powerful test of a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn response to escalating tensions, China announced on Saturday that it will limit exports of petroleum products to North Korea starting in October under the terms of the latest U.N. sanctions passed in response to North Korea's sixth nuclear test. The future of the North Korea-U.S. standoff remains uncertain, with both parties maintaining firm stances on their respective positions.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Distance Themselves from Obama as Midterm Elections Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the midterm elections of 2014 approach, Senate Democrats running in competitive states are distancing themselves from President Barack Obama, who remains unpopular in many of these regions. The White House and Senate Democrats are devising a campaign strategy that aims to keep Obama's presence minimal to avoid potential complications for Democratic candidates.\n\nAccording to a report by \u2588\u2588\u2588, the White House and Senate Democrats have been in discussions with nearly every incumbent and aspiring Democratic Senate candidate across the country. However, only a handful of candidates have expressed a desire for Obama to campaign with them.\n\nAlaska Sen. Mark Begich, for instance, stated, \"I don't care to have him campaign for me. I'd rather he come up to see where his policies aren't working. He's wrong on ANWR, we've had struggles to try to get our permits done down in the southeast for our timber industry. I want to show him how important the military is in Fairbanks.\"\n\nThe president's unpopularity could potentially cost Democrats the Senate, but vulnerable incumbents need the full support of the White House to maintain their majority. The White House and party leadership are exploring ways to deploy Obama and his team in a manner that minimizes complications for Democrats in states like Colorado, Georgia, or Kentucky, where his polls are unfavorable.\n\nThe White House has committed to half a dozen Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraisers for 2014, with the first two expected in the coming weeks in New York and the Washington suburbs. Obama is also planning to attend fundraisers for the Senate Majority PAC.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, first lady Michelle Obama, and former President Bill Clinton will take the lead for Democrats, while Obama stays away. Democrats hope Hillary Clinton\u2014whose office declined comment\u2014will campaign as well.\n\nThe White House is also working closely with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee on a full email and direct mail fundraising effort. This effort, sources familiar with the planning say, is part of a \"comprehensive effort\" for the 2014 midterm effort that will include House and governors' races.\n\nAt a meeting at Nationals Park last week, Obama told Senate Democrats that his health care law would be the \"No. 1 attack tool\" on Democrats by the Koch Brothers. He acknowledged his unpopularity in some states and offered to help where he could.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the Senate majority whip, said, \"He said, 'I understand in some of your states I'm not the most popular politician.' So if you're going to break from the White House on an issue or a position, understood. But I can help many of you, even in states where I'm not popular with everyone. I can still help, and I'm willing to do everything I can.\"\n\nSen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who is trying to defend his seat, downplayed the role any surrogate would play in his campaign, even though Clinton has already helped with fundraising. \"I don't get people to come and campaign for me very often,\" Pryor said. \"To me, in Arkansas, people don't vote for you because somebody else says vote for you.\"\n\nBiden was a previously unreported attendee in an Oval Office meeting last week with Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), DSCC Chairman Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and DSCC Executive Director Guy Cecil. The White House is reportedly debating how and where to deploy the first lady. In 2012, many of her events on behalf of the president's reelection were focused on voter registration, and she could help promote turnout and energize the Democratic base without endangering candidates by a close connection to the president\u2014particularly in places like New Orleans, where local turnout could make the difference for Sen. Mary Landrieu.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said, \"They will help us a lot\u2014in lots of different ways. I think they're both committed to doing everything they can to help us.\" When asked if Michelle Obama would campaign for Senate Democrats, Bennet said, \"I certainly would hope so. I certainly would love it if she did, but she has other responsibilities, too.\"\n\nThe president is still likely to hit the trail at some point later this year, although decisions have yet to be made. He has a busy travel schedule in February and March focused on international affairs, including a California summit with the king of Jordan and trips to Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Vatican City, where he'll meet Pope Francis.",
    " Title: US Officials Believe Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 Likely Downed by Iranian Missile, According to Multiple Reports\n\nArticle:\n\nMultiple reports on Thursday suggest that US officials believe Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was likely shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile. The incident, which occurred early Wednesday, resulted in the death of all 176 people on board.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, US officials stated that it was \"highly likely\" that Iran was responsible for the crash, which took place outside the Iranian capital of Tehran. Defense officials told Newsweek and other outlets that the plane was probably shot down by accident, as Iran's surface-to-air missile systems were likely active at the time of the crash.\n\nCBS News reported that US intelligence detected anti-aircraft radars turning on before the crash and that satellites detected two infrared blips, thought to be SA-15 missiles, that were quickly followed by another blip, the suspected aircraft explosion. CNN confirmed CBS and Newsweek's reporting, and US officials told The Associated Press that it was \"highly likely\" that the aircraft was downed by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on Thursday that he did not believe that the passenger jet went down as a result of a mechanical error. \"It was flying in a pretty rough neighborhood,\" the president said. \"Someone could have made a mistake.\" Trump added, \"I have a feeling that \u2014 it's just some very terrible, something very terrible happened, very devastating.\"\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday afternoon that Canada also had intelligence and evidence from multiple sources indicating \"that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile.\" He added that \"this may well have been unintentional\" and expressed a desire for a full investigation.\n\nImages appearing to show Tor missile fragments, said to have been found outside Tehran, have been circulating on social media. A video making the rounds appears to show the moment a missile struck the Ukrainian aircraft. Iran has denied responsibility, with Iranian media, citing state officials, arguing that the missile theory is \"scientifically impossible\" and \"illogical\" because several domestic and foreign flights were in Iran at the same altitude of 8,000 feet.\n\nUkrainian investigators are considering several possibilities, including the plane being shot down, an engine explosion due to a technical malfunction, a terrorist attack on the flight, or even a collision with an unmanned aerial vehicle. Oleksiy Danylov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, wrote on Facebook earlier Thursday that Ukrainian investigators were considering several possibilities.",
    " Title: \"Church Security: A Growing Concern in the Wake of Charleston Massacre\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, the issue of church security has come to the forefront of national discussions. The attack, considered the worst on an assembled congregation in American history, has prompted concerns about the increasing number of violent attacks on houses of worship.\n\nSince 1999, Carl Chinn, a statistician who documents violent attacks on churches and synagogues, has recorded over 1,000 such incidents, with more than 150 this year alone. The Charleston massacre, according to Chinn, is a calculated attack that underscores the growing trend of violence directed against churches.\n\nTim Miller, a renowned expert in church security and the president of LionHeart International Services Group, shares Chinn's concerns. Miller, a retired Marine and former Secret Service agent, police officer, and counter-intelligence officer, has spent nearly 30 years protecting others. He and his team, which includes former Homeland Security agents, FBI agents, and special-ops personnel, have pivoted their efforts to help churches and non-profits deal with the same threats that were once confined to overseas territories.\n\nChurches, Miller notes, are soft targets, and the Charleston massacre should serve as a wake-up call. \"My first thought was to pray,\" he said, \"having been in situations where that kind of carnage exists \u2013 the suffering is unimaginable. My second thought \u2013 was this is a realization of what we've been talking about and what we help churches prepare for.\"\n\nThe challenge lies in creating a welcoming environment for those in need, while simultaneously preparing for potential acts of violence. \"We welcome you on the one hand \u2013 while on the other hand, if a gunman comes in, we have the resources to handle it,\" Miller explained.\n\nThe Book of Nehemiah, an Old Testament text, seems to address this issue, stating, \"We prayed to our God and posted a guard.\" As the nation grapples with the aftermath of the Charleston massacre, the need for church security is becoming increasingly apparent.",
    " Title: U.S. Navy to Proceed with Review of SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Status Despite Presidential Support\n\nThe U.S. Navy has announced that it will move forward with an administrative review board hearing on December 2nd to consider the potential expulsion of Special Operations Chief Eddie Gallagher from the Navy SEALs, despite President Donald Trump's recent tweet expressing support for the SEAL.\n\nGallagher and three supervising officers were informed of the hearing on Wednesday. The Navy will not be taking away Gallagher's Trident Pin, a symbol of membership in the SEALs, according to Trump's tweet on Thursday.\n\nIn July, Gallagher was acquitted of murdering a wounded Islamic State militant in Iraq in 2017, but was convicted on the single charge of posing with the body of the dead prisoner. Last week, Trump restored Gallagher's rank after he had been demoted to petty officer first class. However, the president did not pardon Gallagher for his offense.\n\nIn a statement issued late Thursday, Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, Chief of Information, said:\n\n\"The Navy follows the lawful orders of the President. We will do so in case of an order to stop the administrative review of SOC Gallagher's professional qualification. We are aware of the President's tweet and are awaiting further guidance.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to an NPR request for comment on the tweet.\n\nGallagher's lawyers claim that Navy brass is seeking to expel him from the SEALs in retaliation for Trump's reversal of his demotion. They have filed a complaint with the Navy Inspector General, alleging that Naval Special Warfare Commander Rear Adm. Collin Green is defying the president.\n\n\"How can Admiral Green credibly preach about preserving good order and discipline while publicly flouting the orders of the commander in chief?\" Gallagher's attorney Timothy Parlatore said, as quoted by the Associated Press.\n\nIf a review board decision goes against Gallagher, he can then appeal to the Navy's Personnel Command.",
    " Title: Vatican Concludes Doctrinal Assessment of Leadership Conference of Women Religious, Marking an End to Five-Year Overhaul\n\nThe Vatican has announced the conclusion of a five-year doctrinal overhaul of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR), the main umbrella group for nuns in the United States. The decision, announced on Thursday, marks the end of a process that began in 2012.\n\nThe Vatican's statement indicates that the Doctrinal Assessment of the LCWR has been accepted, signifying the conclusion of the overhaul. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports this as a sign of Pope Francis' focus on a more merciful church.\n\nDuring their annual visit to Rome, LCWR leaders met with Pope Francis, a meeting that David Gibson of Religion News Service describes as another indicator of the thaw in relations. Both parties have agreed to maintain silence on the matter for the next month, and the joint statement and final report issued Thursday seem to represent a quiet and merciful end to the contentious period between the Vatican and the nuns.\n\nThe Rev. James Martin, SJ, editor at large of the Jesuit magazine America, stated in a Facebook post that the LCWR agreed to implement some changes, mainly regarding speakers and liturgies at its annual conventions. However, overall, the operations of the LCWR remain intact.\n\nJoshua J. McElwee, writing in the National Catholic Reporter, suggests that the news brings to an end what had been an especially contentious period between the women religious and the Vatican. The investigation of the LCWR, which began in 2012 under Cardinal William Levada, the previous head of the Vatican's theological watchdog, had declared that the umbrella group representing most American nuns had strayed from church doctrine and adopted \"radical feminist\" views. Rome ordered Seattle's archbishop to begin monitoring all operations of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious. The investigation called for a five-year doctrinal overhaul of the group.\n\nSister Simone Campbell, head of the Catholic social justice lobby Network, had described the investigation as coming \"like a sock in the stomach\" at the time. A separate Vatican investigation into U.S. nuns ended last December with the Vatican expressing appreciation for the dedicated work of nuns in education, health, and among the poor.",
    " Title: Democrats' Criticism of Trump's Asylum Policies Echoes Obama's 2014 Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Democrats have criticized President Donald Trump over new asylum regulations, which require migrants to claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in, not their preferred country. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) described the regulations as \"illegal\" and \"cruel.\"\n\nHowever, a revisit of former President Barack Obama's statements from five years ago shows a striking similarity in the Democrats' stance on asylum issues. In 2014, Obama stated that poverty and crime are not sufficient legal reasons for granting asylum. He explained that under U.S. law, refugees are admitted based on narrow criteria, and typically, refugees' status is not granted just based on economic need or living in a dangerous neighborhood.\n\nObama further clarified that the American asylum-request pipeline is not designed to handle a large-scale humanitarian asylum crisis. He emphasized, \"I think it's important to recognize that would not necessarily accommodate a large number of additional migrants.\"\n\nThese comments were made following a meeting at the White House with Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina, and El Salvadorian President Salvador Sanchez Ceren, to discuss a migrant crisis that was impacting Central America, Mexico, and the U.S. The crisis was marked by a surge of unaccompanied migrant children that overwhelmed U.S. immigration resources.\n\nThis revelation underscores the evolving nature of political discourse and the shifting goalposts in the debate over asylum policies, as both Democratic and Republican administrations grapple with the complexities of managing a large-scale humanitarian asylum crisis.",
    " Title: Center for Reproductive Rights Releases Controversial Video on 40th Anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Featuring Actor Mehcad Brooks\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights, an organization dedicated to advancing reproductive rights, has released a video to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade. The video features actor Mehcad Brooks, known for his roles in USA Network's \"Necessary Roughness\" and HBO's \"True Blood.\"\n\nThe video has sparked controversy, with some critics arguing that it trivializes the issue of abortion and undermines the role of men in the debate. Critics contend that the video sends a message that men can abandon their responsibilities as fathers by resorting to abortion as a solution.\n\nOne point of contention is the choice of Mehcad Brooks for the video, given the historical context of abortion rights advocacy. Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, has been criticized for her views on race and abortion. Some argue that her beliefs, which included a desire to limit the growth of the black population, are reflected in the high abortion rate within the black community. According to data from the Guttmacher Institute and Census data, black women make up 13 percent of the female population in the United States, yet they account for 30 percent of the abortions performed.\n\nThe video has been met with criticism for its tone, which some find inappropriate and disrespectful. Critics argue that abortion is a serious medical procedure with potential psychological consequences, and the video's lighthearted and celebratory approach is not in line with the gravity of the issue.\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights and Mehcad Brooks have not responded to these criticisms. The video can be found on the Center for Reproductive Rights' website and social media platforms. The organization's stance on abortion remains unchanged, emphasizing the importance of access to safe and legal abortion as a fundamental human right.\n\nThe video has sparked a heated debate, with proponents and critics of abortion rights voicing their opinions on social media and news outlets. The issue is expected to be discussed further on Fox News' \"Hannity\" tonight at 9:40 pm EST.",
    " Title: U.S. Small Business Administration Warns of Imminent Exhaustion of Paycheck Protection Program Funds\n\nThe United States Small Business Administration (SBA) has warned lawmakers that the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a relief initiative designed to support small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, may run out of funds as early as Wednesday. According to reports, the program, which has approved over 1.3 million loans worth nearly $300 billion, is nearing its $349 billion allocation.\n\nThe SBA's announcement comes as the Senate originally legislated $350 billion for the program, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell advocating for additional funding since last week. However, Senate Democrats have blocked this effort, while Senate Republicans have proposed a clean bill to legislate an additional $250 billion to the program.\n\nIn a tweet on April 13, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer emphasized the need for small businesses in rural areas to have access to funds, regardless of their relationship with larger banks. He also criticized the delay in funding, stating, \"Small biz in rural areas should have access to funds even if they're not customers of larger banks.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Schumer have accused the Republican party of delaying the funding, while the GOP has countered these allegations. Pelosi, in a tweet on April 15, stated, \"The Paycheck Protection Program is a crucial tool for protecting workers across the country \u2013 yet serious flaws are keeping far too many small businesses from receiving the resources they need.\"\n\nThe ongoing partisan disagreements could potentially lead to further economic distress for small businesses if additional funding is not legislated promptly. It is crucial for both parties to put aside their political differences and focus on providing the necessary support to small businesses during these challenging times.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking President Obama's Healthcare Reform Promise: A Closer Look at the \"You Can Keep Your Insurance\" Pledge\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of recent media coverage, President Obama's pledge that individuals could keep their insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has come under scrutiny. However, a closer examination reveals that the situation is more complex than it seems.\n\nFirst, it is crucial to understand that the ACA grandfathered all individual policies that were in place at the time the law was enacted. This means that plans that were active during the bill's passage could still be offered, even if they did not meet all the ACA's standards.\n\nThe plans being terminated due to non-compliance with the ACA's minimal standards were all plans introduced after the law's passage. Insurers may not have informed their clients at the time these plans were sold that they would not be available after 2014 because the plans did not comply with the ACA.\n\nIf insurers did not inform their clients that the new plans would only be available for a short period, the blame would seem to rest with the insurance companies, not the ACA. President Obama did not promise people that he would keep insurers from developing new plans that do not comply with the ACA's provisions.\n\nFurthermore, there have been complaints that the grandfathering was too strict. For example, insurers can only raise their premiums or deductibles by a small amount above the rate of medical inflation. As a result, many plans in existence at the time of the ACA are losing their grandfathered status.\n\nIn this case, it is wrong to view insurers as passive actors who are being forced to stop offering plans because of the ACA. The price increases charged by insurers are not events outside of the insurers' control. If an insurer offers a plan with many committed buyers, it would be able to structure its changes in ways that are consistent with the ACA. If it decides not to do so, this is presumably because the insurer has decided that it is not interested in continuing to offer the plan.\n\nAs a practical matter, there are many plans that insurers will opt to drop for market reasons that may or may not have anything to do with the ACA. It's hard to see how this could be viewed as a violation of President Obama's pledge. After all, insurers change and drop plans all the time. Did people who heard Obama's pledge understand it to mean that insurers would no longer have this option once the ACA passed?\n\nIf Obama's pledge was understood as ensuring that every plan that was in existence in 2010 would remain in existence, then it would imply a complete federal takeover of the insurance industry. This would require the government to tell insurers that they must continue to offer plans even if they are losing money on them and even if the plans had lost most of their customers. This would at the least be a strange policy. It would be surprising if many people thought this was the meaning of President Obama's pledge.\n\nFinally, there will be many plans that insurers will stop offering in large part because of the changed market conditions created by the ACA. For example, last week the Washington Post highlighted a plan for the \"hardest to insure\" that was being cancelled by Pathmark Blue Cross of Pennsylvania. This plan is likely being cancelled because it is unable to compete with the insurance being offered through the exchanges. The exchanges charge everyone the same rate regardless of their pre-existing health conditions. A plan that is especially designed for people who have serious health conditions would almost certainly charge a far higher rate. If these high-priced plans no longer exist because they can not compete with the exchanges, would this mean that President Obama had broken his pledge?\n\nOn closer inspection, the claim that President Obama lied in saying that people could keep their insurance looks like another Fox News special. In the only way that the pledge could be interpreted as being meaningful, the pledge is true. The ACA does not eliminate plans that were in existence at the time the bill was approved.\n\nIf we want to play Fox News, President Obama also promised people they could keep their doctor. Since 2010, tens of thousands of doctors have retired or even died. Guess the pledge that people could keep their doctor was yet another lie from the Obama administration.",

The tariffs, which President Trump announced last week, would impose a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican goods beginning on Monday, with the potential to rise to 25 percent by October if Mexico fails to address increasing levels of illegal migration.\n\nTrump's announcement has been met with criticism from Republican senators, who warn that the tariffs could slow the U.S. economy and hinder progress on ratifying the revised North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico. Some GOP senators have even threatened to withhold their support for the tariffs, contrasting their stance on the issue with their earlier support for Trump's national emergency declaration to secure funding for his long-promised border wall.\n\nMexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard is leading the Mexican delegation to the White House, accompanied by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Ebrard has stated that the delegation has spent the past few days preparing for the meeting, which was quickly convened over the weekend.\n\nEbrard emphasized that Mexico is taking steps to address the issue of illegal migration, including increased detention of migrants and other measures designed to prevent them from crossing into the U.S. However, the specific steps Mexico would need to take to prevent the tariffs from taking effect remain unclear, adding to the confusion surrounding the situation.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has stated that the administration wants to see Mexico take action to create a \"vast reduction\" in illegal crossings by tightening security on its border with Guatemala, expanding intelligence sharing with U.S. law enforcement agencies, and cracking down on migrants crossing its northern border with the U.S.\n\nThe economic impact of the proposed tariffs is already being felt, with the private sector adding just 27,000 jobs in May, according to a key study. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank is closely monitoring the situation and may respond by slashing interest rates to prevent widespread damage.\n\nThe diplomatic and economic tensions could slow or stop progress toward the president's NAFTA revision, which Pence has previously vowed would be approved by this summer. The trade pact was signed by the leaders of all three countries last year but must still be ratified by their legislatures. The U.S. and Mexican governments have both started the formal legislative process, but consideration could be delayed with the tariffs in place.\n\nMexico recently became the U.S.'s largest trading partner, with the U.S. importing $346.5 billion in goods from Mexico last year, according to the U.S. trade representative. Automakers, agricultural companies, and retailers are expected to be hit hardest by the duties, which will be paid for by U.S. importers and often passed along to consumers.\n\nThe meeting between Pence and the Mexican officials is set to take place on Wednesday at the White House. The outcome of the meeting remains uncertain, but the stakes are high, as both sides seek to find a solution that addresses the issue of illegal migration while minimizing the potential economic damage of the proposed tariffs.",
    " Title: Boehner Criticizes Obama's Budget Proposal, Accusing It of Lacking Bipartisan Efforts and Failing to Address Spending Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press release on Friday, House Speaker John Boehner criticized the budget proposal President Barack Obama is set to unveil, stating that it takes no steps towards finding common ground with Republicans, despite the president's offer to cut federal entitlement spending.\n\nBoehner argued that the president's proposal, which reportedly includes changes to Social Security and Medicare, similar to an offer Obama made to Boehner during the fiscal cliff negotiations in December, would not be a viable solution. The president's proposal, as described to CNN and other news outlets by senior Obama administration officials, includes a $400 billion cut to Medicare over a decade.\n\nBoehner stated, \"If the president believes these modest entitlement savings are needed to help shore up these programs, there's no reason they should be held hostage for more tax hikes. That's no way to lead and move the country forward.\"\n\nThe speaker also criticized the president's last offer during the fiscal cliff negotiations, stating that it was significantly skewed in favor of higher taxes and included only modest entitlement savings. Boehner further argued that the reported entitlement program changes have also received fire from left-leaning groups who argue the changes would hurt vulnerable individuals.\n\nObama's budget also includes tax increases, which Republicans say is a non-starter since taxes were increased on wealthy individuals as part of the final fiscal cliff deal. Boehner wrote, \"In the end, the president got his tax hikes on the wealthy with no corresponding spending cuts. At some point, we need to solve our spending problem, and what the president has offered would leave us with a budget that never balances.\"\n\nBoehner also suggested that Obama's so-called charm offensive was to little avail on budget matters. \"When the president visited the Capitol last month, House Republicans stated a desire to find common ground and urged him not to make savings we agree upon conditional on another round of tax increases. If reports are accurate, the president has not heeded that call,\" Boehner said.\n\nRepublicans have roundly criticized Obama for missing the February deadline for submitting his budget proposal. The proposal could be released next week, White House officials have said. The Republican-led House has previously passed a proposal drafted by Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. It was a budget not warmly received by the Democratic Senate or the White House.",
    " Title: Trump-Erdogan Meeting Fails to Resolve NATO Ally Dispute Over Air Defense Systems\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In a meeting Wednesday at the White House, President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan failed to reach an agreement on Turkey's decision to accept delivery of a Russian air defense system, a move that has strained relations between the two NATO allies.\n\nThe U.S. suspended Turkish participation in the multinational F-35 fighter jet program due to the threat posed by the Russian S-400 system. Despite the disagreement, Trump and Erdogan agreed to continue discussions on the issue.\n\n\"The acquisition of the S-400 creates some very serious challenges for us,\" Trump said. \"Hopefully we'll be able to resolve that situation.\"\n\nTrade between the two countries, which amounted to about $24 billion in 2017, was another topic of discussion. Trump expressed optimism about increasing trade to about $100 billion between the two countries.\n\nThe dispute over the competing air defense systems is a major component of the tension between the two countries. Turkey has also faced criticism for its incursion into Syria last month to attack Kurdish forces that fought with the U.S. against the Islamic State, and for repression of political opponents, journalists, and others.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) acknowledged Turkey's concerns regarding certain Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces, but said they should be addressed by creating a safe zone and not with a \"disruptive\" incursion that \"must end.\"\n\nTurkey, meanwhile, is angered at the U.S. for supporting the Kurdish forces it views as a threat and for refusing to extradite a Muslim cleric it accuses of fomenting a 2016 coup attempt against Erdogan.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said lawmakers have significant concerns about both the S-400 and the attack on the Kurds, who \"have risked a lot to stand with America\" and battle the Islamic State.\n\nThe leaders' meeting came amid the ongoing House impeachment inquiry, with Trump saying he was too busy to watch the televised hearings, which he called a \"hoax.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats criticized Trump for meeting with Erdogan after the invasion of Syria, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) calling it \"mindboggling\" and \"appalling.\"\n\nIn the Senate, two Democrats have introduced legislation denouncing Turkey's targeting of journalists, political opponents, dissidents, minorities, and others. They said the Turkish government had imprisoned more than 80,000 Turkish citizens, closed more than 1,500 non-governmental organizations on terrorism-related grounds, and dismissed or suspended more than 130,000 civil servants from their jobs.\n\nDuring the news conference, Trump joked that Erdogan should only call on a friendly Turkish reporter. When Erdogan called on a female Turkish reporter, according to several people in the room, Graham leaned over and quietly told someone seated next to him, \"She's the only reporter left over there\" in Turkey.",
    " Title: New York Financial Regulator Proposes Enhanced Cybersecurity Measures to Protect Against Potential \"Armageddon-Type\" Cyber Attacks\n\nIn a speech at Columbia Law School on Wednesday, Ben Lawsky, head of New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS), expressed concerns about the potential for a large-scale cyber attack on Wall Street firms that could have far-reaching implications for the broader economy. Lawsky likened such an event to the mortgage meltdown of 2008 and stated that he is considering new rules to protect against this potential threat.\n\nLawsky's proposed measures include forcing banks and insurance companies regulated by DFS to improve their cybersecurity defenses. DFS has regulatory oversight over dozens of New York-licensed banks and insurance companies, including Goldman Sachs, MetLife, and Barclays. As head of DFS, Lawsky has the power to impose penalties for bad behavior and to set new standards for the operations of these financial institutions.\n\nTo prevent a devastating cyber attack, Lawsky wants to incorporate cybersecurity into the grades DFS gives the banks and insurance companies it regulates. Financial firms \"care deeply\" about their grades because they can impact their ability to pay dividends or acquire other companies, Lawsky said.\n\nLawsky is also considering mandating multifactor authentication systems for employees of DFS-regulated financial firms. He believes that single-step passwords are outdated and should no longer be used.\n\nIn addition, Lawsky may require banks and insurance companies licensed by DFS to obtain guarantees from third-party vendors that their security meets certain standards. These vendors can often serve as a \"backdoor entrance\" for hackers, Lawsky said.\n\nLawsky's call for enhanced cybersecurity measures follows a report last week by Moscow-based security firm Kaspersky Lab, which warned of a group of international cybercriminals who have stolen up to $1 billion from 100 banks across 30 countries by infiltrating their internal systems.\n\nIn his speech, Lawsky also touched on new rules he is considering to combat money laundering. These rules include random audits for DFS-licensed banks to assess how well they flag suspicious transactions, as well as requiring bank executives to certify that their money transaction monitoring is up to par to better protect against terrorism and other crimes.\n\nLawsky's office has discovered that some banks do not take monitoring of financial transactions seriously. Indeed, British bank Standard Chartered found itself in hot water recently after Lawsky accused it of turning a blind eye to money laundering. In August, the bank agreed to settle its dispute with DFS by paying $300 million and cutting off dealings with certain customers that were flagged for their suspicious transactions.\n\nLawsky stated that DFS caught Standard Chartered by comparing the company's flagging of suspicious transactions with its own system for finding suspicious activity. \"We basically ran the company's transactions through our own filtering system and compared the results,\" Lawsky said, noting that regulators typically rely on self-reporting from the firms they oversee.\n\n\"What regulators have not done is actively tested the effectiveness of the filtering systems banks are using. That needs to change,\" Lawsky said.",
    " Title: Democrats and Republicans Gear Up for 2018 Midterm Elections: A Tight Race for Senate Seats and House Control\n\nThe 2018 midterm elections are rapidly approaching, and the political landscape is shaping up to be a tight race, with the balance of power in both the Senate and the House of Representatives hanging in the balance. The question of whether the Republicans will maintain their hold on power or if the political pendulum is swinging in the Democrats' favor remains unanswered, as tight polling in many states means the outcome won't be settled until Election Day in November.\n\nOne aspect that is certain is that Democrats will be on the defensive, as they hold 22 of the 33 Senate seats up for grabs, while Republicans hold just eight. Independents hold the remaining two seats. In an effort to bolster their chances, Democrats are reportedly calling in high-profile reinforcements, including former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, admitted last week that Democratic candidates running for Senate are welcoming the support of Obama and the Clintons. \"We welcome support from everybody who wants to help, including Secretary Clinton and President Obama,\" he said, according to the Washington Examiner. \"As the head of the DSCC, we welcome those individuals and everybody that wants to help.\"\n\nClinton has already been reaching out to campaigns, according to Hollen. The twice-failed presidential candidate started \"Onward Together\" last year, an organization focused on electing Democrats nationwide. \"I think she's going to continue to reach out to candidates and let them know that she's ready to help in any way that she can,\" Van Hollen said. \"These are really conversations that go on between Secretary Clinton or President Obama and the particular campaign.\"\n\nIn the House of Representatives, every seat is up for grabs each election cycle, and if Democrats want to re-take control, they have some work to do. Currently, Republicans have a 42-seat majority. However, in California, at least, the national party is facing a potential self-inflicted disaster, as the New York Times reports. The mushrooming political chaos across Southern California has led national Democrats to pour millions of dollars into congressional races to avert a loss of seats or a lack of competitiveness against the more organized Republicans.\n\nIn summary, the 2018 midterm elections are shaping up to be a critical contest for both parties, with Democrats on the defensive in the Senate and facing potential self-inflicted wounds in California's House races. The outcome of these elections will determine the balance of power in Congress for the next several election cycles.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Republican Strategy on Healthcare: A Delicate Balance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that signals a potential shift in the political landscape, President Trump has assigned three Republican senators the task of devising a replacement for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) if the courts rule against it. This contingency plan, while prudent, has sparked debate within the Republican party, with some senators expressing reluctance to take up the assignment.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a recent press conference, hinted at a wait-and-see approach, suggesting that the Senate would only engage in health care reform once the White House and the Democrats reach a deal. This strategy, according to Republican strategists, is a calculated move to avoid presenting a Republican health-care plan open to attack, and instead focus on criticizing Democratic proposals.\n\nHowever, this strategy may not be as effective as intended. The reluctance to propose a health-care plan could provide Democrats with ammunition to accuse Republicans of abandoning a crucial issue and seeking to eliminate a health law relied upon by millions. The choice for Republicans, then, is whether to counter this attack with their own plan or to let Democrats create a caricatured conservative plan to associate with them.\n\nThe passage of a conservative health-care plan through a Democratic House seems unlikely, and a bipartisan compromise may be challenging to achieve. Yet, the lack of a Republican health-care plan during the Obama administration, when they had the power to enact legislation, is a point of criticism. The absence of a consensus among Republican politicians and voters left them unprepared when they regained power.\n\nThe key innovation of Obamacare was not the subsidization of health-insurance purchases, but the centralization of health-insurance regulation in Washington, D.C. This centralization, and the accompanying curtailment of choice and increase in costs, is what Republicans tasked with replacing Obamacare should now work to undo.\n\nA possible solution could involve the federal government removing many of Obamacare's regulations and redirecting the money currently flowing to Obamacare's exchanges and Medicaid expansions to state governments. These state governments would then determine how to spend the funds to meet their residents' health-care needs.\n\nThis approach would allow states to allocate funds to different groups, such as disabled Medicaid recipients, or to let Medicaid recipients use a share of the Obamacare money to buy insurance on the private market. States could also attempt to increase coverage rates among the young by allowing insurers to offer them discounts.\n\nRepublican officeholders are encouraged to contribute their ideas to this basic template or propose wholly different ideas. The goal is to ensure that Republicans do not simply hold off the next Democrat-led lurch to the left for a few years, and that conservatives do not let them. President Trump's challenge to his party, despite its reception, is a welcome one.",
    " Title: Senate to Vote on Federal Reserve Audit Legislation in 2015\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift, the Senate is set to vote on legislation next year that would force a comprehensive audit of the Federal Reserve's decision-making process. The bill, championed by former Rep. Ron Paul and now backed by his son, Sen. Rand Paul, and other lawmakers, has the support of the new Republican majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell.\n\nThe legislation, which has already passed twice in the House, is not guaranteed success in the Senate, despite its bipartisan support. The Federal Reserve itself is pushing back against the proposed audit, with Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen stating earlier this month that the Fed remains opposed to stricter oversight of its monetary policy decisions.\n\nYellen argued that the Fed's monetary policy decision-making should remain exempt from GAO audits, citing a 1978 law that explicitly prohibits such audits. However, supporters of the audit argue that the Federal Reserve's role in the 2009 Recovery Act, which totaled $800 billion, pales in comparison to the trillions of dollars in stimulus the Federal Reserve oversaw.\n\nThe bill has garnered significant support in the House, passing twice, including most recently in September on a 333-92 vote. All but one Republican, and more than half of the Democrats in the chamber, voted for the legislation. However, the bill was blocked by former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in 2012 and 2014, a move that has been criticized by supporters of the audit.\n\nWith the change in Senate leadership, the bill now has a better chance of reaching the floor for a vote. Norm Singleton, vice president of policy at Campaign for Liberty, a political organization founded by Ron Paul, said, \"His refusal to bring popular legislation like 'Audit the Fed' to the floor is a major reason why he's being demoted to minority leader.\"\n\nHowever, Singleton cautioned that the bill's success is not guaranteed, especially in light of reports that Fed officials are lobbying against the audit push. \"This is popular with 75 percent of the American people, but it's not popular among Wall Street; it's not popular among banks; it's not popular among foreign central banks,\" he said. \"These hold a fair amount of sway among both parties, so just to say that a change in party necessarily means we'll be able to move Audit the Fed, it's better odds now than we've had before, but it's not a slam dunk.\"\n\nSen. Paul's office has confirmed that the bill will be among the first pieces of legislation introduced when the new Congress convenes in January. Transparency at the Federal Reserve remains a top priority for Sen. Rand Paul. The Federal Reserve, established nearly a century ago, acts as the lender of last resort to the country's banking system and is charged with fighting inflation and promoting economic growth and employment. The interest rates it sets have a direct impact on the rates that banks charge consumers. However, some of the board's decision-making has been shielded from view to give the agency independence.\n\nThe audit legislation would grant the Government Accountability Office the power to retroactively review the Fed's decision-making, particularly on monetary policy. Ms. Yellen and her defenders argue that giving the GAO audit powers could amount to having their decisions scrutinized almost in real time, which they say could influence the closed-door deliberations by the Fed. Critics of the Fed's actions argue that increased transparency is necessary to ensure accountability and prevent future financial crises.",
    " Title: Trump and Schiff Engage in Twitter Spat as Democrats Push for Release of Memo Countering GOP's Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, President Donald Trump took aim at Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, accusing him of being a liar and leaker. The tweet comes as Democrats push to release a memo that is expected to counter a Republican document alleging FBI surveillance abuses.\n\nTrump tweeted, \"Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!\"\n\nIn response, Schiff tweeted, \"Mr. President, I see you've had a busy morning of 'Executive Time.' Instead of tweeting false smears, the American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or... really anything else.\"\n\nTrump did not provide evidence that Schiff has illegally leaked confidential information. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, Democrats plan to offer a motion at a Monday business meeting to release their memo. If approved, the matter would be sent to Trump, who would have five days to object to its release.\n\nThe four-page GOP memo, spearheaded by Chairman Devin Nunes of California, alleges that the FBI improperly used information paid for in part by Hillary Clinton's campaign to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant for then-Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. Trump has said the memo \"totally vindicates\" him in the Russia probe.\n\nAt last week's meeting, Republicans blocked a Democratic attempt to release their memo at the same time as the Nunes memo. Republicans argued they had just been presented with a copy of the Democrats' document.\n\nRepublicans have since said they would vote to release the Democratic memo, drafted by Schiff, a sign that the committee is likely to approve its release.\n\nIn a separate tweet, Trump praised Nunes, saying, \"Representative Devin Nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump and Schiff marks the latest development in the ongoing political battle between the two parties over the Russia investigation and the handling of the FBI and Department of Justice.",
    " Title: Trump Defends Steel Tariffs Amidst Global Outcry and Potential Trade War Escalation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has defended his decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, stating that \"trade wars are good and easy to win.\" The announcement, which has been met with criticism from manufacturers and trade partners in China and Europe, will see tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum for an extended period.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, Trump asserted, \"When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win.\" The formal order is expected to be signed next week, but details, including any product or country exemptions, have yet to be disclosed.\n\nThe planned tariffs, justified on the grounds of cut-price metal imports harming both American producers and national security, have raised the prospect of reciprocal restrictions on American exports and increased prices for domestic users. While the practical impact may be limited, the political environment for global trade has taken a turn for the worse.\n\nThe response in China, the world's largest steel producer, has been muted, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying merely urging the U.S. to follow trade rules. Industry insiders, however, have been less restrained. Wen Xianjun, vice chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, stated that the U.S. measures \"overturn the international trade order.\"\n\nU.S. allies, seeing their industries threatened, have responded with bafflement and dismay. Some also question the idea that metal imports pose a threat to national security. Japan's Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko stated, \"Steel and aluminum imports from Japan, which is an ally, do not affect U.S. national security at all.\"\n\nThe European Union has vowed to \"react firmly\" with World Trade Organization-compliant countermeasures, while Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel to the U.S., has called the measures unacceptable. Australian Trade Minister Steve Ciobo called the move \"disappointing\" and seeks an exemption.\n\nTrump maintains that the tariffs will level the unfair playing field and make it easier for American companies to expand and hire workers. However, U.S. companies that use aluminum for manufacturing and packaging, such as MillerCoors and Hershey Co., have expressed concerns that operations will be negatively impacted by the tariffs.\n\nThe potential for retaliation, particularly from China, is a concern. China has already launched a probe into U.S. imports of sorghum and is studying whether to restrict shipments of U.S. soybeans, targets that could hurt Trump's support in some farming states. While China accounts for just a fraction of U.S. imports of the metals, it is accused of flooding the global market and dragging down prices.\n\nThe extent of the impact hinges on which nations will be affected, according to Alex Wolf, senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong who previously worked at the U.S. State Department. \"It's not much ado about nothing, but until we see the final scope of the tariffs and the response from global trading partners, it's hard to say it's the start of a tit-for-tat trade war,\" he said.",
    " Title: Senators Rubio and Feinstein Warn of ISIS Expansionist Threat to U.S. Homeland\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a chilling assessment, Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) have issued warnings about the potential expansionist threat posed by the jihadist ISIS group, suggesting that their ideology could lead to attacks on the United States.\n\nRubio, a member of the Senate's Foreign Relations and Select Intelligence Committees, has stated that President Barack Obama was right to use military force to protect America's diplomats and military personnel in Iraq. However, he argues that this should not be the only goal. In a piece published on Friday, Rubio warns that if decisive action against ISIS is not taken now, it will not only be Iraqis or Syrians who suffer, but Americans as well, due to a potential terrorist attack on U.S. soil or on U.S. personnel overseas.\n\nRubio's warning mirrors that of Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, who has also expressed concern about the recruitment of fighters in Western countries by ISIS. In a statement backing Obama's airstrike authorization, Feinstein stated, \"It has become clear that ISIL is recruiting fighters in Western countries, training them to fight its battles in the Middle East and possibly returning them to European and American cities to attack us in our backyard.\"\n\nBoth senators call for an increase in military and humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Regional Government. They argue that inaction is no longer an option, and that a broader military campaign against ISIS is necessary to prevent the group from establishing safe havens and launching attacks on the United States and its allies.\n\nISIS, which emerged from al Qaeda, has already established a presence in Iraq, even as they seize Iraqi towns and communities. Rubio asserts that ISIS, with thousands of foreign fighters, many of them from the West, will not rest after taking the Kurdish capital of Irbil or Baghdad. He warns that their expansionist ideology will lead them to attack U.S. allies in the region and eventually Europe and the United States.\n\nIn conclusion, the warnings issued by Senators Rubio and Feinstein highlight the urgent need for the United States to take decisive action against ISIS to prevent potential attacks on U.S. soil and protect its allies in the region. The senators' calls for increased military and humanitarian assistance to Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government underscore the importance of a coordinated international response to the threat posed by ISIS.",
    " Title: Clinton Accuses Trump of Ties to Alt-Right Movement, Stirring Controversy Ahead of Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange this week, the two presidential candidates have been trading accusations of racism and bigotry, with Hillary Clinton arguing that Donald Trump's rhetoric and policies are an invitation to the \"alt-right\" movement.\n\nDuring a speech in Reno, Nevada on Thursday, Clinton stated, \"This is not conservatism as we have known it. This is not Republicanism as we have known it. These are racist ideas. These are race-baiting ideas. Anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-women ideas \u2013 all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the 'alt-right.'\"\n\nThe views of the alt-right are widely seen as anti-Semitic and white supremacist. This mostly online movement uses websites, chat boards, social media, and memes to spread its message. The infamous Star of David image that Trump received criticism for retweeting was reportedly first seen on an alt-right message board.\n\nMost of its members are young white men who see themselves first and foremost as champions of their own demographic. Their greatest points of unity lie in what they are against: multiculturalism, immigration, feminism, and, above all, political correctness.\n\n\"They see political correctness really as the greatest threat to their liberty,\" Nicole Hemmer, University of Virginia professor and author of a forthcoming book Messengers of the Right, explained on Morning Edition. \"So, they believe saying racist or anti-Semitic things \u2014 it's not an act of hate, but an act of freedom.\"\n\nThe alt-right movement differs from what we think of as traditional conservatism. The movement's origins are traced to many conservatives' opposition to the policies of President George W. Bush, especially the U.S. invasion of Iraq (alt-righters are strictly isolationist). They are also suspicious of free markets, a key tenet of conservatism, as they believe that business interests can often be in conflict with what they view as higher ideals \u2014 those of cultural preservation and homogeneity.\n\nTwo self-proclaimed leaders of the alt-right movement \u2014 Breitbart's Allum Bokhari and Milo Yiannopoulos \u2014 recently outlined a manifesto of sorts for what the group believes and who their allies are and are not. It claimed that \"beltway conservatives\" hate alt-right adherents even more \"than Democrats or loopy progressives.\"\n\nThey see themselves, rather, as \"natural conservatives,\" with an \"instinctive wariness of the foreign and the unfamiliar,\" Bokhari and Yiannopoulos wrote.\n\nLast week, the GOP presidential nominee announced that Stephen Bannon, chairman of Breitbart News Network, which Bannon has called \"the platform for the alt-right,\" would be his campaign's new chief executive.\n\n\"By putting Breitbart front and center in his campaign,\" said Hemmer, \"Trump has elevated the alt-right.\"\n\nHowever, Hemmer suspects that Trump \u2014 and all but a small fraction of his supporters \u2014 do not pledge allegiance to the alt-right movement. \"I think they are attracted to Trump [and] see him as a vessel for getting their ideas out there,\" Hemmer said.\n\nClinton is likely to continue drawing a link between Trump and the alt-right in the minds of voters. \"She's reminding those undecided voters that whatever the new moderate face of Donald Trump might be,\" Hemmer said, \"there are the things he has said and here are the implications of the things he said and the people who he's brought into his campaign.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding the alt-right movement and its ties to the Trump campaign is likely to continue as the presidential race heats up, with both candidates seeking to appeal to their respective bases and win over undecided voters.",
    " Title: \"Federal Health Care Exchange: Initial Enrollment Figures Revealed Amidst Rollout Challenges\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has disclosed that a total of 6 individuals had successfully enrolled in the federal health care exchange by October 2, according to documents obtained by the committee. The documents, which include notes from a \"war room\" meeting at the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance, underscore the initial challenges faced by the online marketplace, HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe documents indicate that the six enrolled individuals were issued policies from five different insurance companies. Healthcare Service Corporation, one of the insurers, reported two enrollments. By the next meeting, held that afternoon, approximately 100 enrollments had taken place since the launch of the federal exchange.\n\nHowever, the documents do not represent an official enrollment tally, according to Joanne Peters, a Health and Human Services spokeswoman. The department has declined to release the number of Americans who have successfully enrolled in the exchange.\n\nPeters stated, \"We will release enrollment statistics on a monthly basis after coordinating information from different sources such as paper, online, and call centers, verifying with insurers and collecting data from states.\"\n\nPeters reiterated that a slow start does not mean that the exchange will not attract a significant number of enrollees by the deadline. \"We have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period,\" she said.\n\nCiting the quiet pace at which Massachusetts residents registered for that state's health program, the spokeswoman remained confident that enrollment totals would increase as more people learn about the exchange.\n\nThe Center for Consumer Information and Insurance is part of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Despite the initial challenges, HHS remains focused on providing accurate enrollment totals and cannot yet give those figures due to collection issues.\n\n\"We have had more than 20 million visitors to the Marketplace, showing an overwhelming interest in Americans learning more about their options for affordable health care,\" Peters concluded.",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Aspirants Take Aim at Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire GOP Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of New Hampshire, the Republican presidential hopefuls gathered for the state GOP's two-day summit, with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, being the central focus of their speeches. The event, held in Nashua, attracted nearly the entire field, with each candidate taking turns to criticize Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, her email server controversy, and her handling of foreign policy, particularly the 2012 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi.\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul delivered the strongest attack on Clinton, accusing her of dereliction of duty and suggesting that her actions should disqualify her from holding high office. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker questioned Clinton's understanding of everyday life, stating that she may not have ever been to a store like Kohl's.\n\nHillary Clinton is scheduled to visit New Hampshire on Monday and Tuesday, but for the weekend, the political world's attention was on the Republicans in Nashua. The Clinton surrogate at the event was former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina, whose speech was light on substance but managed to grab attention with her allusion to the Monica Lewinsky scandal and a jab at the idea that only men should be elected President.\n\nPolicy differences were also a topic of discussion, with Paul taking on his own party over Libya, stating that the U.S. should never have waded into the conflict in the first place. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz advocated for a more muscular role in the Middle East.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio managed to weave a compelling narrative, tying his Cuban immigrant parents' pursuit of the American dream to his efforts to save it for his daughters. Rubio positioned 2016 as a \"referendum on our national identity,\" stating that his children and their generation would be \"the first to inherit a diminished country from their parents.\"\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush attempted to assuage primary voters' concerns about a potential Clinton vs. Bush general election, stating, \"I don't see any coronation coming my way, trust me.\" He also showcased his policy chops, distancing himself from Common Core standards, expressing support for \"traditional marriage,\" and highlighting his eight years as a conservative Florida governor as an advantage over his rivals.\n\nThe event also featured a charm offensive from Sen. Lindsey Graham, whose quick wit and South Carolina drawl were on full display. Real estate mogul Donald Trump managed to both insult and win the audience's applause with his candid remarks about running for president. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, despite a compelling personal story and policy chops, was largely forgettable, lacking a standout quality.",
    " Title: Justice Department Declines to Investigate Trump-Zelensky Call, Citing Insufficient Evidence for Quid Pro Quo Scheme\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. - The Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced that it will not be launching an investigation into the July phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which sparked a formal impeachment inquiry over allegations of a quid pro quo arrangement.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec stated, \"Relying on established procedures set forth in the Justice Manual, the Department's Criminal Division reviewed the official record of the call and determined, based on the facts and applicable law, that there was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was warranted.\"\n\nThe statement continued, \"All relevant components of the Department agreed with this legal conclusion, and the Department has concluded the matter.\"\n\nDuring the July 25 phone call, Trump reportedly asked Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, over allegations that the former vice president used his position to help a Ukrainian energy company avoid a corruption probe soon after Hunter was appointed to its board of directors.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump admitted to temporarily withholding military aid from Ukraine, which was intended to help the country counter Russian aggression. This admission has fueled suspicions of a quid pro quo scheme, as a foreign national, Zelensky, would have been providing Trump's campaign assistance in the form of opposition research on his chief political rival, Joe Biden.\n\nThe White House released a partial transcript of the call on Wednesday, revealing that Trump did indeed ask Zelensky to help Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani investigate Biden's influence in firing a Ukrainian prosecutor.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint, submitted by an anonymous member of the intelligence community to the Director of National Intelligence's inspector general in August, was based on the July call. The DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel released an opinion on Wednesday stating that the whistleblower complaint was not an \"urgent concern\" and challenged the idea that the complaint must be sent to the congressional intelligence committees.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday, Senate Republicans unanimously approved a non-binding measure proposed by Democrats calling on the Trump administration to turn the complaint over to Congress. The ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump is being led by the House of Representatives.",
    " Title: Trump Steps Down from Business Empire to Focus on Presidential Duties\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets before dawn on Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced his decision to step down from his multi-million dollar business empire to focus solely on his role as the nation's new commander-in-chief.\n\n\"I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to make America great again,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe president-elect explained that he felt it was important, as president, to avoid any potential conflict of interest with his various businesses. He is not legally mandated to do so, but he believes this move will help maintain transparency and integrity in his presidency.\n\nThe news comes as the Trump transition continues, with more cabinet picks, a flurry of activity on Twitter, and a significant victory on job creation. This week, Trump Tower has seen a steady stream of visitors, hinting at high-powered auditions for cabinet posts.\n\nAmong the latest selections are Steven Mnuchin for treasury secretary, who, if confirmed by the Senate, will play a key role in shaping Trump's tax policy. Wilbur Ross, a Wall Street financier, was chosen to lead the Commerce Department. Elaine Chao, who served as labor secretary under George W. Bush and is the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky), was announced as the secretary of transportation.\n\nRobert Johnson, the founder of BET, was offered a post but declined, citing his preference to remain an entrepreneur rather than enter government bureaucracy. Johnson also stated that he does not believe Trump is a racist or anti-African-American.\n\nThe question on everyone's mind is who will be chosen for the position of secretary of state. Trump has been meeting with potential candidates, and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn) commented that the secretary of state's role is crucial to a president, and he needs to choose someone he is very comfortable with.\n\nTrump also had dinner with Mitt Romney on Tuesday, despite Romney's criticism during the campaign. Romney has since praised Trump for his election victory and his \"message of inclusion.\"\n\nOther potential candidates for the top diplomat position include Gen. David Petraeus, former CIA director.\n\nTrump stirred up a Twitter storm on Tuesday with a tweet suggesting that anyone who burns the American flag should face consequences, such as loss of citizenship or a year in jail. The Supreme Court has ruled that flag burning is constitutionally protected speech.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is already making good on a campaign promise to keep jobs in America. The air conditioning company Carrier Corp. announced that it has reached a deal with the president-elect to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana, rather than moving to Mexico as previously planned.\n\nThis move is a sign that Trump intends to deliver quickly on his key campaign promises, which include repealing the Affordable Care Act, fixing the immigration system, strengthening the economy by cutting taxes and government regulations, and bringing back jobs.",
    " Title: Federal Court Unseals Fusion GPS Bank Records, Revealing Details of Payments and Journalist Connections\n\nA federal court in Washington, D.C., unsealed documents in a lawsuit over Fusion GPS's bank records on Tuesday, providing new details of payments made last year to the opposition research firm that commissioned the infamous Trump dossier. The documents also shed light on requests made by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence about payments that Fusion GPS made to journalists.\n\nThe records, unsealed in response to a ruling made last week by Richard Leon, a federal judge in the district court in Washington, D.C., reveal transactions between two law firms that Fusion GPS worked with last year on two Russia-related projects.\n\nPerkins Coie, the law firm that represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, paid Fusion GPS a total of $1,024,408 between May 24, 2016, and Dec. 28, 2016. The largest payment was made just before the election, with Perkins Coie making a $365,275 payment to Fusion GPS on Oct. 28, 2016. A payment made to Fusion in late-December is later than previously thought.\n\nThe transaction list does not show payments that Fusion made to Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier. Fusion reportedly paid Steele a total of $168,000 for his work, which lasted from June 2016 until the election.\n\nThe records show that Fusion was also paid $523,651 by the law firm BakerHostetler between March 7, 2016, and Oct. 31, 2016. Fusion worked for BakerHostetler to investigate Bill Browder, a London-based banker who helped push through the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law vehemently opposed by the Kremlin.\n\nBakerHostetler represented Prevezon Holdings and its owner, a Russian businessman named Denis Katsyv. Katsyv and Prevezon sought to limit the impact of the Magnitsky sanctions.\n\nGlenn Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter and Fusion GPS founding partner, compiled the research for the anti-Browder project. He worked closely with Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who also showed up at the infamous Trump Tower meeting held on June 9, 2016. Simpson's research ended up in the Trump Tower meeting in the form of a four-page memo carried by Veselnitskaya. She also shared Simpson's work with Yuri Chaika, the prosecutor general of Russia.\n\nSimpson testified this week that he did not know that Veselnitskaya provided the Browder information to Chaika or to Donald Trump Jr., the Trump campaign's point-man in the Trump Tower meeting. Simpson also stated that he did not know that Veselnitskaya had visited Trump Tower until it was reported in the press earlier this year.\n\nThe unsealed documents also reveal details of the House committee's requests for records related to Fusion's payments to journalists. The document shows that the committee sought records related to \"five Fusion payments to research and Russia expert [name redacted]\" and the production of three additional payments. The committee also seeks records \"related to Fusion's payments to journalists who have reported on Russia issues relevant to its investigation.\"\n\nIn a memo filed Tuesday, lawyers for the House panel stated that they are seeking transactions related to nine payments made to \"three individual journalists...each of whom have reported on and/or been quoted in articles regarding topics related to the Committee's investigation, some of which were published as recently as October 2017.\" The names of the journalists are redacted in the filing.\n\nIt is not clear from the requests whether Fusion GPS paid active journalists for their work. The firm is known to employ a stable of former reporters. Simpson and his two founding partners, Peter Fritsch and Thomas Catan, worked together at The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe unsealed filings show that Fusion argued against releasing records related to payments to journalists. In a Nov. 3 declaration, Fritsch argued that \"transactions between Fusion GPS and certain journalists...are not pertinent to work related to Russia or Donald Trump.\" And in a Nov. 2 email to the Intel committee's legal team, Levy argued that \"records related to payments to the journalists and 'individuals' are protected by the First Amendment and confidentiality, and they are not pertinent.\"",
    " Title: Justice Department Drops Charges Against John Edwards, Ending High-Profile Corruption Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Justice Department announced on Wednesday that it will not be retrying former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, following a federal judge's declaration of a mistrial in his corruption case two weeks ago. The department's decision was formalized with an \"order for dismissal\" filed in the U.S. District Court in North Carolina, dismissing the remaining five counts against Edwards on which the jury had been deadlocked.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, in a statement, explained that the government has decided not to retry Edwards \"in the interest of justice.\" Breuer defended the department's decision to prosecute the case, stating, \"We knew that this case -- like all campaign finance cases -- would be challenging. But it is our duty to bring hard cases when we believe that the facts and the law support charging a candidate for high office with a crime.\"\n\nBreuer further noted, \"Last month, the government put forward its best case against Mr. Edwards, and I am proud of the skilled and professional way in which our prosecutors conducted this trial. The jurors could not reach a unanimous verdict on five of the six counts of the indictment, however, and we respect their judgment.\"\n\nEdwards' attorneys, Abbe Lowell, Allison Van Laningham, and Alan Duncan, welcomed the decision in a joint written statement. They stated, \"While John has repeatedly admitted to his sins, he has also consistently asserted, as we demonstrated at the trial, that he did not violate any campaign law nor even imagined that any campaign laws could apply.\"\n\nThe attorneys further added, \"We are confident that the outcome of any new trial would have been the same. We are very glad that, after living under this cloud for over three years, John and his family can have their lives back and enjoy the peace they deserve.\"\n\nJudge Catherine Eagles had declared a mistrial two weeks ago when the jury was unable to reach a verdict on most of the counts alleging Edwards accepted illegal campaign contributions. Prosecutors had tried to prove that hush money sent to his mistress by wealthy donors during the 2008 presidential campaign constituted illegal donations.\n\nHowever, Edwards' lawyers maintained throughout the trial that the money was intended to hide his affair from his wife Elizabeth, who has since passed away from cancer, and not from voters. Edwards himself, after the trial, stated, \"I do not believe I did anything illegal, but 'I did an awful, awful lot that was wrong.'\"",
    " Title: Republican Senator Jeff Sessions Accuses Obama Administration of Failing to Enforce Century-Old Immigration Law on Public Charge\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, has accused the Obama administration of failing to enforce a century-old law meant to prevent immigrants from taking root in the U.S. and relying on government welfare. The administration reported that no one was cited for this violation last year.\n\nSessions argued that \"virtually no one\" is being examined before they enter the country to determine if they will immediately begin to depend on government welfare. He stated that any immigration reform package \"has got to end that.\"\n\nLast week, Sessions presented new statistics from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that he described as a startling trend. DHS reported that relatively few immigrants are being turned away on the grounds that they are likely to become a \"public charge\" \u2013 individuals who depend on welfare programs \u2013 despite a 100-year-old law that is supposed to prevent this.\n\nThe department, citing \"data entry quality,\" reported that it did not have complete information on how many immigrants became public charges. However, the department did conduct a case-by-case review for the bulk of fiscal 2012, and found just one case where this claim was leveled at an immigrant. \"However, the charge was later withdrawn,\" DHS reported.\n\nFurther, the department reported that just a tiny fraction of people are rejected on these grounds when seeking entry under a program that allows admission for 90 days for travelers from certain countries. Between fiscal 2005 and most of fiscal 2012, a total of 9,796 were denied \u2013 a fraction of a percent of those admitted. State Department figures for visa applications showed a similar trend, with just.068 percent of visa applications denied on those grounds in fiscal 2011.\n\nSessions has been vocal about this issue for months. He and other Republican senators earlier wrote to the departments of Homeland Security and State arguing that a bedrock principle of immigration law is that \"those who seek citizenship in this country ought to be financially self-sufficient.\"\n\nThe senator suggests the immigration system has produced a lopsided result in which high-skill immigrants are turned away while those who end up absorbing more taxpayer dollars than they contribute stay. Recent studies show welfare spending on immigrant-headed households is relatively high. A Center for Immigration Studies report found that 36 percent of these households were using \"at least one major welfare program\" in 2010 \u2013 compared with 23 percent of other households.\n\nSessions' office states that the number of non-citizens on food stamps has skyrocketed in recent years. The conservative Heritage Foundation claims low-skill immigrant households take in roughly $20,000 more in government benefits every year than they pay in taxes.\n\nSessions suggests the government is fueling this trend. He earlier made a fuss over long-running U.S. Department of Agriculture radio \"novelas\" that depicted people being pressured into going on food stamps. The ads were later discontinued. The senator also is drawing attention to the WelcomeToUSA.gov site that provides information on a host of taxpayer assistance programs for immigrants, including Medicare, food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and others.",
    " Title: U.S. Lifts Sanctions on Three Russian Companies, Oligarch Oleg Deripaska Remains Under Restrictions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department announced on Wednesday that it will remove sanctions on three Russian companies, including aluminum giant United Co. Rusal PLC, EN+ Group PLC, and JSC EuroSibEnergo, which were previously on the U.S. sanctions list due to their ownership or control by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.\n\nThe Treasury Department stated that the companies agreed to a comprehensive deal that will result in their removal from the blacklist in 30 days. The deal is based on a change in factual circumstances, in line with longstanding U.S. sanctions precedent, and is not intended to significantly alter U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThe U.S. also imposed fresh sanctions on 15 Russian agents, including a former Russian intelligence officer who is reported to work for Mr. Deripaska and lead business negotiations on his behalf. The Treasury had issued licenses at least six times since April, allowing the companies to continue operating while they worked with the U.S. government to reach a satisfactory divestment plan.\n\nThe agreement requires Mr. Deripaska to reduce his ownership stake in EN+ from 70% to 44.95%, and he is prohibited from increasing his stake. Mr. Deripaska will not receive cash for his shares nor future dividends issued by the companies. EN+ is the linchpin underlying the sanctions designations on all three companies, as Mr. Deripaska has virtually no direct ownership in Rusal and none at all in EuroSibEnergo.\n\nThe agreement also mandates sweeping governance changes. Mr. Deripaska's voting rights in EN+ will be limited, and EN+ will create a 12-person board mostly independent of him. He will be bound to commitments severing his ability to control the company. In addition, EN+ and Rusal agreed to a number of transparency measures, including the provision of quarterly earnings reports, board minutes, and notifications of any change in board composition.\n\nEN+ will continue to control Rusal through a 56.88% stake, and it will retain the right to nominate the chief executive. EN+ also will use that majority control to create a 14-person board, most of whom will have no ties to Mr. Deripaska. Rusal's current chairman will step down, and the new chair will be held by one of the new directors. EuroSibEnergo, which is wholly owned by EN+, will provide the Treasury with monthly certifications that they are not acting on behalf of Mr. Deripaska.\n\nThe companies will face severe consequences if they fail to comply with the agreement, including being put back on the sanctions list. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that \"OFAC maintains the ability under the terms of the agreement to have unprecedented levels of transparency into operations.\"\n\nDavid Murray, a vice president at consulting firm Financial Integrity Network who previously served as the director of Treasury's illicit finance office, commented that \"What we have is an outline of expectations that OFAC may have for other companies targeted solely because they're owned or controlled by someone on the sanctions list.\"\n\nAluminum prices, which fell to a 16-month low before the sanctions announcement, could head lower once the sanctions are lifted. Some analysts had predicted aluminum prices would rise again in 2019, based in part on the sanctions against Rusal, the world's second-largest aluminum producer. \"If (the sanctions) had not been solved, at least half of Rusal's production would have had to shut down,\" said Lloyd O' Carroll, an independent analyst for the metals industry. \"That's not happening now.\"",
    " Title: Town Hall Debate: A Balancing Act for Obama and Romney as They Emulate Clinton's 1992 Performance\n\nArticle:\n\nThe town hall-style debate, popularized by Bill Clinton in 1992, is set to return on Tuesday, with President Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney taking the stage. However, the format presents a unique challenge for President Obama, who is expected to display more passion and engage more directly with the audience, according to political analysts.\n\nChris Arterton, a professor of political management at George Washington University, notes that Democratic partisans are eager to see a more passionate performance from President Obama, but the town hall format may not be the ideal platform for him to display this passion while also taking on Romney in a more confrontational manner.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Obama, given his performance in the first debate, has to do two things simultaneously \u2014 take on Romney in a more confrontational way and at the same time, be responsive to the person asking the question,\" Arterton says. \"That's not easy.\"\n\nAlan Schroeder, a journalism professor at Northeastern University, agrees that the town hall format will require a balancing act from the president. \"The town hall format is more conversational. There's more of a dialogue with people asking the questions,\" Schroeder says.\n\nCandidates at debates are known for dodging questions and delivering rehearsed political soliloquies. However, in a town hall, ignoring a question from a working mother of two from Red Hook, for example, would not be an option.\n\n\"In a town hall, I think one of the measurements is whether the candidate is responsive to the question,\" Schroeder says. \"There are also some physical things. Being able to maneuver the space, understanding that it's a different-looking debate than the ones where you either sit at a table or stand at lecterns.\"\n\nBill Clinton's performance in the 1992 town hall debate is often cited as a model for how to engage with the audience. \"He got off his chair; he engaged more than President Bush did. He walked around more freely, was more responsive, more natural,\" Arterton says.\n\nHowever, the town hall debate format has become more controlled in recent years, with campaigns placing more restrictions on the questions asked. \"Now, you have to get there early, write up your question on a piece of paper, the moderator chooses the question, the questioner is not allowed to depart from what they have written, they are not allowed to follow up,\" Schroeder says.\n\nThe result? The 2008 town hall debate between Obama and GOP nominee Sen. John McCain was \"one of the dullest presidential debates in history,\" Schroeder says. \"The campaigns don't like spontaneity,\" he says. \"They want to be able to predict the questions, and if they are vetted by the moderator first, there's a better chance of doing so.\"\n\nThe tussle over control of the format is ongoing, with CNN anchor Candy Crowley, who will moderate the debate, raising hackles on both sides for suggesting that she may take a more active role in the questioning. As strange as it sounds after his lackluster performance in Denver, one last hurdle for President Obama might be changing his tactics while still giving off an aura of consistency. In 2000, Vice President Al Gore changed his style from debate to debate, Arterton notes. \"First he was Attila the Hun, then Mr. Nice Guy and in the last debate, he was the geeky policy wonk,\" he says. \"People just couldn't get a fix on who he was.\"",
    " Title: Tucker Carlson Addresses Growing Political Tensions in New Book: \"Ship of Fools\"\n\nIn a recent interview, Fox News host Tucker Carlson discussed the increasing political polarization in the United States, citing instances of confrontational protests and the role of the mainstream media in shaping public opinion.\n\nThe latest example of such confrontations occurred last Friday, when a protester confronted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, at a restaurant in Kentucky. The protester reportedly told them to \"get out of here\" and \"leave the entire country.\" The protesters followed McConnell to his car and threw his to-go box out the door.\n\nCarlson, in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, accused the mainstream media of being \"water carriers for the Democratic Party.\" He argued that the media's presentation of news is a reflection of the Democratic Party's political objectives for the day.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's latest tagline, \"jobs not mobs,\" suggests that the Democratic Party has become the party of mob rule, an idea that Carlson agrees with. He stated, \"The Democratic Party obviously is not in control of its crazy people on the street, okay. Those people are committing acts of violence. They do not want to admit that because they know it scares normal people.\"\n\nWhen asked about the alleged violence on the political Right, Carlson responded, \"That's not true.\" He acknowledged the existence of extremists on all sides but argued that there are currently no groups of conservatives engaging in the same level of disruptive behavior as some on the Left, such as shouting at lawmakers in restaurants, on airplanes, or in airports, or damaging property.\n\nCarlson's views on the country's heated politics are further explored in his new book, \"Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution.\" The book is set to provide insights into the current state of American politics and the potential consequences of the country's polarization.",
    " Title: GOP Unveils Detailed Draft of Obamacare Replacement Plan: A Comprehensive Look at the Proposed Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Republican party has released a detailed draft proposal for the long-awaited Obamacare replacement plan. The document, while not a finalized piece of legislation, offers a comprehensive and specific glimpse at the Republicans' approach to overhaul the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nThe proposed bill, according to analysts, eliminates most of the onerous, market-distorting provisions contained within the ACA. It abolishes many of the subsidies that reduce the incentives for those outside the labor force to remain there, and it eliminates the individual mandate to purchase insurance.\n\nBased on age, not income, the plan would establish tax credits to help uninsured patients afford private insurance plans. The plan scales back or eliminates some of ObamaCare\u2019s most burdensome tax provisions, including the Medicare surtax on wages and self-employment income. It eliminates federal Medicaid expansion by 2020, but preserves capped payments to states based on the number of enrollees in states that expanded Medicaid already.\n\nMost encouragingly, the plan includes grants to states that would allow them to experiment with programs designed to increase coverage rates or reduce premiums.\n\nHowever, the plan also includes elements that appear to partially mimic or tweak Obamacare's existing provisions. Conservative healthcare wonk Avik Roy offers a mixed verdict on the roadmap laid out in the leaked document. He notes that Republicans have abandoned the flawed \"repeal and delay\" strategy, which would have rolled back large swathes of Obamacare via reconciliation, then punted the replacement piece to an undetermined later date.\n\nThe new law would still prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, so long as those people have maintained continuous coverage. This strongly incentivizes consumers to obtain coverage without imposing an individual mandate tax (which is repealed under this plan) and while disincentivizing people to wait until they develop a health problem or injury before finally enrolling (by permitting insurers to charge substantially more to people who seek to sign up after a coverage gap).\n\nThe proposal also entails critical reforms to Medicaid (through a form of flexible block-granting) and Health Savings Accounts (roughly doubling the amount of money individuals and families can save for medical expenses tax-free). It also pumps billions into a modernized version of high-risk pools, under which states can innovate and invest to help cover the medical expenses of their most vulnerable citizens.\n\nOverall, there are disputes and details that will undoubtedly still need to be ironed out. That's what debates, negotiations, and legislative mark-ups are for. I'd be quite surprised if the eventual legislative language were identical to the draft document, which is a useful and important starting point.\n\nMeanwhile, knee-jerk accusations from some conservatives that the plan amounts to \"Obamacare lite\" are unfair; the core of the troubled law is removed, and replaced with a system that massively curtails burdensome federal mandates and taxes, and offers much more flexibility and discretion to the states. These changes, if adopted, would represent a welcome paradigm shift.\n\nThat said, it's not as if federal spending, mandates, and revenue-raisers will all magically disappear. Helping tens of millions of people have access to affordable coverage is a complex policy challenge. Republicans' draft proposal seeks to end the current law, then provide needed solutions in a less intrusive and market-distorting way than the current sputtering reality under Democrats' failed scheme.\n\nFinally, with media chatter about town hall meetings on healthcare all the rage these days (with appalling displays like this receiving scant attention), I'll leave you with a few points: (1) Conservatives should go out of their way to attend these events and make phone calls to their members' offices in order to help stiffen GOP spines in the face of intense, and sometimes coordinated, liberal opposition. (2) Republicans ought to be prepared to defend their positions with compassion and confidence, as quite a few have been doing. (3) Beware of fake news stories about members \"skipping\" or \"fleeing\" town hall meetings that they'd never organized or committed to in the first place. (4) How's this for a narrative disruptor?\n\nNEWS: From MT to WV, the nation's most vulnerable Senate Dems are avoiding town hall meetings - ABC News - via @ ABC.",
    " Title: Young People Favor Same-sex Marriage, but the Future of Marriage Remains a Question: David Frum\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in societal attitudes, young people overwhelmingly support same-sex marriage, according to political commentator David Frum. However, Frum poses a more pressing question: the future of marriage in general. Frum, a renowned author and senior editor at The Atlantic, points out that children born to single parents face much longer odds in life, and this issue may be more critical than the ongoing debate about same-sex marriage.\n\nThis week, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in two same-sex marriage cases. Regardless of the court's decision, the outcome seems predetermined, Frum suggests, given that 80% of Americans under 30 support same-sex marriage. However, while young straight Americans support marriage for gays, they are increasingly opting against marriage for themselves.\n\nThe trend is alarming, with nearly half of American children, 48%, now born to unmarried women. Among women without college degrees, and of all races, unwed motherhood has become the norm. This, Frum argues, is the crisis of the American family.\n\nThe consequences of single parenthood are far-reaching. Children born to married mothers and fathers are more likely to finish college, avoid prison, and form marriages themselves than children born to single parents. The harms of single parenthood tend to be self-replicating, threatening to create a caste divide, with some families launched into cycles of downward mobility due to the unstable relationships of parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents.\n\nThe debate over same-sex marriage has dominated headlines for the past two decades, while the issue of single parenthood has been largely overlooked. One reason for this, Frum suggests, is the lack of good ideas about how to address the problem. The core of the problem seems to be the decline of male wages relative to female wages.\n\nIn a recent New York Times article, MIT economist Michael Greenstone stated, \"I think the greatest, most astonishing fact that I am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out 'You need more education' and have been able to respond to that, and men have not. And it's very, very scary for economists because people should be responding to price signals. And men are not.\"\n\nThe decline of mass-production industries has put pressure on the roles and incomes of working-class and middle-class men. The expansion of government and service industries has opened new opportunities for women, of which working-class and middle-class men seem less able to avail themselves.\n\nIt's crucial to note that men in full-time work continue to earn more than women in full-time work. However, the bottom-line number conceals a widening divergence between the family patterns of the college-educated top one-third and those of the non-college-educated bottom two-thirds. The family life of the bottom two-thirds is the family policy challenge of the 21st century, Frum asserts. The debate over same-sex marriage is yesterday's issue; it's settled, whether the Supreme Court knows it or not. But how to ensure that the next generation of American children enjoys the more equal chance and the wider opportunities from a more universal commitment to marriage\u2014that debate needs to begin.",
    " Title: Romney's Wife Hints at Consideration of Female Vice Presidential Candidate, Discusses Campaign Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare joint interview with CBS News, Ann Romney, wife of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, revealed that her husband is considering a female running mate for the upcoming election. The interview, conducted at the Romney family's lakeside estate in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, also provided insights into the Romneys' strategy and the ongoing vice presidential search.\n\nDuring the interview, Ann Romney stated, \"We've been looking at that, and I love that option as well.\" She added, \"There's a lot of people that Mitt is considering right now.\" When asked about President Obama's strategy, Ann Romney said, \"Early on, we heard what their strategy was. It was 'kill Romney.' Not when I'm next to him, you better not.\"\n\nMitt Romney himself did not comment on his wife's characterization of President Obama's strategy during the joint interview. He also declined to discuss the status of the vice presidential search, stating, \"That's something I'm keeping close with my team.\"\n\nSpeculation about the potential vice presidential candidate has been high, with names such as Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman being mentioned.\n\nAnn Romney also outlined her requirements for a running mate, stating, \"Someone that obviously can do the job but will be able to carry through with some of the other responsibilities.\" She added, \"Competent, capable, and willing to serve this country. I think there's lots of good people out there that fill that bill right now.\"\n\nThe last time a woman was on a Republican presidential ticket was in 2008 when Sen. John McCain selected then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a move that was criticized for her lack of readiness to be president. This year, Mitt Romney has emphasized preparedness to be president as his top requirement for a vice president.\n\nThe Romneys' interview comes at a crucial time in the campaign, with the Republican National Convention scheduled for late August. The Romneys are taking a week-long break at their New Hampshire estate, a chance for the candidate to contemplate strategy and adjust as necessary in a contest that polls show is close.\n\nSeveral potential candidates, including Sen.

    " Title: Understanding the Causes of Mass Incarceration in America: A Look at the National Research Council Report\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is witnessing a growing movement towards reducing mass incarceration, with both the federal government and state governments scrutinizing the number of individuals they are sending to prison and the lengths of their sentences. However, the question remains: how did the U.S. prison population grow so significantly over the past 40 years?\n\nA National Research Council report from 2014 debunked two common misconceptions about the causes of the increase, offering two primary reasons: increased efficiency in prosecution and lengthened prison sentences.\n\nThe report found that the rise in incarceration could not be attributed to crime rates increasing. Crime rates have varied over the past forty years, and do not seem to have a substantial impact on the prison population, regardless of the direction of crime rates. The report also found no evidence that harsher prison sentences deter crime.\n\nIt was not because of better policing leading to more arrests\nPolicing has evolved significantly since the beginning of the mass-incarceration era, and most of these changes have been designed to make policing more effective. This implies that police are better at apprehending criminals today than they were thirty years ago.\n\nHowever, the NRC report showed that since 1980, the ratio of arrests per crime\u2014in other words, the proportion of crimes that police were able to find and arrest suspects for\u2014stayed relatively constant. Based on the arrest-to-crime ratio, the authors wrote, \"no increase in policing effectiveness occurred from 1980 to 2010 that might explain higher rates of incarceration.\"\n\nIt was because people who got arrested were more likely to go to jail\nWhile the arrest-to-crime ratio is a rough measure of police effectiveness, the prison-to-arrest ratio is a rough measure of the efficiency of the prosecution and court process. The NRC report found that prosecution has become more efficient, and this was a significant reason for the explosion of the incarcerated population.\n\nWhy are people who get arrested more likely to end up in prison now than they were thirty years ago? Part of it is that more crimes now require a prison sentence than required one in 1980, so more of the people who are found guilty of crimes end up having to go to prison for them (rather than getting probation or a fine).\n\nPart of it is also that most people who get convicted of crimes these days never even go to trial\u2014they just plead guilty in exchange for a shorter prison sentence. This makes it much easier for prosecutors to move cases through the courts. Of course, efficiency is not necessarily the same as effectiveness\u2014in theory, the point of prosecution should be to determine whether the person committed a crime or not, not to convict and sentence as many people as possible.\n\nBut whatever the merits of the way prosecution works, the authors concluded it was definitely a big reason for the rise of mass incarceration. In fact, during the 1980s, it was the biggest reason, before being overtaken by the last and most important factor.\n\nIt was because people who went to prison served more time\nThe biggest reason the prison population exploded, especially after 1990: more people were in prison for longer periods of time. This is also largely due to changes in sentencing policy. States and the federal government added lots of new mandatory minimum sentences in the 1980s and 1990s, which forced people convicted of a given crime to serve a certain number of years in jail.\n\nOne particularly harsh kind of mandatory minimum sentence was imposed as \"three-strikes\" laws, which forced a criminal convicted of his third felony to serve a long prison sentence (between 25 years and a life sentence). States and the federal government also passed \"truth-in-sentencing\" laws, particularly in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which forced inmates to serve a large amount of their prison sentences (typically 85 percent) before being eligible for parole.\n\nUltimately, the NRC report's authors said, the common denominator in both of the big causes of mass incarceration\u2014more prisoners per arrest, and longer sentences per prisoner\u2014is the harsher sentencing policies of the 1980s and 1990s. That means that sentencing reform policies that some state governments have been pursuing, and that members of Congress in both parties have proposed, are a good place to start when it comes to reducing mass incarceration\u2014even if they are not a panacea.",
    " Title: Politicians Distance Themselves from Controversial Remarks Made by Cliven Bundy, Ted Nugent, and Phil Robertson\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy's racially charged comments about the welfare of African Americans under slavery, several prominent politicians have distanced themselves from the controversy. Bundy's remarks, which have been widely criticized as offensive and insensitive, are the latest in a series of incendiary racial comments from a new crop of folk heroes embraced in some conservative circles.\n\nBundy, 67, a rancher whose much-publicized land dispute with the federal government endeared him to conservatives, defended his comments as idle thoughts. \"In my mind I'm wondering, are they better off being slaves, in that sense, or better off being slaves to the United States government, in the sense of the subsidies? I'm wondering. That's what. And the statement was right. I am wondering,\" he said Thursday on \"The Peter Schiff Show.\"\n\nHowever, Bundy stood by those comments in interviews with CNN on Thursday and Friday. In a tense exchange with \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo on Friday morning, Bundy said, \"Maybe I sinned... If I say Negro or black or slave... if those people can not take those kind of words and not be (offended), then Martin Luther King has not got his job done yet... We need to get over this prejudice stuff.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a potential 2016 presidential GOP contender, Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, and other conservatives have scrambled to distance themselves from the controversy. \"His remarks on race are offensive and I wholeheartedly disagree with him,\" Paul said in a statement. Heller \"completely disagrees with Mr. Bundy's appalling and racist statements, and condemns them in the most strenuous way,\" according to his spokesman, Chandler Smith.\n\nThe Republican National Committee said Bundy's comments were \"completely beyond the pale. Both highly offensive and 100% wrong on race.\"\n\nExperts on race and politics say the comments, much like those of rocker Ted Nugent, who created a firestorm when he called President Barack Obama a \"subhuman mongrel,\" also speak to complicated and deeply fraught cultural tensions running beneath the surface in some segments of America.\n\n\"We are looking at some of the 'last white men standing,'\" said Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University, referring to demographic shifts that show minorities now represent more than half of the nation's population born in 2010 and 2011, according to the most recent census data.\n\n\"His comments represent that, and people rally around him because of this idea that white men are under siege. They are calling out the political establishment to stand by them,\" Neal said.\n\nOver the next several generations, political experts say minority voters will become more of a power base in the Deep South, the Southwest, and in California. During the 2012 presidential election, Republicans faced huge losses among minorities and women, prompting the GOP to re-examine outreach to those groups.\n\nBundy's comments, much like those of Nugent and \"Duck Dynasty\" star Phil Robertson, who shared during an interview with GQ last year pastoral recollections of blacks \"singing and happy\" as he and his family worked alongside them in Louisiana cotton fields, speak to a certain politically active fringe element, political experts say.\n\n\"What this reflects is that there are groups of people who have not been accepted by politically correct circles and have never learned to frame their comments in a palatable fashion. They take pride in that,\" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. \"The articulation of their views is somewhat fringe, but the underlying attitude is not. They are a minority viewpoint, but they are a large minority.\"\n\nPoliticians who have previously embraced men such as Bundy, Nugent, and Robertson as cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bres are now finding themselves in an awkward position. For instance, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, his state's Republican nominee for governor, took heat from some quarters when Nugent appeared at a campaign event for him this year. Abbott's campaign said it did not endorse Nugent's comments.\n\nOther Republicans viewed as potential presidential candidates, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and the state's governor, Rick Perry, also distanced themselves from Nugent's remarks. Paul said an apology was in order, which Nugent eventually offered for using the term.\n\nConservative radio host Sean Hannity said on his show that he worries Democrats will now use Bundy's \"repugnant\" and \"despicable\" comments to paint everyone on the far right as racists. \"If you ever want to be taken seriously for your outreach efforts, you might want to start by not defending racists,\" DNC spokesman Mo Elleithee said in a statement.",
    " Title: White House Invokes Executive Privilege in Fast and Furious Documents Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing dispute between the Obama administration and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee over the Fast and Furious operation has escalated, with reports indicating that the White House is invoking executive privilege over documents that the committee's Republican majority has subpoenaed. This development comes just before a committee hearing, where lawmakers are expected to vote on whether to cite Attorney General Eric Holder for contempt of Congress for failing to comply with the subpoena.\n\nThe hearing, which is to be webcast, is set to take place amidst the news of the executive privilege assertion. According to NPR's Carrie Johnson and others, the committee is expected to proceed with the majority's plan to cite Holder for contempt.\n\nFast and Furious gained public attention following the December 2010 death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry. Two guns linked to the flawed gun-trafficking operation were found near Terry's body, sparking two congressional probes and an ongoing investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general.\n\nDuring a hearing on June 7, Holder faced tough questioning from Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) and other Republican lawmakers. Issa asked Holder if his department was aware of the tactics used in the gunrunning operation, and Republicans accused him of not being forthcoming and not complying with subpoenas.\n\nAs of now, the committee has not yet voted on the contempt citation. Members are still arguing along partisan lines, with Republicans advocating for and Democrats opposing the contempt citation of Holder.\n\nIf the committee does vote to hold Holder in contempt, the contempt citation would then go to the full House. The Associated Press reports that if the matter progresses, there could be a federal case against Holder, but past examples suggest the matter may not reach that point.\n\nThe lawmakers are still deliberating, and no vote has been cast as of yet. Committee members are still giving their opening statements, with arguments along party lines\u2014Republicans stating that the Obama administration has been resisting efforts to obtain information about Fast and Furious, while Democrats argue that the administration has cooperated fully.\n\nAt the start of the hearing, Issa stated that the committee did not aim to hold Holder in contempt, but rather to \"get the information the committee needs to complete its work.\" He described the assertion of executive privilege as \"untimely\" and \"not spoken of last night\" during negotiations between committee staffers and Justice Department officials.",
    " Title: Montana Special Election: Republican Greg Gianforte Wins Amid Assault Allegation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closely-watched race, Republican Greg Gianforte has emerged victorious in the Montana special congressional election, defeating Democrat Rob Quist despite an election-eve altercation with a journalist that led to a misdemeanor assault charge.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, with 83 percent of precincts counted, Mr. Gianforte led Mr. Quist by a margin of 50.3 percent to 43.9 percent. Libertarian Mark Wicks secured 5.8 percent of the vote.\n\nThe race was called in Mr. Gianforte's favor more than 2\u00bd hours after polls closed at 8 p.m. MDT. The victory comes less than 24 hours after Mr. Gianforte was charged with misdemeanor assault following an incident involving a reporter from Britain's Guardian newspaper.\n\nIn his election night speech, Mr. Gianforte expressed gratitude to Montana voters, stating, \"Tonight, Montanans are sending a wake-up call to the Washington DC establishment.\" He also addressed the incident with reporter Ben Jacobs, saying, \"I made a mistake and I took an action that I can't take back.\"\n\nThe outcome of the election means that Republicans will now hold a 239-193 majority in the House. The victory, however, could potentially cause headaches for GOP lawmakers, who have faced questions over their stance on Mr. Gianforte's behavior and his potential inclusion in the GOP conference.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have both expressed disapproval of Mr. Gianforte's actions, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described him as a \"wannabe Trump\" and called for a \"higher standard of behavior.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, Mr. Gianforte's victory marks the continued success of Republicans in special congressional races following the election of President Trump. The Democrats, on the other hand, are now 0 for 2 in special election races, having also lost the April special election in the 5th Congressional District in Kansas.\n\nLooking ahead, both parties will now focus on the June 20 special election in Georgia's 6th Congressional District, where Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel are in a tight race.",
    " Title: The Importance of Political Dialogue at the Thanksgiving Table: A Call for Conservative Families to Engage with Progressive Relatives\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, many Americans are reminded of the unspoken rule to avoid political discussions during family gatherings, especially during Thanksgiving. However, this year, some conservative media outlets are urging families to seize the opportunity to engage in political dialogue with their progressive relatives, particularly those who have moved to coastal cities or are attending college.\n\nFor conservative families, Thanksgiving may be the only time to speak to their progressive relatives with a home-field advantage, outside of their liberal bubble. This term, \"bubble,\" is not used in hyperbole but represents the closed-off mindset of American progressivism in coastal cities and on college campuses.\n\nIn cities like New York, where the labor movement is seen as too centrist, and avowed Socialists are now a \"political force,\" do conservative family members ever get to hear both sides? Of course not. On the coasts, far-flung progressive interest groups are now directing policy, and rational thought and political balance are principles relegated to the occasional op-ed.\n\nOn campus, conservative relatives may be in much more dire straits, having their minds shaped in the midst of the unparalleled and unmitigated rage of the American left, where \"cancel culture\" and groupthink overshadows academic debate. That's a $41,000 bill for a degree in close-minded wokeness you're paying for, mom and dad.\n\nFellow conservative, if you are concerned by this, and by the broader rise of the radical left, then by-God you must use this holiday for more than just gorging on Karen's apple cobbler. You have your son, daughter, niece, or nephew on your home turf, where they can't be blinded: the family table. Make use of it!\n\nDo not hesitate to retell the story of why you live where you live, especially if you're one of millions of American families who have fled the high-taxed states for other parts of the country. Explain how this has bettered their lives.\n\nRemind them about religion, and how religious institutions have been a positive force for change in our country since its inception. Perhaps they enjoyed playing for the St. Ignatius basketball team, or how mom relied on the J.C.C. afterschool program so she could work. Has their family benefitted from a religious organization?\n\nLet them wow you with their talk of Socialism. Then confront them with the stark reality of why it scares you. Has a family member ever experienced it firsthand, or at least seen on television the devolution and poverty of the Soviet Union and other countries over the years?\n\nBe open about your family's past. Whether it immigrated like mine 100 years ago from the sulfur mines of Sicily to the subway tunnels of New York, or whether yours came like so many just years ago with nothing but the hope and promise of hard work, explain how your family made sacrifices and took risks.\n\nPerhaps even recall how your household was once Democratic, and how membership in a union played a role in their success. But unmask the modern party and how they have abandoned the middle class for the fringe-left.\n\nTalk about the law enforcement. Do they feel the same anti-police anger as many in their generation? Do they not recall the family members who wore a badge, or the friends they grew up with who became cops? Are those people really racists, or fascists, or whatever they tend to call them?\n\nDo not hesitate to bring up Trump. Sure, they may hate him, but explain why your family may be better off. Explain what more money in the family bank account does for them, personally. Explain what the booming economy and job market has done for the hometown and the neighbors they once loved. Remind them how the retirement fund looks, and how there will be more for them some day in the future.\n\nPrepare for some hurt feelings and rolling-eyes by the time the pumpkin pie is served. But on balance, we all must realize that these opportunities to confront those in our family who form the vanguard of the American left are few and far in between. If we don't want to end up eating meatless turkey at some Thanksgiving in the future, now may be the time to serve up a hot plate of reality.",
    " Title: Newsrooms Adapt to Trump Presidency: A New Era of Unpredictability and Excitement\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the reality of a Donald Trump presidency sets in, the media landscape is undergoing a significant shift. The unpredictable and controversial nature of the president-elect has revitalized newsrooms, offering a plethora of storylines and changes that were not anticipated.\n\n\"This changes everything,\" says Phil Griffin, president of MSNBC. \"We left the studio at 4 a.m., and we knew there was a whole other world of storylines and changes that are going to happen.\"\n\nMajor TV news operations were bracing for a ratings decline as the historic and contentious election wound down. CNN had its highest online traffic ever on Election Day, and the election was a distinct revenue driver for its parent company, Time Warner, this year. However, the company was warning as early as summer that its ratings would drop next year.\n\nBut Tuesday happened. Trump defied most polls and emerged victorious, leaving TV networks to quickly reconsider coverage plans and story ideas. \"There are so many different threads that we'll pursue that we didn't imagine three days ago,\" Griffin says. \"It's an amazing story about what's going on in this country.\"\n\nThe first 100 days of any presidency are exciting, particularly when a new party takes over in Washington, D.C. The transition, with politicians jockeying for key Cabinet positions, is a horse race of its own kind. But, Trump, the inexperienced politician suddenly leading the federal government, adds multiple and substantive layers to the story.\n\n\"You've got a more dynamic transition in place,\" says Chris Isham, CBS News' Washington bureau chief. \"He's not a predictable Republican, not in the way of previous administrations.\"\n\nGauging Trump's comfort level with the press, already underway, has been as challenging as pinning down his stance on issues. Reporters who have known him for years speak of his accessibility and willingness to banter. Yet he's also sought political advantage in bashing the mainstream media.\n\n\"Let's see how much access he grants,\" Ariens said. \"He's not the candidate anymore. He's not going to be calling into Fox and Friends.\"\n\nOne of the first major interviews Trump granted after the election was to 60 Minutes, which will air Sunday. Jeff Fager, executive producer of 60 Minutes, said the show had planned on pursuing an interview with the president-elect regardless of the election outcome, but because so much of Trump's governing philosophy and policy specifics are unknown, it heightens the urgency.\n\n\"It's not about good TV. It's about how we can help people better understand,\" Fager says. \"There's a lot to talk about. Hopefully, we'll get some details.\"\n\nIn an interview clip released early by CBS, Trump says he's willing to retain some key provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThere has already been plenty of hand-wringing in American newsrooms about the failure to properly assess the impact of Trump's voters and the issues that drove them so eagerly to the voting booths. Coverage planning for Trump's presidency must entail deep-diving into these issues to hold him accountable for some of his outlandish proposals, Fager says.\n\n\"There are so many layers that make this interesting,\" he says. \"He's tapped into the dissatisfied voters. That's an important part of this. How is he going to address the issues they care about? How is he going to build a wall?\"\n\nBeyond issues, scrutinizing Trump's governing styles and tendencies\u2014not as a career politician, but honed on the fly based on his experience as a real estate developer and TV personality\u2014will also be a rich source of stories.\n\n\"He's a businessman who's a negotiator,\" Fager says. \"There's a lot of stories that could be generated in (covering) someone who's got a totally different perspective on how to get things done.\"\n\nWhile no news executives may admit it publicly, the possibility of Trump's gaffes and unfiltered diatribes, frequently evident during his campaign, remains an intriguing variable, says Mark Feldstein, a broadcast journalism professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, and a former journalist at NBC.\n\n\"Media critics are always attacking TV for ideological bias,\" he says. \"But the real bias is toward conflict, controversy, and excitement because that's what increases revenue. Whether you love or hate him, he is going to bring controversy.\"",
    " Title: Trump Softens Stance on Immigration, Courts Non-White Vote Amidst Controversial Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in his campaign strategy, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has softened his stance on the contentious issue of immigration, as he seeks to appeal to non-white voters. This move comes amidst a series of controversial statements made by the candidate this week, which have sparked debate and criticism.\n\nThe week began with Trump's interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, where he stated, \"They'll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes. There's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we will work with them.\" This statement appears to indicate a departure from his previous hardline stance on immigration, which included the proposal for a \"great, great wall\" along the US-Mexico border and the suggestion of a \"deportation force\" to remove undocumented migrants.\n\nHowever, the following day, after meeting with his Hispanic advisory council, reports emerged that Trump was softening his stance. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, seemed to waffle on whether Trump was still committed to deportation. In response, Trump denied that he was \"flip-flopping\" and postponed a speech he was due to give on Thursday to fine-tune his immigration policy.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump clarified that immigrants not in the US legally would not be granted citizenship but seemed to offer a path forward, contradicting his previous promises of deportation. This apparent moderation on immigration comes as Trump tries to aggressively court Hispanic and African American voters, trailing behind Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in polls.\n\nIn a speech in Akron, Ohio, on August 22, Trump made a series of statements about crime in American cities, particularly those run by the Democrats. He claimed that crime is at \"levels that nobody's seen\" and that crime-ridden American streets are more dangerous than parts of the world where the US is engaged in military action. However, this statement contradicts a trend of declining crime that has persisted for over a quarter of a century.\n\nTrump also claimed to employ \"so many, so many\" African Americans in his various businesses. However, a June analysis by the Associated Press found \"few if any\" black executives in the upper echelon of Trump's organization. Trump has recently increased his outreach to African American voters, but he delivers his speeches before largely white audiences. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed Trump receiving the support of only 1% of African American voters.\n\nIn a speech in Dimondale, Michigan, on August 19, Trump repeated the eye-popping statistic that more than half of young black men and women are unemployed. However, the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics put the unemployment rate among 16- to 19-year-old black Americans at 25.7%. The campaign's economic adviser, David Malpass, explained that the 58% figure was calculated by including labor force participants and those outside the labor force, such as students and retirees, in the calculation. Economists have criticized this method as statistically misleading.\n\nIn conclusion, Donald Trump's recent statements and actions suggest a softening of his stance on immigration and a renewed effort to court non-white voters. However, his statements on crime and employment among African Americans have been met with criticism and controversy, raising questions about the accuracy and tact of his approach.",
    " Title: Biden's Third Presidential Bid: A Unity Candidate in Question\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2020 presidential race heats up, former Vice President Joe Biden is gearing up for his third run for the highest office in the land, having previously contested in 1988 and 2008. Currently, Biden leads in 36 out of 37 polls compiled by RealClearPolitics, and is ahead in Iowa and even in Kamala Harris' home state of California.\n\nHowever, Biden's campaign is facing a significant challenge: the question of his ability to unite the Democratic Party, a role he was once seen as a frontrunner for due to his long party service and his association with the popular Barack Obama administration. Recent months have seen a resurgence of criticism over Biden's past political and policy associations, particularly those that are not well-regarded by the party's minority and feminist constituencies.\n\nDespite this, Biden's standing among Democratic voters remains strong. Morning Consult's tracking poll of Democrats shows him with a high approval rating of 75/15. He is also the top second-choice candidate for those who favor Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, or Bernie Sanders.\n\nHowever, as the primary season approaches, it remains to be seen whether Biden can maintain his \"unity candidate\" persona, particularly if his rivals begin to attack him more forcefully. Some political analysts have raised concerns that Biden's past record could become a significant issue for actual voters, and that he may struggle to balance his moderate past with the party's more progressive leanings.\n\nOne potential solution for Biden is to establish himself as the most, or even the only, electable candidate against President Donald Trump. Some argue that Biden has a unique ability to appeal to white working-class swing voters in the Rust Belt states that were crucial to both Obama's and Hillary Clinton's victories. However, it is still early in the election cycle, and it remains to be seen whether this will prove to be a significant factor in the general election.",
    " Title: Volker Testimony Undercuts Biden Allegations in Trump Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, Republican lawmakers are increasingly relying on the closed-door testimony of senior diplomat Kurt Volker to defend Trump against allegations of improper dealings. Volker, a close ally of Trump, has provided a version of events that suggests Trump did not engage in a \"quid pro quo\" when he pressured Ukraine's new president to investigate allegations against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) stated on Wednesday that \"The definitive account on all of this is the one from Ambassador Volker.\" Around the same time, Trump tweeted a \"thank you\" to Volker for his testimony. A transcript of Volker's testimony, released by the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, has been a topic of discussion.\n\nHowever, Volker's account contradicts the specific allegations against Biden that Trump and his allies have been promoting for months. In his testimony, Volker stated that no evidence was presented to support the allegations, and he considered them \"very self-serving and not credible.\"\n\nBiden has publicly admitted to pressuring Ukraine's leadership to fire prosecutor general Viktor Shokin in 2016, even threatening to withhold nearly $1 billion in U.S. aid if Shokin was not removed. Volker testified that Biden's actions were in line with U.S. policy at the time and were widely understood as the right policy.\n\nRepublicans have questioned Biden's son Hunter's involvement with Burisma, a major gas company in Ukraine, where he served on the board for two years. They have suggested that Burisma may have hired Biden's son to curry favor with the Obama administration or to protect themselves. Volker testified that it is \"quite possible\" that Burisma executives believed they were \"buying influence\" through Biden's son, but he did not believe Biden would take any improper action on his son's behalf.\n\nVolker's testimony also sheds light on Shokin's reputation, with Volker stating that Shokin was not pursuing corruption cases and had a \"notorious reputation\" for not doing his job. This contradicts the allegations made by Shokin's successor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who claimed that Biden pushed for Shokin's firing to protect his son and derail the Ukrainian investigation of Burisma.\n\nVolker testified that Lutsenko's allegations were self-serving and made up to save his job and prevent investigations into his own actions. Lutsenko's initial claims seemed to back away after Zelenskiy was elected as Ukraine's new president and after the allegations against Biden began to attract more media attention.\n\nIn conclusion, Volker's testimony undercuts the specific allegations against Biden that Trump and his allies have been promoting. The allegations against Biden have not been directly or fully debunked, according to Volker, as they have never been investigated. The impeachment inquiry against Trump continues, with the House Intelligence Committee expected to release more transcripts of closed-door testimony in the coming days.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Releases 658-Page Impeachment Report on President Trump\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has released a comprehensive 658-page report detailing the impeachment case against President Donald Trump, early Monday morning. The report alleges two impeachable offenses: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress during its investigation.\n\nThe report states, \"President Trump has placed his personal, political interests above our national security, our free and fair elections, and our systems of checks and balances.\" The Judiciary Committee argues that the President's actions constitute a pattern of misconduct that, if left unchecked, will continue. The report concludes, \"Accordingly, President Trump should be impeached and removed from office.\"\n\nThe Democrats also assert that Trump has committed crimes, although these are not explicitly outlined in the articles of impeachment. The report states, \"While there is no need for a crime to be proven in order for impeachment to be warranted, here, President Trump's scheme or course of conduct also encompassed other offenses, both constitutional and criminal in character.\"\n\nThe report alleges that Trump's abuse of power constituted the constitutional offense of \"Bribery\" and multiple federal crimes. The Democrats argue that Trump has betrayed the national interest, the people of the nation, and should not be allowed to be above the law.\n\nRepublicans, led by Ranking Member Doug Collins (R-GA), have criticized the Democrats for what they perceive as a biased impeachment process. Collins stated, \"The facts are contested, and, in many areas, the majority's claims are directly contradicted by the evidence.\" The Republicans argue that the Democrats have based their impeachment case on hearsay and assumptions, and that the articles of impeachment do not include any of the criminal accusations leveled against the President over the past year.\n\nThe Republicans also claim that the Democrats' impeachment process is \"unprecedented, unjustifiable, and will only dilute the significance of the dire recourse that is impeachment.\" The full House is expected to vote on the articles of impeachment this week.",
    " Title: Missing Wisconsin Girl Jayme Closs Found After 88 Days; Suspect Arrested for Kidnapping and Murder\n\nIn a significant development, 13-year-old Jayme Closs, who had been missing since her parents were found dead in their home three months ago, has been located. The girl was found on Thursday, having escaped from a remote house and was subsequently found by a woman walking her dog.\n\nJayme was taken into police custody after the woman, upon noticing her, stopped at a nearby home to call the authorities. The teenager was reunited with her family on Friday following discussions with investigators.\n\nThe suspect in this case has been identified as Jake Thomas Patterson, a 21-year-old resident of the area. On Friday, investigators announced charges of kidnapping and murder against Patterson. Police stated that Patterson had meticulously planned his actions and taken steps to avoid detection.\n\nPatterson was apprehended near the house from which Jayme had escaped, and his arrest was facilitated by a description of his vehicle that Jayme had provided. Authorities believe Patterson was searching for the girl when he was taken into custody.\n\nBarron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald expressed his emotions after spending 88 days searching for Jayme, stating, \"The will of a kid to survive \u2013 it's unthinkable.\" Fitzgerald also mentioned that, as of Friday morning, there was no evidence of a relationship between Patterson and the Closs family, nor any social media contact between Patterson and Jayme.\n\nPatterson had a connection to Jayme's hometown, Barron, but the sheriff declined to elaborate on the nature of the connection. He also revealed that Patterson had altered his appearance before the attack and abduction in October, shaving his head to avoid leaving hair behind.\n\nInvestigators are still working to determine the details of Jayme's ordeal and the motives behind Patterson's actions. The search of the house where Jayme had most recently been held is ongoing, and it remains unclear if Jayme had been in the same house for the entire duration of her disappearance or if she was moved to other locations.\n\nThe local district attorney's office plans to issue a criminal complaint next week. Jayme's aunt, Sue Allard, expressed her joy upon learning of Jayme's return, stating, \"Praise the Lord.\"\n\nPolice have stated that they are not searching for any additional suspects, and no one else was found in the house from which Jayme escaped. The FBI special agent in charge of Milwaukee, Justin Tolomeo, described the case as difficult due to the steps the suspect took to evade law enforcement, but commended Jayme for her resilience in escaping.\n\nPatterson is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Monday.",
    " Title: U.S. Withdraws from Arms Trade Treaty, Citing Sovereignty and Domestic Gun Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has been anticipated by gun rights advocates, President Donald Trump announced on Friday that the United States would withdraw as a signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty, a global agreement aimed at regulating the international sale of conventional weapons. The treaty, which was approved by the United Nations General Assembly in 2013 but never ratified by the U.S. Congress, has been a point of contention between the gun lobby and the Obama administration.\n\nSpeaking at the National Rifle Association (NRA) annual convention in Indianapolis, President Trump declared, \"We will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone.\" The NRA, a key backer of Trump's 2016 campaign, was a leading opponent of the treaty, arguing it could impinge on the rights of American gun owners.\n\nThe Arms Trade Treaty has been ratified by 101 countries, including member states of the European Union, but not by the United States. A senior administration official noted that China and Russia are not parties to the treaty. While some U.S. conservatives argue the treaty could open the door to stricter gun regulations at home, some experts say it has no effect on domestic arms sales or gun rights.\n\nThomas Countryman, a former assistant secretary of state who was the lead U.S. negotiator for the treaty, stated, \"The treaty has no impact whatsoever on Second Amendment rights of U.S. citizens.\" Countryman, who was given explicit instructions by the Obama administration to negotiate the treaty's language in a way that would ensure U.S. compliance without changing any domestic laws, added that the U.S. has for decades had strict arms-export laws.\n\nRachel Stohl, managing director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank, described the decision as part of a U.S. retreat from global leadership. \"Un-signing the Arms Trade Treaty will undermine international peace and security, increase irresponsible and illegal sales of conventional weapons, and harm the American economy,\" she said in a statement.\n\nTed Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, praised the president for withdrawing from a treaty that \"has achieved nothing.\" Bromund cited low levels of compliance with the treaty as evidence of its failure and said nations are free to impose their own legal controls on arms exports.\n\nThe decision comes amidst a series of moves by the Trump administration to distance the U.S. from international agreements, including the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the U.S. announced in February it would withdraw from, citing alleged Russian violations.\n\nDuring his third visit as president to an NRA annual convention, Trump pledged his support for gun rights, touted the strength of the U.S. economy, and criticized the recently completed Mueller investigation. Trump also warned the crowd that \"far-left radicals in Congress\" want to take their guns, saying \"that will never happen as long as I'm president, not even close.\"\n\nThe president received a rousing reception from NRA members, despite criticism from some hard-line gun-rights advocates of his record on guns. The only major action Trump had taken on guns since being elected was to ban bump stocks, devices used in the September 2017 Las Vegas massacre that make semiautomatic rifles fire like machine guns. Meanwhile, Trump hasn't signed into law any major pro-gun legislation.",
    " Title: Media Bias Allegations as NBC, CBS, and ABC Ignore Death Threats Against Senator Tim Scott and Pelosi's Controversial Remark\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast to their coverage of political figures' controversial statements and book releases, the liberal broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC, have been accused of ignoring a New York Times report detailing death threats and racial slurs against Republican Senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate.\n\nOn Tuesday, The New York Times published a report by Catie Edmondson, detailing the shocking death threats Senator Scott and his aides have received in recent days. The report mentioned two audio recordings shared by Scott, filled with profanity and racist slurs, including one call where a person discussed putting the senator \"in his crosshairs.\"\n\nSenator Scott, in an interview with The Times, blamed the media for how his police reform legislation was being portrayed. He stated, \"It's interesting that we are on the right side of the police reform conversation, yet we're on the wrong side according to the people, based on the way that we are characterized in the national press.\"\n\nThe broadcast networks' lack of coverage of Senator Scott's ordeal and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's controversial remarks has raised questions about media bias. As reported last week, ABC and NBC skipped the official rollout of Scott's Justice Act, while CBS downplayed it in a 22-second mention.\n\nPelosi's comments, made on CBS News Radio, generated outrage when she said, \"But so far, they were trying to get away with murder, actually, the murder of George Floyd.\" Despite the incendiary, divisive, and blatantly false comment, CBS Evening News had time to promote John Bolton's book, but refused to cover Pelosi's comments made to their own West Coast correspondent, Steve Futterman.\n\nThe lack of coverage and the apparent bias in reporting have sparked a debate about the role of media in shaping public opinion and the need for unbiased, factual, and informative news.",
    " Title: \"Bipartisan Dialogue on Immigration: A Personal Journey and a Surprising Discovery\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Rremida Shkoza, an Albanian-born US citizen and real estate broker, found herself in a bipartisan conversation on immigration, hosted by her friend Tracy Hollister. The conversation, which took place in New York, brought together three Democrats and three Republicans, including a Chinese-American Republican co-host.\n\nShkoza, a refugee who fled communist Albania in 1991, shared her personal experiences of xenophobia and the struggles she faced as a young immigrant. To her surprise, her Republican counterparts, including a Brazilian immigrant and a North Carolina-based conservative, empathized with her story and emphasized the importance of humanizing immigrants and providing humane treatment for migrants and refugees.\n\nThe conversation, which focused on the need for comprehensive immigration reform, revealed a shared desire among participants to balance democratic values with the need to help others. While they acknowledged the challenges posed by immigration, they also agreed on the need to protect American values and provide a beacon for democratic values.\n\nThe conversation also touched on policy differences, with Shkoza raising concerns about the impact of Trump's tax cuts and the need to invest more in working-class Americans. The Republicans, in turn, discussed the importance of learning more about the root causes of immigration and reconsidering foreign aid distribution.\n\nShkoza left the conversation with a newfound hope for bipartisan cooperation, believing that personal connections across party lines are crucial for bridging the empathy gap. She concluded that the lack of empathy is not a deficit, but a lack of personal connection with those across the political spectrum.\n\nThis experience serves as a reminder that dialogue, understanding, and empathy are essential for finding common ground and moving forward in a polarized political climate. As Shkoza puts it, \"We might not have all the answers, but we can start by engaging in conversations with those who may not share our political views, and by humanizing the immigrants and refugees who are seeking a better life in America.\"",
    " Title: Federal Law Enforcement Tactics in Portland Spark Concerns Over Civil Liberties\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Portland, Oregon, federal law enforcement officers have been using unmarked vehicles to detain protesters since July 14, according to reports from Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB). The tactic, which involves detaining individuals without explanation and driving off, has raised concerns over civil liberties and the escalation of federal force on Portland city streets.\n\nFederal officers have charged at least 13 people with crimes related to the protests so far, while others have been arrested and released. Some demonstrators, like Pettibone and O' Shea, claim they were targeted by federal officers for simply wearing black clothing in the area of the demonstration. They attend protests regularly but say they are not \"instigators.\" They don't spray paint buildings, shine laser pointers at officers, or do anything else other than attend protests, which law enforcement has regularly deemed \"unlawful assemblies.\"\n\nPettibone and O' Shea's accounts, along with multiple videos posted online, show officers driving up to people, detaining individuals without explanation, and driving off. The tactic appears to be another escalation in federal force deployed on Portland city streets, as federal officials and President Donald Trump have said they plan to \"quell\" nightly protests outside the federal courthouse and Multnomah County Justice Center that have lasted for more than six weeks.\n\nThe use of unmarked vehicles and unidentified officers has sparked controversy, with some comparing the situation to police tactics in countries like Chile or Argentina, where people have been \"disappeared\" by authorities. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Oregon has called for an investigation into the federal government's actions in Portland.\n\nActing Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf visited Portland on Thursday, where he reiterated the department's commitment to protecting federal facilities and those within them. Mayor Ted Wheeler and other local officials have said they did not ask for help from federal law enforcement and have asked them to leave. Governor Kate Brown called Wolf's visit \"political theater from President Trump\" and said he \"is looking for a confrontation in Oregon in the hopes of winning political points in Ohio or Iowa.\"\n\nThe situation in Portland has raised concerns over the use of federal force in response to protests and the potential for similar tactics to be used in other cities. Critics argue that the federal government's actions in Portland are a violation of the principles of democracy and the rule of law.\n\nAs the situation in Portland continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the federal government will continue to use these tactics in other cities and whether there will be a broader investigation into the actions of federal law enforcement in Portland.",
    " Title: Romney Affirms Individual Mandate in Health Care Law as a Tax Following Supreme Court Ruling\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with CBS News, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney confirmed that the individual mandate in President Obama's health care law is, in fact, a tax. This statement comes just days after Romney's campaign had previously rejected this characterization.\n\nDuring the interview with Jan Crawford, Romney stated, \"While I agreed with the dissent, that's taken over by the fact that the majority of the court said it's a tax. They have spoken.\"\n\nHe further added, \"They concluded it was a tax. That's what it is, and the American people know that President Obama has broken the pledge he made. He said he wouldn't raise taxes on middle-income Americans. Not only did he raise the $500 billion that was already in the bill, it's now clear that his mandate, as described by the Supreme Court, is a tax.\"\n\nOn Monday, Romney's presidential campaign stated that the health care mandate should be considered a penalty and not a tax. This statement by Eric Fehrnstrom, the campaign's spokesman, contradicted the general stance of leading Republicans in Congress and elsewhere, who have been quick to accuse the president of imposing a new tax.\n\n\"The governor disagreed with the ruling of the court,\" Fehrnstrom said Monday on MSNBC's \"The Daily Rundown.\" \"He agreed with the dissent written by Justice Scalia, which very clearly stated that the mandate was not a tax.\"\n\nThe characterization of the mandate is a delicate issue for the Romney campaign, given Romney's past support for universal health care in Massachusetts when he was governor there. While Romney has pledged to repeal what conservatives call Obamacare, he had previously avoided labeling the mandate as a tax, possibly due to his Massachusetts plan including a similar mandate.\n\nRomney made his comments while vacationing in New Hampshire.",
    " Title: Unforced Errors in Politics: A Look at Recent Blunders by Clinton and GOP Senators\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the world of sports, an unforced error is a mistake made by a player that costs them or their team. Similarly, in politics, unforced errors can be just as damaging, especially when the stakes are high, such as the pursuit of power. Recently, two significant unforced errors have been committed by both sides of the political aisle.\n\nHillary Clinton's presumptive nomination as the Democratic candidate for the 2016 presidential election faced a setback due to her use of a private email server while serving as Secretary of State. While it may have seemed like a smart move in light of the Whitewater investigation that led to her husband's impeachment proceedings, the decision to bypass standard e-mail services for government business has raised questions about transparency and accountability.\n\nFor someone who has served in high office, it is questionable why one would not have an official government account to handle business emails while maintaining a separate account for personal correspondence. Clinton's explanation, reminiscent of her husband's defense during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, has been met with skepticism. \"It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is,\" she said, a statement that defies the common sense test for most observers.\n\nFor average voters, the focus on this issue may seem trivial, while partisan players will react along party lines. Democrats argue, \"What's the big deal?\" while Republicans view it as a constitutional controversy that requires further scrutiny.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican Party has also committed an unforced error with the open letter signed by 47 GOP Senators to the Iranian leadership. The letter, which was seen by some as a lesson in constitutional government, was perceived as arrogant and an attempt to sabotage any deal reached between the U.S. and Iran. The signatories, including U.S. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, were criticized for meddling in foreign policy and appearing spiteful.\n\nWhile senators have the constitutional power to approve a treaty and can outlast a president with their six-year terms, the tone and tactics used in the open letter were seen as inappropriate and potentially damaging to U.S. foreign relations.\n\nIn this age of political polarization, these unforced errors are a reminder of the partisan nature of the players and the potential consequences of their actions. Blind arrogance of power, whether in the handling of emails or the flaunting of senatorial power and prestige to a foreign nation, often backfires on those wielding the power.\n\nAs the political landscape continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how these unforced errors will impact the upcoming elections and the future of American politics. However, one thing is clear: the game of politics suffers when unforced errors are made.",
    " Title: Attorney General Establishes Task Force to Combat Violent Anti-Government Extremism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at curbing violent activities by anti-government extremists, Attorney General William Barr has announced the formation of a task force within the Department of Justice (DOJ). The task force, as outlined in a June 26 memo to all heads of department components and U.S. attorneys, is designed to investigate, prosecute, and ultimately eliminate extremist violence that threatens public safety and the rule of law.\n\nIn the memo, Barr expressed concern over the escalating threats to the rule of law, citing instances of violence during recent protests, attacks on law enforcement officers, destruction of public and private property, and threats to innocent bystanders. The memo specifically references the unrest in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd and the subsequent establishment of an \"autonomous zone\" in Seattle, which has been the site of acts of violence, including a recent shooting.\n\nBarr's memo emphasizes that these extremist groups seek to deny constitutional rights to others and resort to illegal methods. The DOJ, according to Barr, has obtained information suggesting that some extremists intend to continue causing chaos. The task force will provide training and resources to local law enforcement to arrest perpetrators of violence and will collaborate closely with the FBI to gather detailed information about violent anti-government extremists, networks, and movements.\n\nThe task force will also share this information with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, particularly in areas where these extremists pose a threat. The announcement coincided with President Donald Trump's signing of an executive order aimed at protecting American monuments, memorials, and statues from destruction.\n\nThe task force's establishment comes amidst ongoing protests, largely peaceful, sparked by the police-custody death of George Floyd. While the protests have seen instances of violence, Barr's memo underscores the DOJ's commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting constitutional rights.",
    " Title: Former Texas Governor Rick Perry Suspends 2016 Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the Eagle Forum in St. Louis on Friday, former Texas Governor Rick Perry announced the suspension of his campaign for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. Perry, who served as governor for 14 years, struggled to gain traction in a crowded and experienced field.\n\nPerry, who attributed his decision to divine intervention, said, \"That is why today I am suspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States.\" He acknowledged the strength of the current Republican field, stating, \"Our party will be in good hands, as long as we listen to the grassroots, listen to that cause of conservatism.\"\n\nSuspending a campaign, in political terms, is equivalent to dropping out of the race. Candidates typically cite technical fundraising issues as the reason for such a move. Perry's decision comes less than a week before the second debate of the primary season.\n\nThis marks the second presidential campaign Perry has ended prematurely, following his 2012 bid, which was labeled one of the biggest campaign failures in modern political history. In his 2016 bid, Perry had pledged to be more prepared and to learn from his mistakes, but he failed to find a niche in the crowded field.\n\nReports emerged last week that Perry had stopped paying his staff, and some of his team had defected to other political campaigns. Michael Dennehy, a Perry supporter and strategist in New Hampshire, expressed his support for Perry's decision, stating, \"It is a shame that a man with the most successful executive experience and the one who can best relate to middle-class America will not be on the ballot as we choose the Republican nominee.\"\n\nPerry was relegated to the second tier in last month's first presidential debate in Ohio, and was set to be in the second tier in next week's debate at the Reagan Presidential Library. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, noted that Perry's demotion in Cleveland was a significant setback.\n\n\"I knew that his demotion in Cleveland was punishing for him,\" Mr. Schlapp said. \"It was really a body blow.\" Perry's departure leaves four candidates in the second-tier debate: Former Sen. Rick Santorum, former New York Gov. George Pataki, Sen. Lindsey Graham, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.\n\nThe main stage, featuring 11 candidates, includes businessman Donald Trump, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio, and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, former Govs. Jeb Bush of Florida and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, and Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio.\n\nPerry concluded his speech by expressing gratitude for his life and family, stating, \"As I approach the next chapter in life, I do so with the love of my life by my side, Anita Perry. We have our house in the country, we have two beautiful children and two adorable grandchildren, four dogs, and the best sunset from our front porch that you could ever imagine.\"",

Klein, has criticized the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for character assassination against President-elect Donald Trump's appointee, Stephen Bannon, and his media company, Breitbart. The ADL, through its president Jonathan Greenblatt, accused Bannon and Breitbart of \"anti-Semitism\" and Israel hatred.\n\nHowever, the ZOA, in its statement, has defended Bannon, stating that he is an \"American patriot who defends Israel & has deep empathy for the Jewish people.\" The ZOA's own analysis of Breitbart articles confirms this, citing several instances where Bannon and Breitbart have taken a stand against anti-Semitism.\n\nFor instance, Bannon, along with his Breitbart team, took action against anti-Semitic rallies at CUNY by urging officials to address the issue. Breitbart has also reported on the Palestinian Authority's dissemination of false information about Israel, such as the baseless claim that Israel poisoned former PA President Yasser Arafat.\n\nMoreover, Breitbart has reported on the human cost of anti-Semitic incidents, such as a swastika being found on a Jewish student's dorm room door, and the rise of anti-Semitic incidents on US college campuses due to the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.\n\nThe ZOA has also highlighted Breitbart's coverage of Iran's violations of the Iran deal, which poses an existential threat to Israel, and its sympathetic reporting on the scourge of anti-Semitic anti-Israel boycotts.\n\nIn light of these actions, the ZOA has expressed its support for Bannon's appointment as chief strategist in the incoming Trump/Pence administration and has called on the ADL to withdraw and apologize for its character assassination of Bannon and Breitbart Media.\n\nThe statement also raises questions about the silence of the ADL and other Bannon critics regarding the inclusion of anti-Israel individuals in Hillary Clinton's advisory team, particularly George Soros, a major donor to Hillary Clinton. The ZOA questions why these critics did not voice similar concerns then.",
    " Title: Attorney General Sessions Calls for Tougher Prosecution Policies, Reversing Obama-Era Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift from Obama-era policies, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has directed federal prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges possible against the majority of suspects, a move that is expected to result in more people being sent to prison for longer terms.\n\nIn a memo sent Thursday night to US attorneys and made public early on Friday, Sessions wrote that the policy affirms the responsibility of the justice department to enforce the law, stating that it is \"moral and just, and produces consistency.\"\n\nThe new policy is a clear departure from Obama administration criminal justice policies that aimed to ease overcrowding in federal prisons and contributed to a national rethinking of how drug criminals were prosecuted and sentenced. Critics argue that the change will subject more lower-level offenders to unfairly harsh mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nSessions contends that a spike in violence in some big cities and the nation's opioid epidemic show the need for a return to tougher tactics. \"The opioid and heroin epidemic is a contributor to the recent surge of violent crime in America,\" Sessions said in remarks prepared for a Thursday speech in Charleston, West Virginia. \"Drug trafficking is an inherently violent business.\"\n\nThe policy memo states that prosecutors should \"charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense\" - something more likely to trigger mandatory minimum sentences. The memo concedes that there will be cases in which \"good judgment\" will warrant a prosecutor to veer from that rule, but any exceptions will need to be approved by top supervisors, and the reasons must be documented.\n\nThe directive rescinds guidance by Sessions' Democratic predecessor, Eric Holder, who told prosecutors they could in some cases leave drug quantities out of charging documents to avoid triggering long sentences. Holder's 2013 initiative, known as Smart on Crime, was aimed at encouraging shorter sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and preserving justice department resources for more serious and violent criminals.\n\nThe Obama policy shift coincided with US Sentencing Commission changes that made tens of thousands of federal drug prisoners eligible for early release, and an Obama administration clemency initiative that freed convicts deemed deserving of a second chance. Combined, those changes led to a steep decline in a federal prison population that now stands at just under 190,000, down from nearly 220,000 in 2013. Nearly half of those inmates are in custody for drug crimes, records show.\n\nObama administration officials cited that decline and a drop in the overall number of drug prosecutions as evidence that policies were working as intended. They argued prosecutors were getting pickier about the cases they were bringing and were seeking mandatory minimum sentences less often.\n\nHowever, some prosecutors felt constrained by the Holder directive and expressed concern that they'd lose plea bargaining leverage \u2013 and a key inducement for cooperation \u2013 without the ability to more freely pursue harsher punishments. Sessions and other justice department officials argue Holder's approach sidestepped federal laws that impose such sentences and created inconsistency across the country in the way defendants are punished. Even while in the Senate, Sessions repeatedly asserted that eliminating mandatory minimums weakened the ability of law enforcement to protect the public.\n\nAdvocates for the previous policy argue that the change will revive the worst aspects of the drug war. \"It looks like we're going to fill the prisons back up after finally getting the federal prison population down,\" said Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums. \"But the social and human costs will be much higher.\"",

At least one uniformed guard was injured and transported to an ambulance, with reports suggesting that the individual is not in life-threatening condition.\n\nAccording to BBC News, helicopter footage showed two cars, one a police vehicle and the other a black vehicle with no insignia, in a junction near the security gates. The cars appear to have collided, and debris is scattered across the intersection. A white cloth is visible beside the black vehicle.\n\nLocal emergency responders are reportedly assisting the NSA police force in handling the incident. The BBC reports that they were unable to obtain an official comment from the NSA.\n\nInitial reports from the UK Mirror and CBS News suggest that two people were injured during the incident, with one fatality and one injured individual being transported to a hospital. The BBC, however, reports only one fatality and one injured individual. CBS News claims that the fatality was one of the two women who attempted to ram the NSA gates, with the other woman being taken to Shock Trauma for treatment.\n\nThe gender of the individuals attacking the NSA headquarters is disputed in various reports. NBC News is claiming that the two people in the car were \"men disguised as women,\" not women. The NBC report does note that drugs were found in the vehicle, coinciding with CBS's claims. CNN is also reporting that the attackers were two men.\n\nFurther updates note that the car was stolen, and there is not yet any indication of an organized terrorist attempt. Instead, the incident is being described as a \"local criminal matter\" by an anonymous official to NBC.\n\nThis is not the first recent report of trouble at NSA headquarters. Earlier this month, the FBI arrested a man for firing shots at the building, as part of a shooting spree that lasted several weeks, including shots fired at a service truck which injured one of the passengers with shattered glass.\n\nUpdate 12:30PM EST: ABC News reports that one of the perpetrators was shot dead on the scene, while the other is \"severely injured\" and is likely not to survive. The injuries of the security officer are said to be non-life-threatening.

He described Somers' death as a murder at the hands of terrorists. Lucy Somers, Luke's sister, learned of her brother's death from the FBI.\n\nPierre Korkie, a teacher abducted in Yemen in May 2013 with his wife, also perished during the failed raid. Yolande Korkie, Pierre's wife, had previously been released by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militants.\n\nAccording to a senior Defense Department official, speaking anonymously due to not being authorized to speak publicly, helicopters dropped U.S. commandos about a mile from the village where Somers was being held. U.S. warplanes flew overhead for protection but did not engage in combat. The commandos, from teams based in the Middle East, killed all of the al-Qaeda-linked terrorists. No U.S. forces were wounded during the operation.\n\nPresident Obama authorized the rescue attempt due to information indicating Somers' life was in immediate danger, including a video released by his terrorist captors this week announcing the journalist would be killed within 72 hours.\n\nU.S. officials believe the militants shot both hostages during a firefight, and that both were alive when American forces pulled them from a building on the group's compound and got them aboard aircraft. Korkie is believed to have died during the flight, while American Somers died on the USS Makin Island, a Navy ship in the region.\n\nThose who knew Somers, who was born in Britain but spent much of his life in America, remembered him as a person drawn to new experiences. Shawn Gillen, an English professor and chairman of Beloit College's journalism program, described Somers as someone who \"really wanted to understand the world.\"\n\nTamarack Song, director of The Teaching Drum Outdoors School in Three Lakes, Wis., met Somers in 2007 when he was hired to edit a book for the school. Song recalled Somers as someone with \"an undying curiosity for human dynamics and for the way people worked.\"\n\nAt a news conference in Bahrain on Saturday, Yemen's national security chief, Maj. Gen. Ali al-Ahmadi, stated that the militants had planned to kill Somers on Saturday. Al-Qaeda had promised to conduct the execution, but unfortunately, they shot the hostage before or during the attack, according to al-Ahmadi.\n\nPierre Korkie was set to be released on Sunday, according to Gift of Givers, the aid group that negotiated his wife's freedom. The psychological and emotional devastation to Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was to be released by al-Qaeda, the aid group stated.\n\nIn a YouTube video released Wednesday, Somers, 33, said his \"life is in danger.\" The video featured an al-Qaeda official and a brief message from Somers\u2014dressed in a purple shirt and with a shaved head\u2014at the end.\n\nPentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby stated on Thursday that a U.S. raid last month attempted to free Somers, but he was not present at the site. Before her brother's death, Lucy Somers released an online video describing him as a romantic who \"always believes the best in people.\" She ended with the plea: \"Please let him live.\"",

Mexico's minister for public security confirmed the incident on Tuesday, stating that three women and six children were killed in broad daylight as they traveled on a highway.\n\nThe attack took place when one vehicle stopped due to a flat tire, and assailants attacked the stranded car, killing the driver and four children, including 6-month-old twins. The attackers then set the car on fire. Two other cars were attacked nearby, resulting in the deaths of two women and two children.\n\nA family member described a harrowing scene where a child was gunned down while attempting to flee. It is believed that at least eight survivors remain, including as many as seven children who reportedly managed to escape. Some of the escaped children were seriously wounded, including a 9-month-old who was shot in the chest and a 4-year-old who was shot in the back. A 13-year-old reportedly walked 14 miles to the family's home to seek help after hiding his wounded siblings in the brush.\n\nThe targets of the attack were members of a farming community of Mormon settlers who moved south of the border nearly a century ago to practice polygamy after a dispute with the church over the practice.\n\nIn response to the incident, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted, \"Wonderful family and friends from Utah got caught between two vicious drug cartels, who were shooting at each other, with the result being many great American people killed, including young children, and some missing.\" He further stated, \"If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these monsters, the United States stands ready, willing, and able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively.\"\n\nTrump also tweeted, \"The cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!\" The tweets suggest a potential U.S. involvement in addressing the ongoing drug cartel violence in Mexico.",

Known for his unwavering evangelistic organization and eloquent preaching style, Graham's influence spanned generations and continents.\n\nDana Robert, a Boston University religion professor, remembered Graham fondly, recalling her personal encounter with him at a crusade in Baton Rouge in 1970. \"It's a blessing he's been released to be with Jesus,\" she said. \"He lived a good life, and he can say, as Paul did in his letter to Timothy, 'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.' For him, death is not the end.\"\n\nLarry Ross, Graham's longtime spokesman, praised the evangelist's courage and faith during his long physical decline. \"He was faithful to the end,\" he said. \"He showed how to finish well.\"\n\nNews of Graham's death spread globally, from missionaries' huts in Africa to back-country Bible Belt churches to mighty Southern Baptist temples. His life was recalled by Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, and Jews; by those who attended one of his crusades, or dozens; by those who only saw him on TV or heard him on the radio; by those who knew him mostly as a pastor to presidents.\n\nRandall Balmer, a Dartmouth College expert on evangelical Christianity, described Graham as \"the most prominent religious celebrity of the 20th Century,\" a period that included popes John XXIII and John Paul II, the 14th Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa, and Norman Vincent Peale. Balmer estimated that, even if the audiences for Graham's many broadcasts are not counted, \"he preached to more people in person than anyone in history.\"\n\nThose with the strongest impressions of Graham saw him at his final big public events. Craig Allen, 74, of Finksburg, MD, heard Graham's last major sermon, delivered in Oriole Park at Camden Yards in 2006. \"His perseverance despite his health was phenomenal,\" Allen said. \"They brought him out on a cart, and they had to help him up to the mic. And then, boy, he delivered a powerful sermon. No matter how he felt, he was going to give it his all.\"\n\nMichael Freeland, 59, of Metairie, LA, attended a Graham crusade in New Orleans in 2006, after Hurricane Katrina the previous year. \"His presence after the storm, especially after announcing his retirement the previous year, meant a lot to us,\" Freeland said. \"He was old, he'd lost his wife. You could see his frailty. But once he started to preach, you could feel an energy. That was the Holy Spirit. That was him doing something he was passionate about.\"\n\nMaggie Rousseau and her husband, Bill, drove 14 hours from Savannah, GA, to see Graham for the first time in 2005, knowing it would be the last. \"There was just something about him,\" Maggie said. \"I don't know what it was, but you believed him. On the crusades, on TV, he spoke, and you listened.\"\n\nHowever, some argue that Graham's impact has already diminished. When Balmer asked one of his classes at Dartmouth if they knew who Billy Graham was, only 25% raised a hand. Dana Robert described Graham as essentially a phenomenon of the Greatest and Boomer generations. \"When I was young, the whole family watched him on television, like Walter Cronkite. When he came to town, everyone went to the crusade,\" she recalled. \"But I don't think the Millennials even know who he was.\"",
    " Title: The Dilemma of Balancing Public Health and Economic Recovery: A Look at the United States' Struggle Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States, like many other countries, is grappling with the challenging task of balancing public health and economic recovery amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. On May 7, the U.S. reported 2,231 deaths due to the virus, bringing the total number of deaths in the country to 75,662, and over 270,000 worldwide.\n\nThe economic impact has been severe. In April, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office predicted that the second quarter of 2020 would witness the first drop in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product in six years, with the worst decline since 2008. Since March, 33.5 million people have filed for unemployment. Companies, both large and small, are facing closure, along with millions of jobs. Consumer spending, business investment, manufacturing\u2014everything is in a freefall, and it's unlikely to improve until 2021, even if the pandemic eases and doesn't return with a second wave.\n\nThe choice seems stark: maintain strict social distancing and shelter-in-place measures to minimize the spread of COVID-19 and save thousands of lives, or end the lightweight lockdown\u2014open all the shops, restart the factories\u2014and save the economy. President Trump recently stated, \"We can't keep our country closed. We have to open our country.\" However, the point of social distancing was to \"flatten the curve,\" to slow the spread of the virus so that hospitals wouldn't be overwhelmed and governments could take public health measures like widespread testing and tracing the contacts of sick people to keep people safe.\n\nThe question of how much a human life is worth has been raised, with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stating, \"How much is a human life worth? That is the real discussion that no one is admitting, openly or freely\u2014that we should.\" Cuomo emphasized, \"To me, I say the cost of a human life, a human life is priceless.\"\n\nThe federal government has largely abandoned its own standards for when states should lift their shelter-in-place orders. A researcher at the respected Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security told Congress last week that no state looked epidemiologically ready to go back to normal.\n\nDespite this, 31 states have decided to reopen, with Texas allowing restaurants and movie theaters to reopen at 25% capacity, while acknowledging privately that COVID-19 cases will certainly increase as a result. Georgia is lifting its stay-at-home order and allowing places from tattoo parlors to bowling alleys to reopen, while California, which battened down early, is opening some southern beaches.\n\nThe information about the virus is incomplete and sometimes contradictory. The same is true for information about its impact on the national economy. The uncertainty extends to what people will contribute to the economy even if states end official restrictions. Given this uncertainty, who is going to get on an airplane next week, or go to a crowded bar?\n\nAs a society, we have historically been willing to incur costs to save lives and improve public welfare. Government forces carmakers to reduce air pollution to help people with asthma, and the price of cars goes up. Laws prevent factories from polluting to save fisheries, and goods cost more. But that kind of tradeoff clearly has limits. Few people suggest deactivating the country's financial engines to fight opioid addiction deaths or flu or heart disease or traffic accidents. Why do it for this one very bad respiratory virus?",
    " Title: Trump Suggests Softening Stance on Illegal Immigration, Emphasizes Deportation of Criminals and Calls for End to Sanctuary Cities\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has indicated a potential softening of his stance on illegal immigration, while maintaining his commitment to deporting criminal immigrants. During a town hall with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday, Trump reiterated that there would be \"no amnesty\" for illegal immigrants, but suggested a more collaborative approach, stating, \"Let me go a step further- they'll pay back-taxes, they have to pay taxes, there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them.\"\n\nTrump also clarified that there would be no path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. He expressed empathy towards those who have lived in the U.S. for decades and raised families, acknowledging the complexity of deporting long-term residents.\n\nThe Republican nominee also criticized sanctuary cities, claiming they protect criminals and hinder law enforcement. He asserted, \"We got to get rid of the sanctuary cities, we're protecting these people. We're protecting criminals. And the police, who are phenomenal people, they're at a point where they almost give up.\"\n\nTrump is expected to announce a decision on his immigration policy \"very soon.\" According to the Associated Press, he will unveil his new policy during a speech in Phoenix next week at the Hyatt Regency. The speech is expected to cover policy matters, with the topic of immigration being a primary focus.",
    " Title: Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Oregon, and Idaho Hold Primary Elections on Tuesday\n\nArticle:\n\nTuesday will see primary elections in several key states, including Pennsylvania, Idaho, Nebraska, and Oregon. The elections will help shape the political landscape, particularly in Pennsylvania, where a court fight over redrawn districts ended just three months ago.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, primary voters will decide the fate of President Donald Trump's pick for U.S. Senate, as well as the candidates for 18 House districts. The new congressional map, implemented following court-ordered redrawing in February, has resulted in a record number of candidates - 84 - running in these districts, a phenomenon not seen since 1984 when Pennsylvania had 23 seats in the House.\n\nFive of Pennsylvania's 13 GOP House members have quit or are not running again, creating seven House vacancies, the most since 1976. The 7th District, abandoned by moderate Charlie Dent, is one such vacancy. Hillary Clinton received more votes than Trump in this district, which was reunified with Democratic-leaning cities in the east and cut out some Republican-leaning central Pennsylvania. Six Democrats are running in this district.\n\nIn suburban Philadelphia's 5th District, where Rep. Patrick Meehan resigned last month amid sexual harassment allegations, ten Democrats are running. Clinton also beat Trump in this district.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary, Rep. Lou Barletta is heavily favored to become the Republican challenger for Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, who is seeking a third term in November. Barletta, a Trump supporter, has the president's endorsement.\n\nIn Nebraska, Tuesday's Democratic primary in the 2nd Congressional District, dominated by Omaha and its suburbs, features moderate former Rep. Brad Ashford fighting for his old seat and Kara Eastman, a children's nonprofit administrator, running to Ashford's left. Ashford, a former Republican, served one term in Congress as a Democrat before losing to Republican Don Bacon in 2016.\n\nIn Idaho, the primary goes a long way to determining the general election, as Republican Gov. C.L. \"Butch\" Otter is not seeking re-election after three terms. Lt. Gov. Brad Little is seeking the GOP nomination, with Otter's endorsement, while Tommy Ahlquist, an emergency room doctor turned developer, hopes his outsider status carries him as it did Indiana businessman Mike Braun in last week's GOP Senate primary.\n\nIn Oregon, ten Republicans are vying for the nomination for governor - the most in more than a century. The interest among candidates belies the uphill climb for the party in the Democratic-leaning state. Businessman Sam Carpenter, state Rep. Knute Buehler, and retired Navy pilot Greg Wooldridge have emerged as leaders in fundraising and GOP straw polls. However, Democratic Gov. Kate Brown remains the favorite to win in November.\n\nOregon is among eight states where Democrats control the governorship and both houses of the state legislature. Voters who identify as Democrats also outnumber their Republican counterparts by more than 9 percentage points.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows in August, Missing Expectations Amid Trade Uncertainty and Global Growth Concerns\n\nThe U.S. economy added 130,000 jobs in August, falling short of Wall Street's expectations, as trade tensions and global economic slowdown cast a shadow over the economic outlook. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7%, near a half-century low, while the labor force participation rate remained unchanged at 63.2%. Average hourly earnings rose 3.2% over the past year to $28.11, slightly exceeding projections of 3.1%.\n\nEconomists had anticipated employers to add 158,000 jobs, in line with average growth this year but significantly below the 2018 average of 223,000. The June and July jobs numbers were revised down by a combined 20,000, according to the Labor Department's report released on Friday.\n\nThe employment in the federal government increased in the last full month of summer, primarily due to the hiring of temporary workers for the 2020 census. Excluding these employees, August payrolls grew by 105,000 jobs. Notable gains were also reported in the health care sector, which added 24,000 jobs, and the finance industry, which grew by 15,000.\n\nThe subpar job growth comes amid concerns that the current U.S. economic expansion, which has reached a record length, may be slowing and could potentially lead to a recession within the next two years. Industries on the front line of the U.S.-China trade war continued to report losses.\n\nTony Bedikian, managing director at Citizens Bank, commented, \"The on-again, off-again U.S.-China trade talks continue to roil markets and, in some ways, are mirroring the on-again, off-again Brexit debate. Both issues are providing market participants with more theater than substance while the U.S. consumer tunes them out, keeps spending, and keeps the U.S. economic fundamentals on track.\"\n\nThe lower-than-expected growth may prompt the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates by a modest 25 basis points when policymakers meet in mid-September. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to discuss the economic outlook in a speech later Friday in Zurich.",
    " Title: California Imposes Statewide 'Stay At Home' Order as Coronavirus Cases Surge\n\nIn a significant move to combat the growing novel coronavirus outbreak, California Governor Gavin Newsom has ordered the state's 40 million residents to stay at home indefinitely. This directive, announced on March 19, is the most extensive measure taken by any state in the U.S. to date.\n\nGovernor Newsom, in a late-evening news conference in Sacramento, stated that the order would take effect immediately. He expressed confidence that Californians would comply with the measure, saying, \"We are confident that the people of the state of California will abide by it, will do the right thing.\"\n\nThe order, which follows similar restrictions issued earlier this week for the San Francisco Bay Area, requires individuals to remain in their homes, with exceptions only for essential travel. Exemptions to the order include trips to grocery stores, gas stations, farmers markets, food banks, convenience stores, takeout and delivery restaurants, banks, and laundromats, among others.\n\nCalifornia, one of the states hardest-hit by the U.S. outbreak, has over 1,000 confirmed cases of the potentially fatal respiratory infection, with 19 deaths. The governor previously stated that an official projection estimates that up to 56% of the state's residents could become infected by the virus, a figure that would equate to more than 22 million people. However, he emphasized at the news conference that the stay-at-home order is intended to make such numbers irrelevant.\n\nThe total number of cases in the U.S. has surpassed 10,000, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, officials believe that due to the small number of tests for the virus so far, the actual number of infections is thought to be significantly higher.\n\nThe global total of reported cases, according to a tally maintained by Johns Hopkins University, is nearly 250,000, with over 10,000 deaths. California Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, expressed concern about the order, tweeting, \"I hope Governor Newsom consulted with a lot of experts before he decided to shut down 12% of the nation's population.\"\n\nDespite the seemingly sweeping nature of the governor's order, there are a number of exemptions, Newsom said. He emphasized that grocery stores would remain open, and individuals could still take their children outside, walk their dogs, and practice common sense and social distancing. Essential travel and critical infrastructure such as food and agriculture, health care, transportation, energy, and financial services are also exempted.",
    " Title: Attorney General Eric Holder's Mixed Legacy on National Security Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his tenure as Attorney General, Eric Holder faced a complex and challenging landscape in handling national security matters. As he steps down, his legacy is marked by both successes and controversies.\n\nHolder, who served as Attorney General since the start of President Obama's presidency in 2009, took office with a clear intention to distance the Justice Department from the Bush administration's policies on interrogation techniques and terrorism prosecutions. However, his decisions have drawn scrutiny and disappointment from various quarters.\n\nOne of Holder's most audacious proposals was to prosecute the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks and other alleged co-conspirators in a New York courtroom, rather than through the Guantanamo Bay military commission process. This idea was met with political opposition and public safety concerns, ultimately leading to the Obama administration's decision to abandon the plan.\n\nHolder's tenure saw numerous terrorism-fighting successes, including the prosecutions of the Times Square bomb plot and the Detroit-bound airliner bomb plot. However, his watch also saw the authorization of targeted drone strikes against Americans abroad, subpoenas of journalists' telephone records in leak investigations, and the defense in court of the government's bulk collection of millions of Americans' telephone records.\n\nJonathan Hafetz, a Seton Hall University law professor and former senior lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, described Holder's legacy as \"too supportive of executive power and insufficiently protective of civil liberties.\" Stephen Vladeck, an American University law school professor, credited Holder for overseeing a large number of terrorism prosecutions but noted that the visible aspects of his legacy \"don't look as good as the stuff we don't see.\"\n\nWhen Holder took over, he signaled a new direction from the previous Republican administration. He defined waterboarding as torture, announced an investigation into CIA interrogation methods, and pushed for a shift away from the military commission system. In 2009, he announced plans to prosecute five detainees, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in federal court in New York and seek the death penalty.\n\nCritics, mostly Republicans, argued that federal courts were ill-equipped for such trials and expressed alarm at the prospect of terrorists being brought to American soil. The White House shelved the idea in 2011, a step toward closing the Guantanamo detention facility.\n\nDespite this setback, Holder remained firm in his support for civilian courts for suspected terrorists, and his Justice Department has won many convictions before American juries. He has said his position was vindicated by the fact that, in the years since the Guantanamo proposal was spiked, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law was captured, convicted in New York, and given a life sentence. The military commission case against Mohammed remains stalled in Guantanamo by pretrial wrangling.\n\nHowever, Holder's civil liberties advocates were frustrated when he later defended the administration's legal rationale to kill American-born Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen. They challenged the government's ability to kill one of its citizens without court permission and its refusal, until recently, to release the memo authorizing the strike.\n\nAdditional scrutiny came from the administration's crackdown on news media reporting involving national security matters. The Justice Department secretly subpoenaed phone records from Associated Press reporters and editors, used a search warrant to obtain some emails of a Fox News journalist in another leak investigation, and subpoenaed New York Times reporter James Risen in the case of a former CIA officer accused of disclosing government secrets. Holder has since issued new guidelines for media leak investigations.\n\nAs Holder steps down, his successor will inherit many of the same policy questions, including how to close the Guantanamo detention facility, handle potential foreign fighters trying to join extremist groups in Syria, and bring former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden into a U.S. courtroom.\n\n\"The public's perspective, I think, may be very different from the attorney general's perspective. He knows all the things that never made the front pages,\" said Vladeck. It remains to be seen how Holder's successor will navigate these complex issues and shape the future of national security policy.",
    " Title: U.S. Officials Disagree on Safety of Iraqi Christians as Deportation Efforts Continue\n\nArticle:\n\nA divide in the assessment of the safety of Iraqi Christians has emerged within the Trump administration, as U.S. immigration officials push to deport hundreds of Iraqi Christians while a senior Trump appointee at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) insists that Christians in Iraq face terror and extortion.\n\nLast September, Hallam Ferguson, a senior Trump appointee at USAID, told a government commission that in the part of northern Iraq where many Christians live, militias aligned with Iran \"terrorize those families brave enough to have returned, extort local businesses and openly pledge allegiance to Iran.\" Ferguson stated that in some towns, the numbers of Christians who have returned after the defeat of the Islamic State \"have reached only 1 to 2% because of persecution by these militias.\"\n\nOn the same day, Michael Rubin, a Middle East expert at the American Enterprise Institute, completed a sworn declaration at the request of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for use in its efforts to deport Iraqis. Rubin argued that Iraq is now a more stable country with an increasingly professional government, and that Iraqi Christians could count on the state's protection and are \"largely immune\" from politically motivated violence.\n\nGovernment lawyers have submitted Rubin's statement, along with similar declarations by two other experts, to courts during immigration hearings. The Rubin declaration was submitted by DHS lawyers as recently as last month.\n\nThe assessments by Rubin and the other experts can have significant consequences. The administration has sought to deport hundreds of Iraqis, many of them Christians, who immigrated to the U.S. years ago. To stay in the U.S., many of the Iraqis have to prove that if they are deported, they are most likely to be tortured by, or with the tacit permission of, the Iraqi government\u2014a higher standard than what is used in typical asylum cases. That gives DHS a strong incentive to emphasize Iraq's progress and portray the country's government as competent and willing to protect all its people.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in a January speech in Michigan that he would grant an \"extension\" to Iraqi Christians facing deportation, but DHS's effort to deport the Iraqis is ongoing, lawyers said. In approving one Iraqi Christian's deportation late last year, an immigration judge wrote that he found the experts' declarations \"persuasive\" and was convinced that \"the Iraqi government has cracked down\" on abuses by the majority-Shiite Muslim militias that helped defeat the Islamic State but have not disbanded since its demise.\n\nIn an emailed response to questions, Rubin said that he does not agree with the Trump administration's policy of deporting the Iraqis, but that he had been asked for an informed assessment and not his political opinion. \"The only question I focus on when contributing declarations or when asked in court is whether Christians returning to Iraq are likely to be subject to detention, torture or murder upon their return, and the answer to that objectively is no,\" Rubin said.\n\nRubin said he plans to update his statement to address recent unrest in Iraq, where there have been widespread demonstrations and the killing of hundreds of mostly unarmed protesters. The two other experts who took similar positions as Rubin, Denise Natali and Douglas Ollivant, did not respond to requests for comment. Natali is now a senior State Department official.\n\nThe State Department, USAID, DHS, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment, and the Iraqi Embassy in Washington did not offer a response either. While the Iraqi government has succeeded in defeating the Islamic State and winning back control of its territory, religious and ethnic minorities have little faith the government can protect them against a multitude of active, semiofficial armed groups, experts said.\n\n\"My view aligns more closely with USAID,\" said Steven Cook, a Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, who visited Iraq in December. \"Iraq seems to be in a situation of terminal collapse. With the continued presence of extremists and the unreliable central government, I find it hard to believe that Christians are safe and secure.\"",
    " Title: Virginia Election Results Reveal Anti-Immigrant Strategy Backfires, Demonstrating Potential 2018 Trend\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent Virginia gubernatorial election, the anti-immigrant strategy employed by Republican candidate Ed Gillespie proved to be a misstep, as demonstrated by the election results and polling data. While each state has its unique demographics and politics, Virginia's electorate encompasses a diverse range of demographics and economic backgrounds. Majorities of voters across racial and ethnic lines rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as unattractive and incorrect.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey by Latino Decisions, Latino voters expressed disapproval of Gillespie's MS-13 ads, with a 45-point margin. However, this sentiment was not limited to the Latino community. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), white voters in Virginia also indicated that the MS-13 ads turned them away from Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData analysis of survey data reveals a clear trend. Exposure to Gillespie's MS-13 ads drove white college-educated voters away from the Republican party. Furthermore, when analyzing findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Gillespie's Democratic opponent.\n\nThe impact of the MS-13 ads was not confined to the governor's race. The Gillespie campaign's influence extended to Virginia's House of Delegates races, with those aware of the MS-13 ads being significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates.\n\nThis trend suggests that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American, and Asian-American voters, while also appealing to white voters who oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly relevant to voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters, also known as the Democratic base. President Trump and his fellow Republicans are reportedly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. However, the Virginia election results indicate that voters are becoming increasingly aware of such tactics and are less likely to support candidates who employ them.\n\nDemocrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry and present themselves as a welcoming, inclusive party. By doing so, they may have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.",
    " Title: President Trump Calls for \"Red Wave\" to Pass Immigration Bill as Congressional Vote Delayed\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, President Donald Trump called for a \"red wave\" in the November midterm elections to pass an immigration bill, accusing Democrats of obstructing efforts to address the long-standing issue.\n\n\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November,\" Trump tweeted. \"Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solve this decades-old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\"\n\nThe president's call comes after GOP leaders abruptly scrapped a planned vote on a troubled immigration bill on Thursday, pushing the vote into next week. The House GOP Abruptly Scraps Planned Vote on Troubled Immigration Bill, Saying It Could Pass Next Week.\n\nCongressional Republicans had earlier failed to pass a more conservative bill. A more moderate, compromise measure was expected to include a requirement that employers use E-Verify to check the legal status of employees.\n\nLeaders have sought to assuage both conservatives and moderates in their party, while also meeting the president's four pillars: a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children, border security including a wall, an end to so-called \"chain migration,\" and an end to the diversity lottery visa.\n\nA sticking point for conservatives is that while the compromise funds the wall, it also offers a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million young illegal immigrants. The conservative bill offers only the 700,000 recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program the ability to apply for indefinite renewals of non-immigrant status.\n\n\"It is not a compromise,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters. \"It may be a compromise with the devil, but it is not a compromise with the Democrats.\"\n\nTrump on Wednesday extended an invitation to Democrats to the White House to discuss immigration and said \"it takes two to tango,\" although he had scathing words for what he called the \"extremist, open border\" lawmakers.\n\n\"They don't care about the children... They don't care about the problems. They do not care about anything. All they do is say, 'Obstruct and let's see how we do' because they have no policies that are any good,\" he said ahead of a Cabinet meeting.\n\nOn Thursday, he echoed that rhetoric, but without the invitation for Democrats to come to the table.\n\n\"Dems are doing nothing but Obstructing. Remember their motto, RESIST! Ours is PRODUCE!\" he tweeted.\n\nHe renewed his criticism of the filibuster in the Senate, which requires 60 votes to break.\n\n\"Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate, we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much-needed Immigration Bill - & the Dems are Obstructionists who won\u2019t give votes for political reasons & because they don\u2019t care about Crime coming from Border! So we need to elect more R\u2019s!\"\n\nTrump's tweets come after a fiery week in which rhetoric on both sides has escalated on the question of the administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy, which prosecutes all illegal border crossers. That in turn led to an increase in the number of children being separated from their parents.\n\nTrump signed an executive order Wednesday ending the practice and allowing families to be detained together, but Democrats have since pushed for ending what they described as \"indefinite detention\" of families at the border.",
    " Title: Misinterpretation of Netanyahu's Remarks on Palestinian State Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with the Israeli publication NRG, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comments regarding a potential Palestinian state have been misconstrued by the Western media, leading to a flurry of inaccurate reports.\n\nThe misinterpretation began with a headline from the left-wing Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz, which reported Netanyahu as saying, \"If I'm elected, there will be no Palestinian state.\" The rest of the media quickly followed suit, accusing Netanyahu of flip-flopping on his stance towards a Palestinian state.\n\nHowever, the interview took place in Hebrew, a language that most Western journalists do not read or speak, and the misinterpretation appears to have stemmed from a mistranslation or misinterpretation of Netanyahu's words.\n\nIn the interview, Netanyahu was asked directly about whether his 2009 speech at Bar Ilan University, where he expressed support for the possibility of a Palestinian state, was \"irrelevant.\" Netanyahu's response was misconstrued as a rejection of a Palestinian state, but in reality, he said:\n\nNETANYAHU: I think anyone who is going to build a Palestinian state today will be freeing up space to give an attack area to radical Islam against Israel. This is the reality created here in recent years. Anyone who ignores this sticks his head in the sand. The left does this, burying its head in the sand again and again. We are realistic and understand\u2026\n\nNRG: If you are elected head of state, no Palestinian state will come to fruition?\nNETANYAHU: Indeed.\nNRG: Construction in Jerusalem and the West Bank will renew?\nNETANYAHU: We are continuing all the time, but that's not a question about additional building. There is a real threat that the government of the left will join the international community and do their bidding\u2026\n\nNetanyahu continued by arguing that the left would buy into the \"international initiatives to return to the 1967 borders and divide Jerusalem.\"\n\nIn other words, Netanyahu did not discount the possibility of a Palestinian state forever. He said that anyone who tries to build a Palestinian state \"today\" would be giving territory to radical Islam. He even added that this was a reality created in recent years.\n\nTo read that as a wholesale rejection of a Palestinian state is to lie, as Ha'aretz did. The entire lazy and ridiculous world media followed suit, accusing Netanyahu of flip-flopping when, in fact, he never flipped.\n\nNetanyahu's policy is the same as the policy of Yitzchak Rabin, who created the Oslo Accords and said just one month before his assassination in 1995, \"We view a permanent solution [involving] a Palestinian entity which is less than a state\u2026 We will not return to the June 4, 1967 lines\u2026 We committed ourselves before the Knesset not to uproot a single settlement in the framework of the interim agreement, and not to hinder building for natural growth\u2026 And first and foremost in our concerns is a united Jerusalem, as the capital of Israel, under Israeli sovereignty.\"\n\nBen Shapiro, Senior Editor-At-Large of \u2588\u2588\u2588 and author of the new book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014), weighed in on the controversy.

    " Title: Ted Cruz and Donald Trump Engage in Legal Threats Over Abortion Ad in South Carolina\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange between the two Republican presidential candidates, Ted Cruz has dared Donald Trump to sue him over an ad running in South Carolina that questions Trump's record on abortion. The ad, which features footage of Trump in a 1999 interview stating he is \"very pro-choice,\" has sparked a legal battle between the two candidates.\n\nCruz, in a press conference on Wednesday, read from the cease-and-desist letter sent by Trump's campaign, calling it \"one of the most remarkable letters I have ever read.\" He challenged Trump to follow through with his threatened lawsuit. Cruz, a Harvard Law School graduate and former Texas solicitor general, stated that a lawsuit against the ad has no chance and expressed his desire to take Trump's deposition himself.\n\nTrump, in response, reiterated his current pro-life stance and threatened to sue Cruz over his eligibility to run for president if he does not \"take down his false ads and retract his lies.\" The feud between the two candidates has escalated since then, with Trump regularly labeling Cruz a liar and Cruz mocking Trump's lawsuit threats.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Trump said, \"If I want to bring a lawsuit it would be legitimate. Likewise, if I want to bring the lawsuit regarding Senator Cruz being a natural-born Canadian, I will do so. Time will tell, Teddy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Cruz is also embroiled in a dispute with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio over alleged dirty tricks leading up to Saturday's South Carolina GOP primary. Cruz denied any involvement in any untoward activities and called for anyone with evidence to come forward. Rubio was asked on Wednesday to provide evidence that Cruz's team was behind a fake Facebook page wrongly claiming that U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy had switched his endorsement from Rubio to Cruz.\n\n\"It's just a pattern of people around his campaign that have continuously done things like that,\" Rubio said. The primary is set to take place on Saturday, and the ongoing disputes between the candidates are likely to continue shaping the race in the coming days.",
    " Title: BuzzFeed Report Alleges President Trump Directed Michael Cohen to Lie About Moscow Project\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, BuzzFeed News has reported that President Donald Trump directed his former lawyer Michael Cohen to lie about his Trump Tower project in Moscow. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying about the deal in testimony and in a two-page statement to the Senate and House intelligence committees.\n\nAccording to the report, Cohen also told the special counsel that after the election, the president personally instructed him to lie\u2014by claiming that negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did\u2014in order to obscure Trump's involvement.\n\nThe allegation, if true, could be the most serious threat to Trump's presidency, according to Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), who reacted to the news on CNN Friday. Cicilline, along with Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), concluded that BuzzFeed has proven the president is guilty of obstruction of justice.\n\n\"If the President directed Cohen to lie to Congress, that is obstruction of justice. Period. Full stop,\" Cicilline tweeted. Lieu added, \"Based on the Buzzfeed report and numerous other articles showing @realDonaldTrump committed Obstruction of Justice and other possible felonies, it is time for the House Judiciary Committee to start holding hearings to establish a record of whether @POTUS committed high crimes.\"\n\nGiven the seriousness of the allegation, the congressmen demanded they and their colleagues be given a chance to investigate. Cicilline, when asked by CNN's John Berman if he's calling for an immediate congressional investigation into the report, said, \"I think we have to wait for the reports to be confirmed before we can call on that... You have one opportunity to move forward on something so serious.\"\n\nHowever, when asked if he has evidence to prove Trump told Cohen to lie, Cicilline said, \"We've all seen the conduct of the president.\" Berman noted that wasn't an answer and asked again, did he actually see the evidence? \"I have not seen the evidence referenced in that article,\" Cicilline admitted.\n\nOne of the authors of the BuzzFeed report, Anthony Cormier, stood by his reporting on CNN Friday as \"100 percent\" truth. The report, as of now, has yet to be confirmed or corroborated.",
    " Title: Boehner Stands Firm on Debt Ceiling and Government Shutdown Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a Sunday interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" House Speaker John Boehner reiterated that Republican lawmakers will not agree to a debt ceiling increase without conditions to curb deficit spending. Boehner stated unequivocally that the Republican-led House would not pass a \"clean\" debt ceiling increase, and that it is time to address America's problems rather than merely raising the debt limit without addressing the underlying issue.\n\nThe interview came as the country entered its sixth day of a government shutdown, with Boehner equally adamant that Republicans would demand concessions for any bill to reopen the government. Specifically, Republicans are pushing for changes to President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, known as Obamacare, as a condition for backing a measure to fund government agencies.\n\nPresident Obama and the Democratic-led Senate have rejected this demand, and Obama has stated that it is the responsibility of Congress to raise the debt limit by an Oct. 17 deadline when the government will begin running short of the funds needed to pay its bills. Obama has also said he will not negotiate with Republicans over the debt limit issue.\n\nRegarding the government shutdown impasse, Boehner said there had been no changes in the Republican position on the bill to fund the government. Boehner also stated that there are not enough votes in the House to pass a \"clean\" continuing resolution on the budget to re-open the government.\n\nWhen asked about a group of 195 House Democrats and 21 Republicans who have said they are willing to pass a six-week \"clean CR\" without defunding Obamacare, Boehner responded, \"There may be a back room somewhere, but there's nobody in it.\"\n\nBoehner repeated the GOP line that his party has tried to compromise by passing several bills that would fund parts of the government while talks continue. However, Democrats have rejected all but a bill to fund military pay because they say the effort is a ploy to simply fund every part of government individually except the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBoehner used the word \"conversation\" a total of 22 times in the interview, stating that President Obama knows his phone number and can call him any time. Host George Stephanopoulos played past quotes from Boehner in which he has said Obamacare is the law of the land and that defunding Obamacare should not be tied to the budget.\n\nBoehner acknowledged making a promise to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to pass a clean CR that included $70 billion less than what the Senate wanted. However, Boehner said, \"I and my members decided that the threat of Obamacare and what was happening was so important that it was time for us to take a stand \u2013 and we took a stand.\"\n\nThe interview concluded with a call to action for viewers to vote on whether they support Sen. Ted Cruz's efforts to defund Obamacare.",
    " Title: Critics Question Limited Scope of U.S. Airstrikes Against Islamic State and Khorasan Group\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing air war against the Islamic State and the Khorasan Group, President Obama's approach is facing criticism, with some claiming that the limited scope of the airstrikes is hindering the effectiveness of the campaign. This criticism stems from the sparing of a bombing target in Syria, where a U.S.-led airstrike left intact a building housing the Islamic State's finance center, despite destroying the rooftop communications array.\n\nThe limited effectiveness of the airstrikes is further compounded by the mixed results of Iraqi security forces in combat and their inability to reverse most gains made by the Islamic State, also known by the acronyms ISIL and ISIS. Iraqi troops also lack the crucial skill of finding and designating ground targets for U.S. warplanes, making the American air campaign more challenging.\n\nRetired CIA operative Bart Bechtel expressed his frustration, stating, \"I was mad as hell when I saw the hit on a supposed ISIL building. The right question is: Why not the whole building?\" He further opined that the airstrikes were a public relations move to show that Obama is taking decisive action, rather than a genuine attempt to destroy the Islamic State.\n\nA retired Air Force general, who remains in touch with the jet fighter community, echoed these sentiments, stating that the U.S. air war is too narrow, with insufficient planes, heavy ordnance, or sorties. Before the first assaults in Syria on Monday night, U.S. Central Command had conducted 190 airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq since Aug. 8 - less than an average of four per day.\n\nThe retired officer, a former fighter pilot, criticized the choice of weapons, stating, \"For example, blowing an antenna off the top of buildings. Hit the building with a 2,000-pounder, not cruise missiles.\" He also called for many more sorties.\n\nAt a Pentagon briefing Tuesday, Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, explained the strategy behind the missile attack on the communication suite atop an Islamic State finance center in Raqqa, Syria, the terrorist group's headquarters. However, the aftermath of the attack showed that the surrounding structure remained largely untouched.\n\nEarly Wednesday, U.S. Central Command announced a reduction in the tempo of the airstrikes, conducting a few hits in Iraq and one in Syria. However, later in the day, U.S. fighter jets and aircraft belonging to two Arab partner nations began dropping missiles on Islamic State-controlled oil refineries in eastern Syria.\n\nThe targets chosen by Central Command have not been primarily aimed at degrading the Islamic State inside Iraq, but rather at preventing the terrorist group from moving in one direction or another, or to break its hold on particular locations such as dams or small towns. The air war continues without American combat troops on the ground to uproot Islamic State positions. Iraqis have shown little ability to carry out such missions or to spot targets for U.S. warplanes.\n\nArmy Gen. Lloyd Austin, Central Command chief, had initially wanted to put U.S. spotters on the ground, but Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, Joint Chiefs chairman, convinced him that other tactics could be used. Mr. Obama has decreed \"no boots on the ground.\"\n\nUnder the current setup, joint command centers radio the positions of the enemy to Iraqis and U.S. pilots based on video feeds from unmanned aircraft and other intelligence assets. However, a retired military officer who visits Baghdad routinely and works with Iraqi defense officials stated, \"That is a recipe for disaster once we get into close-in combat.\"\n\nThe former officer explained the mission gap, stating that ground spotters need a critical piece of equipment: a multiband radio that connects them to other combatants and to pilots overhead. Conventional forces also have no specialized units set up to spot targets. This capability resides with Iraqi special operations forces, but they have limited experience, the former officer said.\n\nThis role is not as important while U.S. pilots target Islamic State fighters in relatively open terrain, but it becomes crucial if the reorganized Iraqi units begin to fight in close combat in congested areas where pilots need exact locations. Retired Army Maj. Gen. Robert Scales stated, \"I'd like to see more of everything, a real air campaign with sorties delivered against the ISIS leadership.\"\n\nWithout more intensive strikes, he warned, \"Over time the enemy learns to obviate the killing effects and becomes used to seeing planes orbiting overhead.\" The Pentagon said the air campaign could go on for years. The Iraqi army has shown itself unable, or unwilling, to stand up to the Islamic State. The country's special operations arm, also referred to as counterterrorism units, are more proficient. They fought alongside Kurdish peshmerga fighters to take back the huge hydroelectric dam near Mosul, with cover from U.S. airstrikes.",
    " Title: Trump Contemplates Regulating Domestic Flights Amidst Coronavirus Outbreak, Maintains Opposition to National Stay-at-Home Order\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that his administration is considering ordering airlines to reduce domestic flights, particularly those traveling between cities currently battling the pandemic. However, Trump has yet to issue a national stay-at-home order, stating that it is not necessary in certain states.\n\nGovernors in several states have taken independent action in the travel sector. For instance, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has mandated self-isolation for 14 days for anyone flying to Florida from New York, New Jersey, or Connecticut, states that have been heavily impacted by the coronavirus. Alaska and Hawaii have also implemented self-quarantine requirements for travelers arriving from other states.\n\nPresident Trump expressed concerns about flights serving as a means of transporting the virus from one hotspot to another. \"You have them going, in some cases, from hot spot to hot spot,\" Trump said during his daily briefing on the crisis. He acknowledged the potential hardship such restrictions would impose on the airlines.\n\nAirlines, industry officials, and health experts argue that flights are an essential service, necessary for both people and cargo, and should continue during the crisis. The federal government reinforced this view with a key provision in the $2 trillion coronavirus aid package passed last week: airlines that accept a portion of the $50 billion set aside for the industry must maintain a minimum level of service through at least September.\n\nWhen asked on Monday about the continued operation of airports and flights despite the coronavirus outbreak, Trump stated, \"We are going to be \u2013 hopefully before we close things \u2013 we\u2019re going to start to open things.\" He added, \"Airports, when you close them and reopen them, it\u2019s a tremendous deal. It\u2019s a tremendous deal. In addition, you need them for emergencies, you have emergency flights.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would be the agency responsible for ordering any shutdown or restrictions, as demonstrated by their actions last year when the Boeing 737 Max was grounded following two fatal crashes in less than five months. When asked about the possibility of grounding flights nationwide, the FAA responded with a statement: \"The FAA does not comment on rumors.\"\n\nAirlines have significantly reduced their flight schedules in response to the dramatic decrease in passenger volume between cities. President Trump has also imposed a ban on foreign nationals visiting the U.S. from China and most of Europe, including France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. He has also implemented restrictions on non-essential travel from Mexico and Canada.\n\nDespite the ongoing pandemic, Trump maintains that a national stay-at-home order is not necessary because \"you have to give a little bit of flexibility\" in states or regions where the coronavirus has not been as prevalent. He cited the Midwest and Alaska as examples.",
    " Title: Concerns Mount Over HealthCare.gov's Performance and Insurance Plan Availability as Enrollment Deadline Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the enrollment deadline for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) approaches, administration officials are expressing concerns about the potential negative publicity surrounding high insurance plan prices and limited choices on the HealthCare.gov website. According to internal documents obtained by CNN, project managers are worried that as people begin to select plans on a more functional Obamacare site, the media attention will focus on individual plan selections and choices, potentially revealing fewer options than desired to promote consumer choice and a positive shopping experience.\n\nThe documents, known as War Room Notes dated Oct. 28, also suggest that in some cases, there will be relatively high-cost plans. This discussion appears to reference an earlier report by CNN that the Affordable Care Act has failed to lower prices for people in rural areas. The Times reported that in more than 500 counties, only one insurer is participating in the new online insurance exchanges, leaving residents with limited options.\n\nThe War Room notes also mention \"problem plans\" and a site issue that prevents certification, possibly due to a spelling error on the website, according to CNN. The high cost of coverage under the new law has already been a point of contention, with a Manhattan Institute analysis showing that, on average, Obamacare will increase underlying premiums by 41 percent in most states, according to Forbes.\n\nBefore the law's online healthcare markets launched on Oct. 1, the administration estimated nearly 500,000 people would enroll for subsidized private insurance within the first month. However, a computer system plagued by issues has prevented most from doing so.\n\nRecently, at least 3.5 million Americans have received cancellation notices from their private carriers because their coverage does not meet the standards set by the Affordable Care Act. The exact number is unclear, as data from half the states is still unavailable, according to an Associated Press survey.\n\nThe administration has refused to release official Obamacare insurance plan enrollment numbers until mid-November, when a crash effort of computer fixes may be showing results. However, numbers are expected to be disappointingly low. Americans remain divided over the new healthcare law, with negative views outweighing positives. Yet, they also lean against repealing it.",
    " Title: Romney Campaign Raises $4.2 Million Following Obama Tax Ruling, Obama Campaign Responds\n\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court's ruling on the Obama Tax case, Mitt Romney's campaign has reported a significant influx of funds, totaling $4.2 million in the past 24 hours. The surge in donations comes as President Obama sent out an email expressing his anticipation of being outspent in his re-election campaign.\n\nIn response to the ruling, Romney has stated that he would repeal the entire bill on his first day in office should he be elected president. The influx of funds follows President Obama's statement that he may become the first president in modern history to be outspent in his re-election campaign.\n\nThe Obama campaign's fundraising efforts are not just being challenged by super PACs and anonymous outside groups, but also by the Romney campaign itself. According to the Obama campaign, the Romney campaign has raised more than three-quarters of its funds from individuals giving $1,000 or more, while the Obama campaign raised almost three-quarters of its funds from donors giving less than $1,000 during the primaries.\n\nPresident Obama's email also highlighted the additional billion dollars in spending by super PACs and front groups on ads criticizing his campaign and policies. He emphasized that while the campaign can be outspent and still win, it cannot be outspent 10 to 1 and still win.\n\nThe Obama campaign has received support from more than 2.2 million Americans and expressed gratitude for their contributions. As the fundraising deadline for this week approaches, the campaign is encouraging donations of $3 or more. Donations made today will automatically enter donors to join Michelle and Obama for one of the last grassroots dinners of the campaign, with today being the last chance to get a name in.\n\nThe Obama campaign contrasted their approach to fundraising with Romney's, stating that Romney spent the past weekend at a secretive retreat for the biggest donors to both his campaign and the super PACs that support him. The Obama campaign's grassroots dinners, on the other hand, represent a different approach to campaigning.",
    " Title: Obama's Farewell Address: A Call for Continued Action and National Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his farewell address to the nation Tuesday night, President Barack Obama called for continued action, unity, and a renewed commitment to democracy. In a speech that touched on the challenges facing the nation, Obama urged Americans to stay engaged, emphasizing the importance of citizenship and the responsibility that comes with it.\n\nObama's call for action may be of particular significance, as he signaled a return to his roots as a community organizer. However, his post-presidency promises to be more than just a return to activism. With the surprise election of Donald Trump, who intends to dismantle much of Obama's legacy, the former president has shown a renewed energy and determination.\n\nWhile Obama has pledged to honor the tradition of former presidents in refraining from critiquing his successor publicly, he has also hinted at a willingness to speak out if he perceives a threat to core American values. The recent report suggesting a potential crisis, with Russia allegedly possessing damaging personal information about President-elect Trump, may be a case in point.\n\nObama's post-presidency appears to follow multiple strands. He is doubling down on his commitment to Organizing for America, the outside group that sprang from his presidential campaigns and focused on supporting his agenda while he was in office. Now, the group is being retooled to train activists and recruit Democratic candidates.\n\nAnother post-presidential goal for Obama is the reshaping of congressional districts, due after the 2020 census. \"When Congress is dysfunctional, we should draw our districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes,\" Obama said.\n\nObama will work on redistricting with former Attorney General Eric Holder, who chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. The group will invest in races for governor, state legislature, and other down-ballot offices.\n\nUnspoken in Obama's remarks is the decline of the Democratic Party during his tenure. The party has lost roughly 1,000 state legislative seats, control of both houses of Congress, numerous governorships, and now the presidency. Democrats control the governor's chair and both legislative chambers in only six states.\n\nLike most ex-presidents in the modern era, Obama will set about writing a memoir as soon as he leaves office. His initiative aimed at helping young men of color avoid the school-to-prison pipeline, known as My Brother's Keeper, will be another focus, as will his Chicago-based presidential library and foundation.\n\nObama will be based in Washington for the next two and a half years, while his younger daughter finishes high school, making him the first president since Woodrow Wilson to remain in the capital after leaving office. Obama's close proximity to his successor \u2013 he and his family have rented a house less than three miles from the White House \u2013 will only tempt involvement as an informal Democratic adviser.\n\nPolitical scientist Andra Gillespie of Emory University in Atlanta suggests that Obama may maintain a significant behind-the-scenes role in helping craft Democratic strategy. However, in his remarks Tuesday night, Obama framed his exhortations on civic engagement in a broad, nonpartisan way.\n\n\"Our youth, our drive, our diversity and openness, our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours,\" Obama said. \"But that potential will only be realized if our democracy works. Only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people. Only if all of us, regardless of party affiliation or particular interests, help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now.\"\n\nIn his call for national unity, Obama adopted a hopeful tone, urging Americans to reengage in the hard work of forming a more perfect union. \"If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself,\" he said to the cheers of the crowd at Chicago's McCormick Place.\n\n\"Sometimes you'll win, sometimes you'll lose. Presuming a reservoir in goodness, that can be a risk,\" Obama continued. \"And there will be times when the process will disappoint you. But for those of us fortunate enough to have been part of this one and to see it up close, let me tell you, it can energize and inspire. And more often than not, your faith in America and in Americans will be confirmed.\"",
    " Title: Economic Performance During Obama's Presidency: A Closer Look at the Numbers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe strong economic growth in the second quarter of 2014 has sparked discussions about why President Obama is not receiving more credit for the economic recovery. However, a closer examination of the data suggests that the evidence of a robust and sustained recovery is still lacking.\n\nWhile the economy grew 4.6 percent in the past quarter, it is important to remember that \"a single swallow does not make a summer.\" One strong quarter does not necessarily indicate a healthy economy. In fact, only one other quarter during Obama's presidency has matched this growth rate. Conversely, the economy's performance in 2014's first quarter was qualitatively as bad as the second quarter was good, marking the economy's worst performance since 2009's first quarter and the worst quarter since 1990.\n\nThe Obama administration's economic performance has been characterized by a preponderance of subpar growth. In 10 out of 22 quarters, the economy's growth has been below 2 percent. Excluding the negative 2.8 percent real GDP downturn in 2009, Mr. Obama's 2010-13 average annual GDP growth was just slightly above 2.1 percent. Including 2009's figure, the president's five-year average falls to below 1.2 percent annual GDP growth. If the Congressional Budget Office's 1.5 percent estimate for 2014 economic growth holds true, Mr. Obama's six-year economic growth average will be a paltry 1.2 percent.\n\nIn terms of unemployment, Mr. Obama's record has been little better. Despite a drop in labor-force participation that has helped lower the rate, the percentage of unemployed has remained high. Last month's 5.9 percent unemployment rate was the lowest of Mr. Obama's presidency, and it was the first time it has been below 6.1 percent since he came into office. In contrast, for 30 consecutive months of his presidency, the U.S. unemployment rate was 9 percent or higher. The average annual unemployment rate for Mr. Obama's first five years in office was 6.9 percent, a level not seen since 1993.\n\nThe economy has not lacked substantial assistance, with the Federal Reserve's unprecedented monetary-policy accommodation and an equally \"stimulative\" fiscal policy. Federal debt held by the public more than doubled during Obama's time in office, growing 106 percent, while the overall economy has grown just 12.6 percent.\n\nSupporters argue that Mr. Obama faced a recession when he came into office and that, relative to the blow, the economy has at least endured. However, from an economic perspective, the greater the blow, the stronger the recovery should be, too. Such has not been the case.\n\nThe president's problem with the economy runs deeper than just economics. It is rooted in politics for two important reasons. First, Mr. Obama is now firmly associated with the subpar economy of the past five years. Given that America has suffered a prolonged and painful economic performance for more than six years, it is natural to associate the president with it. It is a test of most people's memory\u2014if not credulity itself\u2014to try attaching today's economy to George W. Bush, who is out of office for almost six years.\n\nSecond, America is not accustomed to persistent failure. Americans expect excellence, particularly in the economy. Given his record, what is truly surprising is not that the president does not receive credit for a good economy, but that he does not receive more blame for the economy being so poor. If anything, Mr. Obama should be counting his blessings for the little respect he has earned for his economy's dismal performance.\n\nJ.T.

    " Title: Second-Term Challenges and Achievements: A Comparative Analysis of Presidential Legacies in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the second term of a president often presents unique challenges and opportunities. This is no different for President Barack Obama, who has faced criticism for being too passive, a claim that his advisor, David Plouffe, dismisses as simplistic.\n\nPresidential second terms have historically been marked by significant events, both positive and negative. For instance, Ronald Reagan faced the Iran-contra affair, while Bill Clinton was impeached. President Obama, like his predecessors, has also encountered setbacks, such as his failed attempt to pass gun control legislation early in his second term. Similarly, President George W. Bush's fifth-year initiative to reform Social Security met with resistance, and the escalating violence in Iraq made it difficult for him to regain momentum.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that presidents have managed to make significant strides in their second terms despite Congressional investigations. Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the Soviet Union, Clinton balanced the federal budget, and Bush, in the face of broad opposition, implemented a troop surge in Iraq, contributing to a turnaround in the situation.\n\nPresident Obama, too, may find that the health of the economy at the end of his term could have a more significant impact on his legacy than the setbacks he currently faces. The recent announcement by the Congressional Budget Office of a sharp drop in the projected deficit serves as a reminder of this potential.\n\nYet, the current furors could reinforce the impression that the Obama presidency has expanded the role of government more than many Americans are comfortable with. These controversies can also undermine the president's ability to focus public attention, a powerful tool of the presidency.\n\nAs a senator, Obama recognized the dynamic nature of the presidency, understanding that a president could drive only 15 to 20 percent of the public agenda, with the rest requiring a reactive approach. In this light, Obama's famed equanimity and his ability to take a longer view are attributed to his experience in office.\n\n\"Being in office for nearly four and a half years gives the president some perspective\u2014it helps separate the signal from the noise,\" said Dan Pfeiffer, a White House senior adviser. \"When you have dealt with real life-and-death problems, the political ones seem much smaller and affect you less.\"",
    " Title: Controversy Surrounding Fast and Furious Operation Intensifies as Terry Family Accuses Attorney General Holder of Hiding Information\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Terry family, parents of slain U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, have accused Attorney General Eric Holder and other Justice Department officials of withholding information regarding the botched anti-gunrunning operation Fast and Furious. In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday, the Terry family expressed their belief that the Obama administration is concealing details about the operation that led to their son's death in December 2010.\n\nThe Fast and Furious operation, which allowed illicit guns to \"walk\" in the hope of tracking them to larger traffickers, has been under scrutiny since two of the guns used in the operation were found at the crime scene where Terry was killed. A House panel voted Wednesday along party lines to recommend holding Holder in contempt of Congress for not handing over a trove of documents related to Fast and Furious. President Obama has asserted executive privilege in keeping many of the documents out of public view.\n\nThe full House would still need to approve the resolution in order for Holder to be formally held in contempt of Congress. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) suggested that the vote can be avoided if the attorney general turns over more emails and memos about the Fast and Furious sting. Holder has testified that he only found out about Fast and Furious after Terry's death, and he has condemned the tactics used in the operation.\n\nHowever, GOP lawmakers have suggested that top officials at the Justice Department knew more about the operation than they have admitted. The Terry family, in their interview with Hannity, expressed their frustration at the Obama administration's perceived efforts to prevent them from learning the full story about their son's death.\n\n\"They're lying... They're passing the buck,\" said Kent Terry, Brian Terry's father. \"I just know that they're hiding something big. Something happened out there.\"\n\nThe Terry family's statement comes a day after they released a statement expressing their disappointment with the Obama administration's latest actions. \"Attorney General Eric Holder's refusal to fully disclose the documents associated with Operation Fast and Furious and President Obama's assertion of executive privilege serves to compound this tragedy. It denies the Terry family and the American people the truth,\" they said.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Fast and Furious has raised constitutional questions and challenges about the power of the presidency. The immediate question was whether the documents contained information so damaging that the president was willing to risk bad PR by moving to lock them down. GOP lawmakers also questioned whether Obama's assertion was legitimate, later voting in committee that it was not appropriate in this case.\n\nThe Department of Justice has defended its response, with Holder stating that Issa rejected what he thought was \"an extraordinary offer.\" Wednesday's developments follow a flurry of activity Tuesday, as Holder tried to negotiate a way to avert the contempt proceedings. Issa had earlier indicated a willingness to postpone the vote after Holder indicated a willingness to make compromises and supply some documents in response to House Republicans' subpoena.",
    " Title: White House Proposes 5% Domestic Spending Cuts in 2020 Budget, Maintains Border Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at reducing the federal budget deficit, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow announced on Sunday that President Trump has proposed a 5 percent across-the-board cut on all domestic spending as part of his 2020 budget. The announcement was made during an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n\"It will be a tough budget,\" Kudlow said. \"We're going to do our own caps this year, and I think it's long overdue.\" Kudlow added that the recent budget deals have not been favorable towards spending, and this proposed reduction is the \"exact right prescription.\"\n\nThe proposed budget comes as a Government Accountability Office report predicts the U.S. budget deficit to hit $897 billion. Kudlow, however, stated that there's no reason to \"obsess\" about the budget deficit as long as it remains below 5 percent of the overall economy.\n\nLike previous spending blueprints, Trump's plan for the 2020 budget year will propose cuts to many domestic programs favored by lawmakers in both parties but leave alone politically popular retirement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThe budget proposal is expected to face months of negotiations in Washington, as lawmakers grapple with erasing the last remnants of a failed 2011 budget deal that would otherwise cut core Pentagon operations by $71 billion and domestic agencies and foreign aid by $55 billion.\n\nTrump's 2017 tax cut and sharp increases in spending for both the Pentagon and domestic agencies, as well as the growing federal retirement costs of the baby boom generation, are major contributors to the growing deficit. Promises that the tax cut would stimulate so much economic growth that it would mostly pay for itself have been proven wrong.\n\nThe 2020 proposal will also maintain the 3 percent tax cuts implemented in 2018, according to Kudlow. One area that won't see a cut in the proposed budget is for funding for the president's border wall.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Sunday that Trump will request at least $8.6 billion in new funding to build additional sections of a wall along the Mexico border. Trump also wants $5 billion in additional funds for the Department of Homeland Security and another $3.6 billion in military construction funds.\n\nAll this would come in addition to the $6.5 billion Trump vowed last month to redirect for the construction of the wall. \"The whole issue of the wall and border security is a paramount of importance,\" Kudlow said on Sunday. \"We have a crisis down there. I think the president has made that case effectively. It's a crisis of economics, it's a crisis of crime and drugs, it's a crisis of just of humanity.\"",

Graham suggested that Trump should not accept Putin's denial of involvement in the election and instead, should confront him about the ongoing attempts to disrupt the 2018 election cycle.\n\nGraham also addressed the issue of Russian influence in Turkey, acknowledging it as problematic but viewing it as a new chapter following the re-election of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan amid sweeping government purges.\n\nOn the international front, Graham attributed North Korea's criticisms of U.S. rhetoric to Chinese influence, stating, \"I see China's hands all over this.\" He added that the U.S. should not let China use North Korea to back off from the ongoing trade dispute.\n\nDomestically, Graham expressed optimism about the four Supreme Court nominees President Trump is reportedly considering, stating, \"Republicans are holding four lottery tickets, and they're all winners.\" The nominees under consideration are federal judges Thomas Hardiman, Brett Kavanaugh, Raymond Kethledge, and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nGraham particularly praised Thomas Hardiman, comparing him favorably to Associate Justice Samuel Alito in terms of personality and legal bent. However, he criticized the partisanship in the Senate, stating that even a conservative nominee would struggle to secure many Democratic votes.\n\nGraham also suggested that the nomination process could be a \"nightmare for red-state Democrats,\" who risk alienating their constituency if they oppose Trump's pick. The increasingly partisan nature of Supreme Court confirmation hearings has led some analysts to urge Trump to try to defuse the tension. Juan Williams, a Fox News political analyst, noted the potential for a conservative justice to be appointed, which could be perceived as the court becoming a \"rubber stamp for a conservative social agenda.\"\n\nThe article concludes with Trump's scheduled announcement of his pick to replace retiring Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy in a primetime address at 9 p.m. ET.",
    " Title: Colorado Lawmakers Discuss Allowing Voters to Change Ballots in Future Presidential Primaries\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the state of Colorado, voters who have already cast their ballots for presidential candidates who have since dropped out cannot redo their ballots this year, but lawmakers are discussing whether this should be an option in future presidential primaries.\n\nElections officials have been encouraging voters to turn in their Super Tuesday mail ballots early to have results available earlier in the state's first presidential primary in 20 years. However, this means that some voters selected candidates who are no longer in the race, such as Pete Buttigieg.\n\nSecretary of State Jena Griswold noted on Sunday via social media that Colorado voters who have filled out ballots but have not turned them in can still obtain new ballots or cross out their previous selection and pick a new candidate by 7 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Alec Garnett told reporters on Monday morning that there should be a discussion about a possible statutory change to allow voters in the future to make their voices heard through Election Day.\n\n\"Every voter should have the opportunity, even if their vote was cast for a candidate who has dropped out, to go to the county clerk and have the opportunity to pull a provisional ballot and vote for who remains in the race,\" Garnett said.\n\nGarnett added that this is an issue that lawmakers did not discuss during the bill's process, and it is something that they should be talking about with both sides of the aisle.\n\nBoulder County Clerk Molly Fitzpatrick also tweeted on Monday that voters who still have their ballots can change their vote by following the voter instructions on how to correct a mistake. However, if a voter has already voted, they cannot be issued a replacement ballot.\n\nOnly three other states hold all mail-ballot statewide elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, making the issue of voting early for a candidate that may drop out early fairly unique.\n\nGarnett said he has not spoken to lawmakers about specific solutions, but after the results came in from South Carolina's caucus and former mayor Buttigieg's announcement on Sunday, he has heard from constituents asking what they can do.\n\n\"I think it was a little frustrating on my end to say, 'There's nothing you can do,'\" he said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Steve Fenberg also said he has heard from people who are frustrated by being unable to change their votes, and he thinks this is an issue lawmakers can tackle this year for future elections, though he doesn't yet know what the exact solution should be.\n\n\"It could be logistically difficult, but I think it's worth looking into,\" Fenberg said.\n\nThe problem is exacerbated by the fact that the primary election for presidential candidates is how the state parties select delegates, and some of the candidates who dropped out, such as Buttigieg, could still receive delegates because they had a significant amount of support.",
    " Title: Michael Cohen Admits to Hiring IT Firm to Manipulate Polls for Trump Campaign, Owes Money\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bombshell report by The Wall Street Journal, it has been revealed that Michael Cohen, former personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, hired an IT firm to manipulate polls in favor of Trump during his presidential campaign in 2015. Cohen reportedly owes a significant amount of the money he owed the firm, RedFinch Solutions LLC, for their services.\n\nCohen confirmed the revelations on Twitter Thursday, stating, \"As for the @WSJ article on poll rigging, what I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn\u2019t deserve it.\"\n\nAccording to the report, John Gauger, owner of RedFinch Solutions LLC, went to Trump Tower in 2015 to collect the $50,000 that Cohen had promised for trying to influence the polls in Trump's favor. However, Gauger received a blue Walmart bag containing approximately $12,000 to $13,000 in cash and a boxing glove, instead of the promised check.\n\nCohen denied to The Wall Street Journal that he paid in cash, stating that the money was given by check. The report also states that Gauger was asked in 2014 to manipulate the results of a CNBC poll for the top U.S. business leaders, but he was unsuccessful in getting Trump into the top 100. The following year, he was asked to influence a Drudge Report ranking of potential Republican primary picks, where Trump came in fifth.\n\nGauger told the newspaper that he performed other services for Cohen, unrelated to the president, and said Cohen paid for some of them. One project was to create the \u201c@WomenForCohen\u201d account, which still exists on Twitter. Its bio describes Cohen as \"strong, pit bull, sex symbol, no nonsense, business-oriented, and ready to make a difference!\"\n\nIn 2017, Cohen requested a $50,000 reimbursement for \"tech services\" from the Trump Tower Organization, according to federal prosecutors in a charging document filed in August 2018. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, bank fraud, and lying to Congress. None of the charges are connected to his dealings with RedFinch.\n\nThe Trump Organization did not give a comment to The Wall Street Journal, but Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, told the newspaper that Cohen is a thief. \"If one thing has been established, it's that Michael Cohen is completely untrustworthy,\" the former New York City mayor said.",
    " Title: Pelosi Contemplates Delaying Transmission of Impeachment Articles to Senate as Calls for Fairer Trial Mount\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is reportedly considering withholding the transmission of the articles of impeachment to the Senate, following the House's passage of the impeachment articles against President Donald Trump on Wednesday. This decision comes as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has declared his intention to coordinate trial strategy with the White House, raising concerns among some legal scholars and Democrats about a fair trial.\n\nThe idea of delaying the transmission of the articles gained momentum in recent days, as McConnell has made it clear he has little interest in serving as an impartial overseer of the Senate trial. Constitutional lawyer Laurence Tribe, in an op-ed, called on Democrats to delay sending the impeachment articles to the Senate until McConnell agrees to run a fairer process.\n\nDuring a press conference, Pelosi's remarks about the impeachment process were unexpected, prompting a flurry of questions from reporters. When asked if she would not transmit the articles, Pelosi responded, \"You're asking me, 'So are we all going to go out and play in the snow?' That has not been part of our conversations.\"\n\nFollowing the press conference, Pelosi huddled with top committee chairs leading Trump-focused investigations, and they emerged with a consistent message: The only story that matters is the president has been impeached.\n\nSome Democrats believe a delay in transmitting articles is under consideration, as House leaders decided against naming impeachment managers \u2013 the set of lawmakers who would argue their case on the Senate floor \u2013 until an undetermined later date. In the past, House leaders have identified their impeachment managers the same day, but Pelosi will now be empowered to pick managers at her discretion and without a deadline.\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) has approached every member of House leadership about the idea and received responses ranging from interest to outright support. Blumenauer argued that the delay could allow the House to continue building on its evidence for impeachment and potentially score additional legal victories that could unlock troves of new evidence and witness testimony the Trump administration has withheld from Congress.\n\nEarly discussions about the timing of transmitting articles of impeachment to the Senate are \"not in the context\" of Tribe's proposal, according to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. However, he acknowledged that colleagues have been discussing the idea.\n\nAs the impeachment process unfolds, it remains to be seen whether Pelosi will delay the transmission of the articles to the Senate and what impact this decision might have on the impeachment trial.",
    " Title: \"Obamacare in the Spotlight: A Political Test in New Hampshire's Midterm Elections\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming midterm elections on November 4, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is set to play a significant role in several key races, particularly in New Hampshire. The state, which is closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, is one of about 10 states where Republicans hope to make gains in order to take control of the Senate.\n\nSenators Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, along with Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, are among the Democratic targets of anti-Obamacare ads by conservative groups. The law, aimed at expanding health insurance coverage to millions more Americans, has come under sustained attack from Republicans.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has urged Democrats campaigning in the midterm elections not to shy away from \"Obamacare,\" but instead to \"forcefully defend\" it. Obama has stated that a surge in enrollment shows the system is running smoothly now, after its disastrous debut last October.\n\nIn the New Hampshire Senate race, Shaheen's leading Republican opponent, Scott Brown, is betting that the healthcare issue will resonate in New Hampshire, where the state's famous motto is \"Live Free or Die.\" Brown, a former senator from neighboring Massachusetts, says the act should be completely repealed and the issue of healthcare reform should be left to the states.\n\nWhile Obamacare may now be working better, national polls clearly show more people disapprove than approve of the law. In New Hampshire, a recent WMUR-Granite State poll reported that 51 percent of adults oppose Obamacare, while just 37 percent support it. Sixty-one percent of the state's voters think medical costs will increase under the act.\n\nDerek Gagnon, a 33-year-old auto mechanic, is one of the skeptics. He has no health insurance and has no intention of signing up for the private insurance offered through the government-run website, HealthCare.gov. Gagnon's distaste for the individual mandate dovetails with a principal line of conservative attacks nationally on the law.\n\nIn the race for New Hampshire's other Senate seat, incumbent Senator Jeanne Shaheen still has political capital in the state, and political analyst Dean Spiliotes doubts the healthcare issue alone could defeat her. However, the healthcare issue is a significant factor in the race, and the outcome could be influenced by how effectively each candidate addresses the concerns of voters about Obamacare.\n\nIn the House of Representatives race, Representative Carol Shea-Porter, a fellow Democrat, and Ann Kuster, the state's other Democratic Representative, were among the earliest advocates of the healthcare law. Enrollment in Obamacare in the state of 1.3 million people has reached 40,000, double the number that had been expected.\n\nIn one hopeful sign for Democrats, enrollment in Obamacare in the state has reached 40,000 - double the number that had been expected. Shea-Porter, a former social worker who came to Congress in 2006 campaigning on healthcare reform, said she would never run away from Obamacare because she considers the law to be a \"great joy and triumph.\" However, she understands the political perils for Democrats of Obamacare. She lost her seat in Congress in 2010 elections after her vote for the law, only to be re-elected in 2012. Her 2014 race is considered a toss-up although her Republican opponent has yet to be chosen in a September primary.\n\nIn conclusion, the midterm elections in New Hampshire will serve as a test of whether Democrats can overcome voter skepticism about Obamacare and use the law as a draw rather than a liability. The outcome of the elections could have significant implications for the future of the Affordable Care Act and the balance of power in Congress.",
    " Title: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman Resigns Amid Allegations of Domestic Abuse\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a swift turn of events, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a prominent figure in the #Resistance movement and a vocal critic of President Trump, has resigned following allegations of physical and emotional abuse by four women. The New Yorker published an article on Monday detailing the graphic accusations, which include choking, threats, and demeaning language.\n\nSchneiderman, who had built a high-profile reputation during the Trump era for his legal pushback and criticism of the President's agenda, was hailed as an icon of the anti-Trump left. He also became a key figure in the #MeToo movement, taking legal action against Harvey Weinstein and advocating for a \"critical national reckoning\" about the harassment of women.\n\nHowever, the article revealed that Schneiderman had allegedly abused four women, including choking a former girlfriend, controlling what she ate, and demanding that another girlfriend, who was born in Sri Lanka and whom Schneiderman referred to as his \"brown slave,\" call him \"Master.\"\n\nMichelle Manning Barish, one of the women speaking out, told The New Yorker, \"You can't be a champion of women when you are hitting them and choking them in bed, and saying to them, 'You're a f--king whore.'\" Tanya Selvaratnam, another woman, said, \"He needs to be called out.\"\n\nSchneiderman responded to the allegations, stating, \"In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity. I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.\"\n\nWithin three hours of the article being published, Schneiderman announced his resignation, effective at the end of Tuesday. The accusations brought a wave of condemnation from both the right and the left, with fellow New York Democrat Andrew Cuomo calling the pattern of facts and corroboration \"damning\" and calling for Schneiderman to resign.\n\nTrump allies, whom Schneiderman had targeted, made little attempt to hide their glee at their foe's sudden downfall. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway tweeted, \"Gotcha,\" referencing a tweet of Schneiderman's in which he said that \"no one is above the law.\" Donald Trump Jr. dug up past statements Schneiderman had made about the #MeToo movement, snarking, \"Self awareness level 0.\"\n\nIn a November interview with Full Frontal's Samantha Bee, Schneiderman laid out his achievements in the Trump era, boasting about his legal victories against the President. Now, Samantha Bee's \"Full Frontal\" has tweeted a screenshot of Schneiderman boasting on Twitter of the superhero mockups the TBS show had made for his November appearance.",
    " Title: Obamacare Repairs: A Delicate Balance Amidst Political and Actuarial Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Washington, D.C., a flurry of activity is underway as lawmakers grapple with the intricacies of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. On Thursday, President Obama proposed a fix, followed by the House's approval of a separate solution on Friday, with more ideas emerging from various corners. However, these well-intentioned repairs could potentially exacerbate the issues plaguing Obamacare.\n\nThe primary aim of these proposed changes is to allow millions of Americans, whose health insurance plans are being canceled under Obamacare, to retain their existing policies and doctors, as originally promised. According to an Associated Press survey, over 4.2 million Americans have received cancellation notices from their insurers. This group, healthier on average compared to the uninsured, is causing concern due to the potential actuarial implications.\n\nIf healthier individuals remain outside the Obamacare pool, the system could face actuarial trouble, much like removing a piston from an engine and expecting it to run smoothly. The fear is that the Obamacare exchanges could attract a disproportionate share of higher-cost, sicker individuals, leading to higher premiums and a potential inability for the system to sustain itself.\n\nInsurers and state insurance commissioners express reservations about reversing course, with some arguing that bringing back canceled policies could violate new state laws that forbid \"substandard\" plans. California and New York, two prominent states, are among those with such laws in place.\n\nA reversal could exacerbate the confusion and lack of confidence already surrounding Obamacare. A crisis of confidence in the new health-care system could be debilitating, as noted by Larry Kocot, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who helped roll out Medicare Part D during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nThe political pressure to address the cancellations is significant, with the backlash reaching \"Category 5 political hurricane\" intensity, as described by Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR). The drop in President Obama's approval rating to 39% and the personal stories of those affected by the cancellations have put immense pressure on lawmakers, particularly Democrats who are up for re-election in 2014.\n\nThe political landscape is further complicated by the fact that most Democrats dislike the current House-approved bill, with President Obama promising to veto it due to concerns about enlarging the pool of people who could be attracted to the plans and worsening the outlook for Obamacare's sustainability.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen where this will lead. The rollout of Obamacare has revealed problems beyond a broken website, and fixing them could result in a delicate unraveling of the system.",
    " Title: AllSides Report Suggests Google News Shows Bias Toward Left-Leaning Perspectives\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report from media technology group AllSides has suggested that Google News and Google Search results show a strong preference for media outlets with a left-leaning perspective in the United States political spectrum. The report, which reviewed Google News' homepage and search engine results over a two-week period, found that the overall bias of Google News was about 65 percent toward the left, with about 20 percent toward the center and about 16 percent to the right.\n\nThe timeframe of the study coincided with President Donald Trump's tweets criticizing Google for allegedly biasing its search results in his favor. In late August, Trump tweeted, \"Google search results for 'Trump News' shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media... Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good.\"\n\nThe report found that left-leaning news was almost always one of the top two results displayed, with news from the center of the political spectrum less visible but usually in the top five or six results. News from the political right was often found further down the page, with users having to scroll down before seeing their first news article from the right.\n\nThe report also found that when news from the left competed with news from other viewpoints, the left won just about every time. In 91 percent of cases where there was bias of one political slant over another, the left won over the right. When the competition was between the center and the left, the left's dominance was still strong at 80 percent.\n\nThe report did not suggest that Google intentionally favored media sources from the left, but rather that the resulting choice of links provided by Google News showed a significant bias in favor of the left. The report attributed this bias to the fact that most news outlets and journalists have political views that represent the left side of the US political spectrum, and that online news consumers are younger and lean farther left than the average American.\n\nGoogle has previously denied setting a political agenda and stated that its goal is to provide the most relevant answers to users in a matter of seconds. The company has not yet responded to the AllSides report.\n\nThis study does not suggest that there is intentional favoritism for media sources from the left, nor does it suggest the opposite. It only demonstrates that the resulting choice of links that Google News provides do have a significant bias in favor of the left, according to the report.\n\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

    " Title: Indonesia Raises Minimum Marriage Age for Girls to 19, A Step Towards Ending Child Marriage\n\nArticle:\n\nIndonesia, the eighth-highest country in terms of child brides globally, has taken a significant step towards eradicating child marriage. This month, the country's parliament raised the minimum age at which girls can marry from 16 to 19. The decision was prompted by a Constitutional Court ruling in December that deemed it discriminatory to mandate a lower minimum age of marriage for girls than for boys.\n\nWhile this development is commendable, Indonesia is not the worst offender in this regard. According to UNICEF, 14% of Indonesian women marry before they reach 18 years old. In contrast, the figures are 59% in Bangladesh and 76% in Niger. Nineteen of the 20 countries where child marriage is most prevalent are in Africa.\n\nThe practice of marrying off daughters at a young age is often a means for families to secure their daughters' lives. Factors associated with this practice include rigid gender norms, conflict, and poverty. Education, particularly for girls, is a crucial factor. A study by the World Bank involving 15 countries found that girls without schooling are three times more likely to be married by age 18 than those with secondary education. However, in many cultures, education for girls takes a backseat to marriage and its associated duties.\n\nCutting a childhood short can have severe consequences. Girls who marry have an increased risk of sexual violence, poorer health, and higher school drop-out rates. They are also less likely to participate in the labor force, which incurs significant economic costs. A paper published in 2015 found that child marriage cost Indonesia's economy 1.7% of its GDP in 2014. The global welfare benefit of ending the practice is estimated to be around $22 billion.\n\nIndonesia's new policy is a significant stride towards ending child marriage. However, in the context of controversial new revisions to the country's criminal code\u2014which would criminalize extra-marital sex and endorse chauvinistic local by-laws\u2014lawmakers will need to demonstrate that the new marriage age for girls is more than a token gesture towards gender equality. Indonesia's parliament could resolve to tackle the social and economic forces that make child marriage so common. Ensuring that girls complete their 12 years of compulsory schooling would be a start. Reducing unintended pregnancies by improving access to contraception and sexual-health education would also help. Giving girls more control over their bodies would allow them to exercise more sway over their future, including who they marry. That is worth saying yes to.",
    " Title: U.S. Marshals Prepared to Guard National Monuments Amid Ongoing George Floyd Protests\n\nThe Trump administration has directed the U.S. Marshals Service to be on standby, ready to protect national monuments across the country amid ongoing protests following the death of George Floyd. In an email, Marshals Service Assistant Director Andrew C. Smith stated that the agency has been asked to immediately prepare to provide federal law enforcement support to safeguard national monuments.\n\nThe email, labeled as an \"Attorney General Assignment,\" suggests it originated from Attorney General William P. Barr. Smith noted that the assignment is challenging due to the wide range of potential targets for criminal activity.\n\nAccording to CNN, the Marshals are part of a \"major effort\" by the administration to bolster security around national monuments, with the Marshals expected to begin their work before the end of the week. The Daily Wire reported that unarmed National Guard troops will also be deployed in Washington, D.C., to assist the U.S. Park Police in protecting monuments in the nation's capital.\n\nThe security reinforcements were prompted after weeks of statues being toppled nationwide. Initially, rioters primarily targeted Confederate monuments, but in recent days, tributes to the founding fathers and even abolitionists have been destroyed.\n\nPresident Trump warned on Tuesday that those damaging federal property, such as monuments, would face prosecution under the full extent of the law. He tweeted, \"I have authorized the Federal Government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or other such Federal property in the U.S. with up to 10 years in prison, per the Veteran's Memorial Preservation Act, or such other laws that may be pertinent.\"\n\nHe added, \"This action is taken effective immediately, but may also be used retroactively for destruction or vandalism already caused. There will be no exceptions!\"\n\nThe president reiterated his stance on Wednesday night, tweeting, \"Very sad to see States allowing roving gangs of wise guys, anarchists & looters, many of them having no idea what they are doing, indiscriminately ripping down our statues and monuments to the past. Some are great works of art, but all represent our History & Heritage, both the good and the bad. It is important for us to understand and remember, even in turbulent and difficult times, and learn from them. Knowledge comes from the most unusual of places!\"",
    " Title: NSA's X-KEYSCORE Program: Unveiling a Vast Surveillance Tool for Foreign Signals Intelligence\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest revelation from Glenn Greenwald's disclosures from the Snowden files has shed light on a powerful surveillance program called X-KEYSCORE, operated by the National Security Agency (NSA). This program provides access to an extensive amount of internet data, potentially encompassing phone conversations, emails, chats, and more.\n\nThe quantity of data accessible through programs such as XKeyscore is immense. The XKeyscore system collects such a vast amount of internet data that it can only be stored for short periods, with content remaining on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for 30 days. One document explains that at some sites, the NSA receives 20+ terabytes of data per day, which can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.\n\nTo manage this data influx, the NSA has developed a multi-tiered system. Analysts can store \"interesting\" content in other databases, such as Pinwale, which can store material for up to five years. It's unclear exactly what's available through X-KEYSCORE, but it appears to be exclusively foreign signals intelligence.\n\nAn NSA tool called DNI Presenter, used to read the content of stored emails, also enables an analyst using XKeyscore to read the content of Facebook chats or private messages. Analysts can monitor Facebook chats by entering the Facebook user name and a date range into a simple search screen. They can search for internet browsing activities using a wide range of information, including search terms entered by the user or the websites viewed.\n\nThe XKeyscore program also allows an analyst to learn the IP addresses of every person who visits any website the analyst specifies. However, it's unclear whether this includes U.S. persons or only foreign nationals. Under U.S. law, the NSA is required to obtain an individualized Fisa warrant if the target of their surveillance is a 'U.S. person,' though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets.\n\nX-KEYSCORE seems to provide the technological capability, if not the legal authority, to target even U.S. persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant, provided that some identifying information, such as their email or IP address, is known to the analyst. The NSA documents assert that by 2008, 300 terrorists had been captured using intelligence from XKeyscore.\n\nWhile the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 requires an individualized warrant for the targeting of U.S. persons, NSA analysts are permitted to intercept the communications of such individuals without a warrant if they are in contact with one of the NSA's foreign targets. For instance, an XKeyscore document shows an NSA target in Tehran communicating with people in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and New York.\n\nGreenwald suggests that this validates Snowden's statement in an earlier interview that \"I, sitting at my desk, certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone, from you, or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President if I had a personal email.\" However, it's not clear at all whether X-KEYSCORE gives anyone \"authority\" to wiretap a U.S. citizen. Rather, it provides access to tremendous volumes of foreign communications, which can then be searched by NSA analysts.\n\nThere are known \"compliance problems\" with the NSA's surveillance programs, as communications by U.S. persons end up in this database if the other end of the conversation is overseas\u2014and these communications can therefore end up on an analyst's desktop. The NSA's minimization procedures are supposed to prevent such \"inadvertent\" targeting of U.S. persons, but as Greenwald reported earlier, there are plenty of exceptions to this rule.\n\nIn conclusion, the X-KEYSCORE program, as revealed by Glenn Greenwald, appears to be a powerful tool for foreign signals intelligence, potentially granting access to vast amounts of internet data, including phone conversations, emails, chats, and more. However, the legality and implications of its use in targeting U.S. persons remain a subject of debate and further investigation.",
    " Title: GOP Health Care Bill Faces Uncertain Future as Key Republicans Oppose Measure\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - The White House and congressional Republicans are in a precarious position as they struggle to garner enough votes to pass their health care bill. Several Republicans have publicly voiced their opposition to the current measure to repeal and replace Obamacare, bringing CNN's whip count to 21 Republicans - mostly moderates - opposed to the bill, with at least 17 lawmakers still undecided.\n\nAs of Monday, no vote has been scheduled, and it remains unclear if there will be one before the House recesses for a week-long break this Friday. Vice President Mike Pence, who has been working with congressional leaders on the health care effort from the start, visited Capitol Hill on Monday and Tuesday to lobby lawmakers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, whose White House was initially optimistic the House could pass a bill on Wednesday, has added to the uncertainty by suggesting the measure may still be changed. \"I want it to be good for sick people. It's not in its final form right now,\" he said during an Oval Office interview with Bloomberg News. \"It will be every bit as good on pre-existing conditions as Obamacare.\"\n\nThe Republican Party can only afford to lose 22 votes, assuming all Republicans are able to attend the vote and no Democrats cross over. As they count votes, GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who was expected to be out for three to four weeks after surgery, returned Monday from Utah and will back the bill, his office said.\n\nNotably, Rep. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri who serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee, announced his opposition to the legislation on Monday. Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Daniel Webster of Florida, and Chris Smith of New Jersey will also vote against the current bill, making their decisions public in succession Monday afternoon.\n\nHeading into a Republican whip meeting Monday afternoon, some members were still undecided, including Reps. Kevin Yoder, David Valadao, Erik Paulson, Elise Stefanik, and Adam Kinzinger.\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry, the chief GOP deputy whip, told reporters that he had no predictions on when and if a bill would come up this week.\n\nThe hope is that leadership can sell moderates on the fact that this bill is going over to the Senate where it might be significantly reworked. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, is already talking to members in the Senate about changes he'd like to see.\n\nAs hard as it is, Republican congressional leaders know they can't simply abandon their effort now. \"I hope we keep going. I don't think we can stop,\" said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Republican who serves on the House's Energy and Commerce Committee, last week.\n\nWhite House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn sounded optimistic Monday morning when asked if he thought Republicans' plans for health care had enough votes. \"I think we do,\" Cohn told CBS. \"This is going be a great week. We're going to get health care down to the floor of the House. We're convinced we've got the votes and we're going to keep moving on with our agenda.\"\n\nThe fight over how pre-existing conditions are covered is at the center of the fight. Trump said Sunday the White House is pushing forward, and that the GOP plan \"guarantees\" coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions. \"Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, 'Has to be,'\" Trump said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\n\nHowever, under the GOP bill, insurers could charge those with pre-existing conditions higher rates than others in the plan if they allow their coverage to lapse. Republicans seem to be in a never-ending cycle of trying to please the moderate and conservative wings of their party, but pressure from the White House to deliver a legislative win for Trump is real. Also real: the repeated pledges to their constituents over the past seven years to repeal and replace Obamacare if given the chance.\n\nA new amendment sponsored by moderate leader Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey gave states the ability to opt out of more Obamacare regulations. The amendment was also enough to finally bring the conservative House Freedom Caucus on board.\n\nHowever, the amendment, which experts noted could drive up the cost of insurance for older Americans and those with pre-existing conditions, spooked moderates and left some - who had been supportive of the legislation before - scrambling to publicly voice their discontentment. All of a sudden, it was moderates in the hot seat.\n\nIt seemed that even though leadership may have gained upwards of 30 new votes from the Freedom Caucus, they were suffering significant enough losses from the other side of the party that they still could not bring a bill up to the floor for a vote in order to mark Trump's first 100 days in office.\n\nThis week, leadership's focus remains trying to help those moderates get comfortable with the new MacArthur amendment. Over the weekend, House leaders, as well as Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, spoke with members hoping to flip enough votes to move the bill forward. Leadership aides emphasize that there is not much room to change the proposal at this point, but many deputy whips are trying to get members to keep the process in perspective.\n\n\"You remind them there is a United States Senate, and it will change things. What we send over there is not going over there on stone tablets,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma. \"Going back to the drawing board would be death to repeal and replace.\"\n\nAfter last week, many moderates are frustrated with the process. Some say they see their party making the same kind of mistakes Republicans criticized Democrats for making back in 2010.\n\n\"We didn't learn anything from their mistakes,\" said Rep. Mark Amodei, a moderate Republican from Nevada, last week. \"We learned nothing from their mistakes.\"\n\nAs to promises the bill will be changed once it's in the Senate?\n\n\"Seriously, you want me to go back and tell the people in my fourth of Nevada 'the Senate will make it better?'\" Amodei said. \"What the hell?\"",
    " Title: High School Students Protest Alleged Lack of Action Against Bullying in Oklahoma\n\nArticle:\n\n-Start of Article-\n\nHundreds of students from Norman High School in Oklahoma walked out of their school on Monday to protest the school's response to alleged bullying of three classmates who claim they were raped by the same individual. The students were joined by parents and members of the community outside the school, with junior Sophia Babb telling CNN that the crowd waved signs and chanted slogans such as \"No justice, no class\" and \"No more bullying.\"\n\nThe students' protest stems from allegations by three female Norman High School students who say they were mercilessly bullied after reporting separate instances of rape by the same person. The teens and their families claim that school administrators failed to take adequate action after the rapes and bullying were reported.\n\nThe story gained traction on social media after Jezebel published a detailed account of the incidents last Friday. No arrests or charges have been made yet, Norman Police Department Captain Tom Easley told CNN. An investigation began a month ago, and no details will be released until it concludes. A Norman High School spokesperson had not returned CNN's request for comment by publication time.\n\nIn a letter to the school community, Norman Public Schools Superintendent Joe Siano encouraged parents to talk to their children about alternatives to the walkout, such as wearing stickers and ribbons provided by the school \"in symbolic support.\" He also said the school was enlarging a task force to study the implementation of a \"targeted, research-based sexual assault curriculum for students,\" and that the school will continue to respond quickly to reports of sexual assault and bullying.\n\nThe three teens told Jezebel that they stopped attending classes and left school voluntarily after the teasing became unbearable. Friends of the teens started a Facebook page, YES ALL Daughters, two weeks ago to show support for them. Babb said the page drew nearly 10,000 likes in two weeks. With the help of their mothers and relatives, they organized Monday's protest.\n\n\"After hearing the story, we felt compelled to help the kids do something,\" said Stacie Wright, whose niece started the Facebook page.\n\nThe group posted a long list of \"Protest Do's and Don'ts\" on its Facebook page to ensure the event remained peaceful. The list included instructions such as \"Be Peaceful, Law-Abiding Citizens that do not disturb local businesses\" and \"Be a Good Neighbor.\"\n\nThe Daily Oklahoman reported that the crowd of protesters on Monday was in the hundreds. However, organizers estimated that 1,500 attended the protest outside the school, which has an enrollment of about 1,800 students.\n\n\"It shows that students won't put up with this harassment and bullying,\" Babb said. \"We stand in solidarity with all victims and we want to show that we support them.\"\n\n-End of Article-",
    " Title: Analysis of Ryan's Speech at the Republican National Convention: Focus on Debt, Lack of Clarity on Economic Growth\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan delivered a passionate speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa on Wednesday, receiving a standing ovation from the audience. The speech, while effective in its delivery, was criticized for its lack of clarity on economic growth solutions.\n\nRyan, in his speech, dismantled the Obama administration's economic policies, particularly the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. He also defended the Republican party against the common Democratic attacks on Medicare reform, often referred to as \"Mediscare\" by the opposition.\n\nHowever, the speech was met with disappointment as Ryan's economic growth solutions were deemed unclear. Instead of discussing Mitt Romney's tax rate proposals, Ryan used the term \"tax fairness,\" a term often used by President Obama and other liberal Democrats. This was surprising, as Ryan is known for his association with supply-side economics and the Reagan tax reform.\n\nIn the speech, Ryan failed to mention the proposed 20% across-the-board reduction in marginal tax rates and the 25% corporate tax rate reduction, which have been proposed by Mitt Romney. Instead, the speech focused heavily on the issue of debt, a point that some argue may not resonate with the unemployed or marginally employed.\n\nThe article argues that the Republican party traditionally loses when they run on debt and deficits, but wins when they run on growth, limited government, lower spending, lower tax rates, and deregulation. The author expresses disappointment in the lack of clarity on growth solutions in Ryan's speech and hopes that Mitt Romney will clarify his own growth policies during his speech on Thursday.\n\nThe article concludes by stating the author's desire for growth, growth, growth, but did not find it in Ryan's speech, instead hearing debt, debt, debt. The author's call for growth solutions to be made clearer ahead of the upcoming election is a reminder of the importance of economic growth in the minds of voters.",
    " Title: Narendra Modi: From Tea Vendor to India's Potential Prime Minister\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of India's recently concluded parliamentary elections, Narendra Modi, the charismatic leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is poised to become India's next prime minister, with his party heading towards a landslide victory. Modi, who began his political journey as a tea vendor's son, has been chief minister of the state of Gujarat since 2001, where he is credited for the state's strong economic growth. However, the 2002 religious riots in Gujarat remain a contentious issue in Modi's political legacy.\n\nModi's rise to power is remarkable in a country known for political dynasties. He joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organization, at a young age and rose through its ranks. The BJP, Modi's party, maintains close ties with the RSS.\n\nModi's personal life has been the subject of much speculation. He is married but only acknowledged his wife's existence in April, when he filed his nomination papers. Despite this, Modi has been chief minister of Gujarat for 13 years, during which he made it one of India's best-performing states economically. He is known for his self-discipline and austerity.\n\nUnder Modi's leadership, the economy of Gujarat has nearly tripled in size. He is also known for his decisiveness, efficiency, and his ability to root out corruption, stimulate investment, and cut through bureaucratic red tape. Indian business executives frequently rank Gujarat as one of the easiest states in India in which to do business.\n\nHowever, not everyone has benefited from Gujarat's economic progress. Half of all children under the age of 5 suffer from malnutrition, and two-thirds of rural households lack toilets. Furthermore, Gujarat's entrepreneurial tradition predates Modi, but he is credited with making the government machinery accountable.\n\nThe 2002 anti-Muslim violence that occurred under Modi's watch remains a significant concern for many Indians. Hundreds of Muslims were killed in the riots that followed the burning of a train compartment carrying Hindu pilgrims; 59 of those pilgrims died. Some of Modi's close aides were found guilty of participating in the violence. Modi has denied any responsibility, but critics argue that he did not take sufficient action to stop the violence.\n\nThe Indian government's own data show urban Muslims in Gujarat are worse off than Muslims in the rest of the country. However, Gujarat is one of the top states in the country for Muslim employment. While Modi is praised for his organizational skills and governance style, he is also criticized as vindictive and abrasive, and capable of holding grudges for years and intolerant of dissent.\n\nModi's potential prime ministership has raised concerns in the international community due to the 2002 Gujarat riots. Modi was denied a U.S. visa following the riots, but it is likely he would be granted one if he becomes prime minister and applies for a visa. Modi has met with U.S. and European officials, and it appears that, if he becomes prime minister of the world's largest democracy, Modi would not be isolated in the West or the international community.\n\nIn conclusion, Narendra Modi's political journey from a tea vendor's son to a potential prime minister is a remarkable one. His economic policies have been praised, but his handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots remains a significant concern for many Indians and the international community. As India prepares for a new government, the future of Modi's leadership will be closely watched both domestically and internationally.",
    " Title: Hurricane Sandy Disrupts Presidential Campaign Schedules as East Coast Braces for Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Hurricane Sandy approaches the eastern United States, both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have adjusted their campaign schedules in response to the impending storm. The National Hurricane Center projects that tropical storm conditions will soon affect the North Carolina coast, with landfall expected around Delaware and New Jersey late Monday or early Tuesday.\n\nPresident Obama has canceled campaign events in Northern Virginia on Monday and in Colorado Springs, Colo. on Tuesday. Mitt Romney has canceled all of his events scheduled for Virginia on Sunday and will instead campaign in Ohio on Monday morning.\n\nThe storm currently sits off the coast of Florida, and tropical storm watches and warnings are in effect in the Carolinas. Federal officials warn that the East Coast from South Carolina on up should be prepared for heavy rains and winds, with inland areas potentially seeing up to 2 feet or more of snow.\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate emphasized that the storm's reach will extend to areas far inland, such as the Ohio Valley and Appalachian regions, and may cause flooding in the D.C. area's rivers. FEMA and other federal partners are already sending teams and resources into potentially impacted areas to support state and local preparedness efforts.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano urged those along the East Coast to closely monitor the progress of Hurricane Sandy and follow the guidance and direction of their state and local officials. Both Napolitano and Fugate reached out to governors up and down the East Coast throughout Saturday.\n\nPresident Obama is expected to leave Washington for Florida on Sunday afternoon before the brunt of the storm hits the D.C. metro area. He will hold an event in Youngstown, Ohio, before returning to Washington to monitor the storm. Vice President Joe Biden is set to appear in Ohio on Tuesday.\n\nBoth White House and campaign officials downplayed the storm's potential effect on turnout in swing states as well as the optics of campaigning during a looming disaster. The safety of staff, supporters, and volunteers is the top priority for both campaigns.",
    " Title: Trump Cancels Planned Veterans Day Parade in Washington DC Over High Cost Estimates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, US President Donald Trump has announced the cancellation of a planned Veterans Day military parade in Washington DC due to high costs associated with the event. The parade, initially set for November 11, the centenary of the end of World War One, was estimated to cost around $90 million (\u00a371m), more than three times the original estimate.\n\nIn a series of tweets, President Trump criticized local politicians for requesting an exorbitant figure for the parade. He wrote, \"The local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it. When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it.\"\n\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser responded to the president's tweet, emulating his tone. Meanwhile, a Pentagon spokesperson, Col Rob Manning, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense and the White House \"have now agreed to explore opportunities in 2019.\"\n\nInitially, the budget director had estimated costs of between $10m and $30m when the White House announced its request in February. However, a US official later provided a new estimate of $92m. The parade's budget director had also noted that no tanks would be used to avoid damaging the roads of the nation's capital.\n\nThe District of Columbia Council, Washington's legislative body, was critical of the plan when it was announced, voicing displeasure on Twitter. Members of the Democratic party were similarly sceptical, with congressman Jim McGovern declaring it \"an absurd waste of money\" on Twitter and saying Mr Trump \"acts more like dictator than president.\"\n\nThe Pentagon had planned for the military to march from the White House to the Capitol, with the parade featuring a \"heavy air component at the end.\" The focus was set to be the work of US military veterans through the ages, starting with the American revolution.\n\nIt is worth noting that President Trump had previously cancelled planned military exercises with South Korea in June after his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, citing the need to \"save a fortune.\" The US had a military parade in 1991 following the end of its successful campaign to force Saddam Hussein's troops out of Kuwait.\n\nParis will hold its long-planned parade on the same day, while the event at Maryland's Andrews Air Force Base is scheduled for a \"different date,\" according to the president. Mr Trump had previously expressed admiration for France's Bastille Day parade during a visit to Paris in 2017, stating he wanted the US to \"top it.\" The president has not ruled out the possibility of a future parade in Washington DC.",
    " Title: GOP-Authored Obamacare Repeal Bill Clears House, Faces Uncertain Future in Senate\n\nThe House of Representatives has passed a bill, known as the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, that aims to repeal key components of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The bill, which defunds Planned Parenthood for one year, was passed with a vote of 240-189. However, the bill's future in the Senate is uncertain, as some vocal conservatives argue that the bill does not go far enough in repealing Obamacare.\n\nThe bill, if enacted, would repeal the individual and employer insurance mandates, as well as taxes on medical device sales and the so-called \"Cadillac tax\" on generous health plans. The bill's passage in the House was facilitated by a tool known as budget reconciliation, which allows the bill to pass with a simple majority in the Senate and avoid a filibuster.\n\nPresident Obama can still veto the bill, but Republican leaders are hoping to demonstrate their ability to dismantle Obamacare with a simple Senate majority and a GOP president in 2017. Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, stated, \"Let's get this bill to the president's desk and let him make a decision. Is he going to finally stand up for American workers and sign this bill? Or is he going to continue to support a law that's destroying jobs and destroying health care in this country?\"\n\nDemocrats criticized the bill, with Rep. Louise Slaughter, a New York Democrat, stating, \"I don't know why the American public is not outraged over the fact that none of their business is taken care of, but over and over and over again we talk about taking health care away from people.\"\n\nThe bill's path through the Senate will be challenging, as it must first win the approval of the chamber's parliamentarian, who will rule on which provisions meet reconciliation's arcane rules. Already, Republican sponsors have stripped out a provision that would repeal Obamacare's Medicare spending board, as the parliamentarian was likely to rule it out of order.\n\nA trio of Senate Republicans, including two 2016 presidential hopefuls, have stated that the legislation \"simply isn't good enough\" and reneges on repeated vows to repeal the entire law. The bill passed on the strength of Republican votes, with only seven GOP members rejecting it and one Democrat, Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, voting \"yes,\" though he has been opposed to Obamacare in the past.\n\nThe bill's passage in the House marks a significant step in the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, but its future in the Senate remains uncertain. The bill's success will depend on the parliamentarian's rulings and the ability of Republican leaders to win over conservative senators who are demanding a full repeal of the law.",
    " Title: Congressional Hearing Raises Questions Over DHS Ammunition Purchases\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a hearing on Thursday, Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz questioned the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over its ammunition purchases, stating that the department is using roughly 1,000 rounds of ammunition more per person than the U.S. Army.\n\nChaffetz, R-Utah, expressed his bewilderment over the department's need for such a large quantity of ammunition, stating, \"It is entirely inexplicable why the Department of Homeland Security needs so much ammunition.\"\n\nThe hearing, which was unusual in its public scrutiny of the department's ammunition purchases, had previously been a topic of discussion on blogs and occasional news articles. However, as the DHS found itself defending the purchases, lawmakers showed increasing interest in the issue.\n\nDemocratic Rep. John Tierney, D-Mass., dismissed the concerns as \"conspiracy theories\" with \"no place\" in the committee room.\n\nHowever, Republicans argued that the purchases raise \"serious\" questions about waste and accountability. Chaffetz, who chairs one of the House oversight subcommittees, revealed that the department currently has more than 260 million rounds in stock. He said the department bought more than 103 million rounds in 2012 and used 116 million that same year, among roughly 70,000 agents.\n\nComparing that with the small-arms purchases procured by the U.S. Army, he said the DHS is churning through between 1,300 and 1,600 rounds per officer, while the U.S. Army goes through roughly 350 rounds per soldier.\n\nNick Nayak, chief procurement officer for the Department of Homeland Security, did not challenge Chaffetz's numbers. However, Nayak sought to counter what he described as several misconceptions about the bullet buys.\n\nDespite reports that the department was trying to buy up to 1.6 billion rounds over five years, he said that is not true. He later clarified that the number is closer to 750 million. He said the department, on average, buys roughly 100 million rounds per year.\n\nHe also said claims that the department is stockpiling ammo are \"simply not true.\" Further, he countered claims that the purchases are helping create broader ammunition shortages in the U.S.\n\nThe department has long said it needs the bullets for agents in training and on duty, and buys in bulk to save money. While Democrats likened concerns about the purchases to conspiracy theories, Republicans raised concern about the sheer cost of the ammunition.\n\n\"This is not about conspiracy theories, this is about good government,\" Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who chairs the full Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he suspects rounds are being stockpiled, and then either \"disposed of,\" passed to non-federal agencies, or shot \"indiscriminately.\" If that is the case, he said, \"then shame on you.\"",
    " Title: Romney Accuses Obama Administration of Misunderstanding Radical Islam, Criticizes Response to Middle East Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a major foreign-policy speech at the Virginia Military Institute on Monday, Mitt Romney accused the Obama administration of fundamentally misunderstanding the threat of radical Islam. The Republican presidential nominee argued that President Obama's response to the assault on American diplomatic posts in Egypt and Libya, as well as his overall approach to foreign affairs, is emblematic of this misunderstanding.\n\nRomney, who delayed for nearly a month before delivering the speech, sharpened his attack on the way Mr. Obama handled the attacks, stating that the president's initial reaction was to blame an Internet video mocking Islam, and only belatedly to acknowledge \"the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others.\"\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor will argue that Mr. Obama's response to the attacks is indicative of his overall approach to foreign affairs, which Romney said he will change by asserting more American influence. He plans to use foreign aid to pressure Egypt to protect democracy, build the Syrian opposition, and restart negotiations toward a two-state solution for the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\n\"I believe that if America does not lead, others will \u2014 others who do not share our interests and our values \u2014 and the world will grow darker, for our friends and for us,\" Romney will say. \"America\u2019s security and the cause of freedom can not afford four more years like the last four years.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign has criticized Romney's foreign policy credentials, stating that he has not demonstrated his ability to handle foreign policy. \"We\u2019re not going to be lectured by someone who has been an unmitigated disaster on foreign policy every time he\u2019s dipped his toe in the foreign policy waters,\" Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One on Sunday.\n\nThe economy has dominated the presidential race, but Iran's nuclear program and the Sept. 11 attacks on the American Embassy in Cairo and the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, have thrust foreign affairs into the headlines. Mr. Obama and his advisers initially said the attacks were sparked by a video mocking the Prophet Muhammad, but have since acknowledged that the attack in Benghazi was orchestrated by terrorist elements linked to al Qaeda.\n\nRomney's advisers have stated that he starts from a completely different philosophy that begins with the belief that the fight against terrorism can't be conducted surgically. \"While drones and drone attacks are worthwhile and it\u2019s good to kill bad guys, you fundamentally misunderstand this struggle if you think that\u2019s the answer to it,\" said Richard S. Williamson, a former assistant secretary of state who is advising Romney.\n\nRomney chose VMI, in Lexington, Va., to deliver the speech because it was the alma mater of George C. Marshall, who, as secretary of state and secretary of defense, helped craft the foreign policy that guided Republicans and Democrats after World War II.\n\nOver the past week, the presidential race has turned into a bit of a roller coaster, with Romney's strong debate performance and then the release of unemployment numbers benefiting Mr. Obama. Mr. Obama also announced his campaign and allied party organizations collected $181 million in donations in September. The campaigns have spent several days wrestling over their contrasting economic messages, with both sides exchanging rhetorical blows on the television talk-show circuit and the battle spilling onto the television airwaves in Florida, a key state come Election Day.",
    " Title: Trump's Embrace of American Health Care Act: A Betrayal of Promises Made to Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has been widely criticized as a betrayal of his campaign promises, President Donald Trump has endorsed the American Health Care Act, a bill authored by House Republicans and other establishment-minded members of his administration. The bill, which represents a significant departure from Trump's repeated promises to the American people, is set to cut millions from health insurance coverage and Medicaid spending, while providing tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump made clear promises on health care policy, stating that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid, and that he would offer patients a more generous deal than they were getting from the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, the centerpiece of the Trump-endorsed American Health Care Act is a $600 billion tax cut, with the majority of the benefits going to the top 0.1% of income earners.\n\nIn May 2015, Trump told the conservative Daily Signal, \"I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.\" He reiterated these promises throughout his campaign, telling 60 Minutes in the fall of 2015, \"I am going to take care of everybody.\"\n\nHowever, the American Health Care Act, if passed, would result in 6 to 15 million people losing insurance, according to estimates by Standard & Poor's and Brookings analysts. The bill shifts $370 billion in Medicaid costs onto state governments, and drastically reduces federal subsidies to help people pay for insurance, particularly in high-cost states.\n\nThe bill also specifically disadvantages certain groups of people, such as older Americans and residents of rural areas where the cost of health insurance is inherently higher due to reduced competition.\n\nWhile Trump's promises on health care policy may have been popular, it remains to be seen whether his voters will care about the betrayal of those promises. However, it is clear that the American Health Care Act represents a significant departure from Trump's campaign promises and a potential harm to the very people who voted for him.",
    " Title: Opinion: Pelosi's Remark on Trump's Weight Sparks Debate on Political Decorum\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the ongoing political discourse took a new direction on Monday, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comments on President Donald Trump's weight sparked a heated debate on political correctness and hypocrisy.\n\nPelosi, in an interview with CNN, expressed concern over Trump's reported use of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, while refusing to wear a mask in public. She stated, \"He's our president, and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group \u2014 morbidly obese.\"\n\nThe comment, while intended as a health concern, was met with a mix of laughter and outrage, depending on one's political stance. For some, it was a not-so-subtle dig at the president, while for others, it was seen as a breach of political decorum.\n\nThe ensuing debate on social media was a reflection of the polarized political climate, with supporters of the president dismissing Pelosi's comment as a harmless jab, while critics accused her of \"fat-shaming\" the president.\n\nThe president himself has a history of making controversial and insensitive comments, including derogatory remarks about women, immigrants, the media, and various minority groups. This history, some argue, makes it hypocritical for Pelosi to criticize Trump for his weight.\n\nHowever, others argue that Pelosi's comment was made in the context of a health concern, and should not be equated with the president's repeated instances of offensive and derogatory language.\n\nThe debate highlights the complexities of political discourse in the current climate, where lines between personal and political, acceptable and unacceptable, are often blurred. As the nation grapples with a global health crisis and a contentious election, the need for political decorum and sensitivity towards others, regardless of political affiliation, remains a pressing issue.\n\nS.E. Cupp, the host of \"S.E. Cupp Unfiltered\" on CNN, weighed in on the debate, stating, \"The president has referred to women over the course of his public career as 'dogs,' 'pigs,' 'fat,' 'ugly,''slobs,' 'lowlifes' and 'horseface'; he has bragged about grabbing women by the genitals, and has been accused by no fewer than 25 women of sexual misconduct; he has attacked women journalists for doing their jobs, and mused on multiple occasions that women are more suited for housework; he has mocked a girl with Asperger's, a disabled journalist, a prisoner of war, a Gold Star family and even his own supporters; he has called the media 'losers,' 'nasty' and 'human scum,' accused one news anchor of murder, suggested another was menstruating and that another was bleeding from a bad facelift; he insisted former President Barack Obama was from Kenya, maligned immigrants from'shithole countries,' said a gathering of neo-Nazis included'some very fine people,' and trafficked heavily in online anti-Semitic tropes.\"\n\nThe debate, Cupp concludes, raises questions about political correctness and the application of rules in the current political climate. \"Rules? Where we're going, we don't need rules,\" she tweeted, quoting a famous line from the movie \"The Dark Knight.\"\n\nAs the nation moves forward, the debate on political correctness and the application of rules in political discourse is likely to continue, reflecting the complexities and nuances of the current political climate.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Face Challenges in Delivering on Obamacare Premium Reduction Promises\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans are grappling with finding a viable solution to reduce health insurance premiums as part of their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The GOP has limited options to lower premiums, including offering larger subsidies, allowing for skimpier coverage, or permitting insurers to charge more to those with pre-existing conditions and older individuals.\n\nThe challenge for Senate Republicans lies in achieving their goal of reducing premiums without compromising consumer protections, such as the ban on insurers charging more for coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. If they were to roll back these regulations, it could leave millions of Americans unable to afford coverage due to increased premiums associated with common illnesses like heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or cancer.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office's report on the House repeal plan has further complicated the Senate's task. The analysis concluded that allowing states to opt out of Obamacare's pre-existing condition requirement would destabilize markets and potentially drive premiums up for older, sicker individuals. Several Republican sources say the CBO's assessment would encourage lawmakers to preserve Obamacare's pre-existing condition policy.\n\nNot all Republicans are convinced that Obamacare's pre-existing condition policy is the primary cause of premium increases. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) stated, \"A lot of people don't want to touch that [pre-existing conditions policy]. I would like to [address it], because I think you can handle pre-existing conditions in a different way without collapsing markets.\"\n\nRepublicans have proposed allowing insurers to sell more basic policies without certain benefits, such as maternity coverage, mental health, or prescription drug benefits. They argue that consumers should be able to buy more basic policies tailored to their specific needs. However, they may face challenges in implementing these changes due to the complex rules governing the fast-track process being used to avoid a Democratic filibuster.\n\nSome Republicans also support allowing insurers to charge older people higher premiums, although Republican leaders appear to have been deterred by the backlash House Republicans faced when they initially proposed this idea.\n\nUltimately, the GOP's drive to reduce premiums could result in an increase in the number of uninsured Americans. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House repeal bill, which would scrap many insurance regulations, would result in 23 million more uninsured Americans by 2026 than under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPremiums vary across the country but have generally been on the rise. This year, benchmark Obamacare policies in 17 major cities rose an average of 9 percent, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. That's up from 2 percent in 2016.\n\nRepublicans, mindful of the Democrats' experience when Obamacare was enacted in 2010, have been careful not to put a dollar figure on how much premiums will decline. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, stated, \"The thing we'll be judged by is the extent to which we've overcome the promises of the Obama administration.\"\n\nIn the end, the success of the GOP's efforts to reduce premiums will depend on their ability to strike a balance between lowering costs and preserving consumer protections.",

In his speech, Trump pointed to alleged hypocrisy from Democrats who, he said, wanted to fire former FBI Director James Comey but changed their tune when Trump fired him in 2017.\n\nTrump also took aim at the Russia probe, referring to it as the \"collusion delusion.\" He went on to say that the report, being produced by individuals who were not elected, was being produced by people who were not elected.\n\nIn a separate development, Trump claimed that Michael Cohen's newly revealed book proposal discredits his testimony. \"Unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that should not be there, and all of a sudden they're trying to take you out with 'bullshit,'\" he said to the delighted crowd in Maryland.\n\nTrump also took aim at the Green New Deal, a comprehensive overhaul of America's economy and a shift to 100 percent renewable energy being pushed by left-wing Democrats and 2020 presidential hopefuls. \"When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric: 'Darling, is the wind blowing? I'd like to watch television,'\" he quipped.\n\nThe president also used anecdotes to promote his policies at home and abroad, particularly pulling back troops from the Middle East. He spoke at length about how he flew into Iraq over Christmas and was told to kill the lights on Air Force One as it came into land. \"We spent $7 trillion, and we can't land a plane with the lights on,\" he said.\n\nAs Trump spoke, the crowd appeared to eat up everything he had to say. Ahead of the speech, audience members stood on chairs, craning their necks to get a glimpse as the Rolling Stones' \"Time Is On My Side\" blared through the speakers, indicating the president's imminent arrival.",
    " Title: Former NSA Leaders Express Confusion Over Nunes' Allegations of Surveillance on Trump Transition Team\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of former top National Security Agency (NSA) officials gathered on Friday prior to an academic conference in Washington, discussing the ongoing investigation by the House Intelligence Committee into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The conversation centered around the committee's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), who this week accused President Trump's transition team of being subject to surveillance by U.S. intelligence.\n\nThe claims made by Nunes, and his decision to share this information with Mr. Trump before his panel, have caused a stir, following a series of testimonies stating there was no evidence to support Trump's explosive allegation that he was wiretapped by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. The ex-NSA leaders found Nunes' claims vague and inconsistent, and they were unsure about the type of surveillance he was referring to.\n\nJames A. Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and former State Department official, witnessed the discussion and stated, \"They were scratching their heads trying to figure out what was going on.\"\n\nThe confusion surrounding Nunes' actions has raised concerns about the credibility of the Intelligence Committee's investigation, which includes looking into allegations of collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials. Critics have called for an independent commission or select committee to take over the Russia issue, while Nunes maintains that he is fulfilling his responsibilities as intelligence panel chief.\n\nNunes' dispute began on Wednesday when he held a press conference to announce that a source had revealed \"dozens of reports\" showing that unnamed U.S. intelligence agencies had collected information about Trump or members of his transition team as part of their \"normal foreign surveillance.\" This collection was legal, said Nunes, but it was not confirmation that Trump's tweets claiming he was wiretapped by Mr. Obama were true.\n\nSince then, Nunes has walked back some of his original implications. He does not have the documents in question in his possession, though he's requested them from the NSA. He is not sure whether Trump officials were part of the conversations collected by U.S. intelligence, or whether their names were simply mentioned by two foreign persons under U.S. surveillance.\n\nOn Friday, Nunes declined to say how many Trump-related names had been \"unmasked\" in the documents he is referring to. \"I don't know that yet,\" he said, stating that he was waiting for the NSA to provide copies of the documents for his full perusal.\n\nPresumably, the Intelligence Committee chairman is referring to reports or other summaries of emails or phone conversations obtained by the NSA under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This law allows the NSA to listen in on foreign targets, but if the foreign target happens to contact a U.S. citizen, the NSA can still spy on the communications. That's called \"incidental collection.\" However, the agency has to mask the name of the American. The name can be unmasked for compelling intelligence reasons.\n\nThe specifics of who was being surveilled and why remain unclear. James A. Lewis of CSIS notes, \"It could have been a Russian under surveillance talking to an American \u2013 Ambassador Sergey Kislyak talking to former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, for instance. Or it could have been foreigners simply talking about an American.\"\n\nThe reasons for unmasking the names would also remain a question. Perhaps they were integral to the intelligence value of the conversation \u2013 it would be indicative if someone were speaking of an important Trump associate, for instance. On Friday, Nunes said he could not figure out why the names he's seen were not hidden, but he added that all of it appeared to be \"legal surveillance\" as well as \"valuable intelligence.\"\n\nWithout more details, it's unclear whether Nunes has uncovered a situation that's troubling or not. However, by raising the charge, he's increased the political temperature of his own panel's work. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), has said that Nunes' actions have raised \"profound doubt\" about the panel's ability to conduct an impartial investigation of Russian meddling. Nunes didn't brief the committee on his findings until he'd been to the White House and held two press conferences, Representative Schiff said.\n\nOn Friday, the situation became further inflamed when Nunes canceled a public hearing scheduled to feature former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, among others. In its place, the panel will hold a closed hearing with FBI director James Comey and NSA chief Adm. Mike Rogers, who testified publicly earlier in the week.\n\n\"It's necessary to get both of them back down here before we can move onto other interviews,\" Nunes said.",
    " Title: Trump Attempts to Pivot Campaign Strategy as Election Nears, but Challenges Remain\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to revitalize his struggling presidential campaign, Republican nominee Donald Trump has made significant changes to his campaign staff and has expressed regret for some of his past statements. The shake-up includes the appointment of Stephen Bannon, an executive from Breitbart News, as the campaign's chief executive, effectively demoting Paul Manafort who subsequently resigned.\n\nIn a rare admission, Trump acknowledged that he has said the \"wrong thing\" at times during his presidential bid and expressed regret. This move comes as the candidate is facing a steep decline in the polls, with voters in swing states, red states, and blue states increasingly alienated by his remarks.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Trump is even struggling to maintain the support of his core demographic, white men. This development, if confirmed, could potentially lead to a landslide victory for the Democrats, capturing the White House by a significant margin, securing control of the Senate for the first time since 2010, and possibly gaining a majority in the House of Representatives, although the odds of this remain low.\n\nThe Republican Party is reportedly feeling the heat, with good reason. Pivoting to a \"New Trump,\" as some are calling it, won't be easy. It's a challenge for any candidate at this stage of the campaign, and it's certainly a challenge for Donald Trump.\n\nWhile there are always a few polls that suggest the race might be tightening, a broader look at the data indicates that Trump is consistently struggling in almost every part of the country, including in very red states like Utah.\n\nAccording to my colleague at Princeton, Sam Wang, when all the polls are considered together, Trump does not stand much of a chance of winning. Clinton is currently running 5.8 percentage points above President Obama's standing versus 2012 GOP candidate Mitt Romney at the same point in the campaign four years ago.\n\nDespite speculation that Trump would pivot to a more moderate stance to appeal to a wider audience, he has consistently failed to do so. Occasionally, he gives carefully calibrated speeches using a teleprompter, but then immediately reverts to his more extreme messages.\n\nTrump's advisers have not been able to push him in a different direction, and as he slips in the polls, his instincts seem to be to double down on his provocative style. Efforts to reach out to new constituencies, such as African-American voters, will not be easy.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has made an attempt to appeal to African-American voters by criticizing Democrats for failing to deliver on their promises to the community. However, these kinds of speeches will do little to sway a part of the American electorate whose support for Trump remains at a stunningly low level of 1 percent.\n\nAs the summer comes to a close, we are pretty late into the election game. While there have been moments in US history when candidates have been able to rapidly gain ground on their opponents, these comebacks are rare. Given the chaotic and underdeveloped state of Trump's campaign field operation in the swing states, it will be extremely difficult for him to achieve anything of this sort.\n\nThe three presidential debates, which begin in late September, offer an opportunity to change the direction of the race. However, most often, there is no October Surprise. Fundamentally changing the direction of the campaign will be extremely hard for the GOP. The recent comments and new campaign staff won't be enough. Republicans might conclude that they will be better off focusing on the Senate and House races than placing too much hope in the idea that the man at the top of the ticket has a big trick up his sleeve.",
    " Title: Trump's Tweets Spark Controversy: A Closer Look at the President's Remarks Towards Democratic Congresswomen\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, President Donald Trump directed criticism towards four freshman Democratic representatives, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley. The tweets, which have been met with widespread backlash, have been labeled as racist and anti-American by many.\n\nTrump's tweets, in essence, told the quartet to \"go back\" to the countries they came from, implying that they should leave the United States and fix the problems in their \"totally broken and crime-infested\" homelands. However, three out of the four representatives were born in the United States, and the fourth, Ilhan Omar, is a naturalized US citizen, having been born in Somalia and spending her formative years in a refugee camp in Kenya.\n\nThe sentiment expressed in Trump's tweets has been widely criticized as racist, as it targets non-white women and suggests that they are not truly American or that their views are not welcome in the country. The Merriam-Webster definition of racism, \"A belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race,\" seems to apply in this case.\n\nFurthermore, the remarks have been deemed anti-American, as they contradict the long-held American ideal of a melting pot society, where diversity is celebrated and valued. The United States, since at least the early 20th century, has been known for its acceptance of immigrants from various backgrounds, and the blending of cultures and ideas is seen as a strength rather than a weakness.\n\nTrump's comments have sparked a heated debate, with some defending the president's right to free speech, while others argue that his words are divisive and harmful. The controversy has also raised questions about the role of political leaders in shaping public discourse and the impact of their words on society.\n\nIn the past, President Trump has been criticized for his divisive rhetoric, particularly towards minority groups. During his campaign, he painted a dark picture of a diverse America, deriding so-called PC culture and suggesting that if he was not elected, it would mark the end of the American experiment. In his inauguration speech, he described America as a nation plagued by poverty, rusted-out factories, and a failing education system.\n\nThe insidious idea underlying Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan is that America was better off before the influx of diversity. This notion, which implies that America was better when everyone knew their place and when people did not question authority, has been widely criticized as racist and anti-American.\n\nIn contrast, former President Barack Obama, during his 2008 campaign, spoke of the importance of unity and the celebration of diversity in America. He emphasized the need to work together to create a more just, equal, and prosperous America, where everyone, regardless of their race, gender, or ethnicity, could contribute to the betterment of society.\n\nThe current controversy surrounding Trump's tweets serves as a stark reminder of the importance of understanding, empathy, and unity in a diverse and complex society. It is a call to action for all Americans to strive for a more perfect union, one that values and celebrates the diversity of its people and works towards a better future for all.",
    " Title: China's Interest in Iraq's Oil Fields: A Potential Boon for Stability and Energy Diversification\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the China National Petroleum Corporation has expressed interest in acquiring a significant stake in Iraq's West Qurna I oil field, a move that could potentially see Exxon Mobil divesting due to its oil interests in Iraqi Kurdistan. Despite initial resistance, Exxon Mobil has shown openness to forming a partnership with the Chinese company.\n\nThis development, while it may seem detrimental to U.S. interests given the historical context, is not necessarily so, according to American energy experts. The increased Iraqi oil production, much of it pumped by Chinese workers, has helped shield the world economy from oil price spikes due to Western sanctions on Iranian oil exports. Moreover, the surge in American domestic oil production from shale fields has diminished the country's reliance on Middle Eastern oil, making access to Iraqi fields less critical for the U.S.\n\nChina's interest in Iraq could potentially contribute to the country's stability amidst growing sectarian conflict. David Goldwyn, former State Department coordinator for international energy affairs in the first Obama administration, stated, \"Our interest is the oil gets produced and Iraq makes money, so this is a big plus. Geopolitically it develops close links between China and Iraq, although China did not get into it for the politics. Now that they are there, they have a great stake in assuring the continuity of the regime that facilitates their investment.\"\n\nFor China, Iraq is one of several countries it increasingly relies on to sustain its growing economy. As the world's biggest oil importer, China is investing heavily in oil and gas fields globally, with $12 billion worth of investments in 2011, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Over half of its oil imports come from the Middle East, despite a decrease in imports from Iran in recent years. As China's energy consumption continues to grow, it is essential for the country to diversify its energy sources. Kevin Jianjun Tu, an expert on Chinese energy policies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, succinctly summarized, \"China needs more energy and needs to diversify its sources.\"\n\nThe Iraqi government, heavily dependent on oil revenues to finance its military and social programs, stands to benefit significantly from the investment. Iraq, currently OPEC's second-largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, aims to invest $30 billion annually to modernize its oil fields, pipelines, and refineries to reach production targets that will position it as a premier energy power for decades to come. The revenue generated from these investments could help alleviate tensions between the Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis or exacerbate them as competing factions vie for control of the resources.",
    " Title: The Challenges Facing President Obama in Rallying Public Support for U.S.-Led Airstrikes in Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to garner public support for U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria, President Barack Obama is set to conduct a media blitz, including interviews on six television networks and a primetime Oval Office address. However, a new article by George C. Edwards III, university distinguished professor of political science at Texas A&M University, suggests that this strategy is unlikely to sway the public's opinion.\n\nThe article, titled \"Why Obama's Syria Plea Won't Work,\" argues that even great communicators, such as past presidents like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan, typically failed to move the public to support their initiatives. The article cites examples such as Bill Clinton's inability to win public backing for his economic stimulus bill or his health-care reform proposal, as well as the public's resistance to Reagan's defense spending increases and his Nicaraguan aid policy.\n\nThe article further explains that the president faces strong competition for the public's attention, with barely a tenth of the population watching Obama's 2013 State of the Union address. Additionally, many people who do pay attention miss the president's points, and the less people know, the more confidence they have in their pre-existing beliefs. The article also highlights the role of partisanship, deep polarization, and the opposition's ability to undermine the White House's efforts to shape the narrative and present the president in a favorable light.\n\nThe article concludes that the president is unlikely to change many opinions, especially among Republicans, the core constituency of the House majority. The author suggests that the president might have better luck with his fellow Democrats, but even then, the world will not change on Tuesday, and the president is unlikely to substantially increase public support for military action against Syria. The article emphasizes that this is not because Obama is a pale shadow of great presidents of yore, but rather, it's just the way American politics really works.",
    " Title: FISA-Gate: A Modern Scandal Unveiled - A Comparison with Watergate and Iran-Contra\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, a new scandal has emerged, reminiscent of the Watergate and Iran-Contra affairs that rocked the nation in the past. Known as FISA-Gate, this scandal involves allegations of political manipulation, government overreach, and potential misuse of intelligence agencies during the Obama administration.\n\nThe FISA-Gate scandal revolves around the Department of Justice's (DOJ) pursuit of surveillance warrants for Carter Page, a Trump campaign associate, under the premise of collusion with Russian interests. However, it has been revealed that the basis for these warrant requests was an unverified dossier, partly funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign to discredit Donald Trump during the 2016 election.\n\nFurthermore, it has been alleged that government officials failed to disclose that the author of the dossier, Christopher Steele, had been dropped as a reliable source by the FBI due to leaking to the press, and that a DOJ official, Bruce Ohr, had met privately with Steele, and his wife, Nellie, had been involved in the dossier's creation.\n\nAdditionally, there are suspicions that members of the Obama administration's national security team may have requested the names of American citizens connected with the Trump campaign who were swept up in other FISA surveillance. These names may have been improperly unmasked and leaked to the media for political purposes during the campaign.\n\nAs a result, several high-ranking officials, including the deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, and FBI officials Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, have been reassigned or resigned due to their involvement in the scandal. The new FBI director, Christopher Wray, has also reassigned the FBI's top lawyer, James Baker, who is suspected of leaking the Steele dossier to a sympathetic journalist.\n\nThe FISA-Gate scandal raises concerns about the politicization of government agencies and the potential misuse of intelligence for political gain. The irony lies in the fact that, unlike the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals, the media and liberal civil libertarians are now opposing the disclosure of public documents, siding with those in the government who sought surveillance to facilitate the efforts of a political campaign.\n\nThis shift in perspective, with the roles reversed, has sparked debate about the nature of political scandals and the role of the media in uncovering and reporting on such controversies. As the investigation into FISA-Gate continues, it remains to be seen how this scandal will unfold and what long-term implications it may have for the future of American politics.",
    " Title: U.S. Strike on Syria: Potential Consequences and International Law Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe potential military action by the United States against Syria, in the face of widespread opposition from various countries and influential political and religious leaders, including the Pope, raises concerns about the potential for more innocent casualties and the escalation of the conflict, which could extend far beyond Syria's borders. A strike could intensify violence and foster a new wave of terrorism. It could disrupt multilateral efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, further destabilizing the Middle East and North Africa. Such an action could potentially disrupt the balance of international law and order.\n\nSyria is not experiencing a struggle for democracy, but rather an armed conflict between the government and opposition in a multi-religious country. Few champions of democracy can be found in Syria, but there are numerous Qaeda fighters and extremists of various ideologies fighting against the government. The U.S. State Department has designated Al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, fighting alongside the opposition, as terrorist organizations. This internal conflict, fueled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition, is one of the bloodiest in the world.\n\nMercenaries from Arab countries fighting there, and hundreds of militants from Western countries and even Russia, pose a significant concern. There is a risk that these individuals, having gained experience in Syria, may return to their home countries and potentially pose a threat. After all, extremists who fought in Libya moved on to Mali. This threatens us all.\n\nFrom the outset, Russia has advocated for peaceful dialogue, enabling Syrians to develop a compromise plan for their own future. Russia is not defending the Syrian government, but rather upholding international law. The use of the United Nations Security Council is advocated, as preserving law and order in today's complex and turbulent world is one of the few ways to prevent international relations from descending into chaos. The law is the law, and it must be adhered to, whether we like it or not. Under current international law, force is only permitted in self-defense or by the decision of the Security Council. Any other action would be unacceptable under the United Nations Charter and would constitute an act of aggression.\n\nThere is no doubt that poison gas was used in Syria. However, there is reason to believe it was used not by the Syrian Army, but by opposition forces, to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons, who would be siding with the fundamentalists. Reports that militants are preparing another attack\u2014this time against Israel\u2014cannot be ignored.",
    " Title: Democrats Celebrate as GOP Fails to Pass Healthcare Bill, Setting Precedent for Upcoming Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Republican Party failed to pass their high-stakes healthcare bill on Friday, marking a significant victory for the Democratic Party. House Speaker Paul Ryan announced the decision to abandon the bill after it failed to garner enough support from within the Republican Party, ensuring that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, would remain in place.\n\nThe news was met with immediate celebration from the Democratic side, with party members taking to social media and holding press conferences to express relief for the American public. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez stated, \"Today is a great day for our country. It's a victory. What happened on the floor is a victory for the American people.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters, \"In the words of my friend Joe Biden: This is a BFD.\" The failure of the Republican Party to uphold their campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare is expected to further embolden and amplify the Democratic Party, both in Congress and at the grassroots level.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-California, attributed the bill's downfall to Republican intra-party disagreement and the liberal movement that has been pushing back against the new Republican government since President Donald Trump's first day. Groups have actively been organizing phone and letter-writing campaigns to oppose the bill, and they've turned out in force at congressional town halls across the country.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated that the healthcare disaster sets a poor precedent for Republicans in the new Congress, adding that they're unlikely to have much luck with the president's budget plan. Schumer also hinted at an upcoming fight in the Senate over Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, with Democrats planning to filibuster and Republicans potentially changing the rules to end a filibuster with a simple majority.\n\nThe healthcare bill fiasco could give Democrats some momentum as they head into the week, but its impact on the Gorsuch nomination is unclear. In a sobering press conference, Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged the Republican setback, stating, \"I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us. Doing big things is hard.\"\n\nRepublicans are now facing an uphill battle in next year's midterm elections, with one senior GOP official telling CNN, \"2018 will be tough.\" The Democratic Party is already targeting Republicans who voted in favor of the bill during the legislative process, with Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the House Democratic campaign arm, forecasting which Republicans they could start targeting.\n\nIn the aftermath of the healthcare bill's failure, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, urged House Republicans to \"reflect and be a little bit humble.\" He suggested that if Republicans want to do something constructive, they should work with the Democrats to improve the Affordable Care Act. However, McGovern also warned that if Republicans continue to play politics or do nothing, it could be detrimental to their future success.",
    " Title: President Trump's Response to Charlottesville Unrest: A Call for Clarity and Unity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the violent events in Charlottesville, President Donald Trump has been faced with a unique challenge in addressing the complex issue of white supremacist terrorism. While condemning the violence on all sides, his initial response was criticized for its ambiguity.\n\nPresident Trump's original statement, which denounced \"violence on many sides,\" has been met with criticism, as it was perceived as a lack of clear condemnation of the white supremacist movement involved in the Charlottesville incident. The president's subsequent statement, issued by an anonymous White House aide, was a half-hearted expansion of the original statement, but it still fell short of a direct and unequivocal denunciation of white supremacist terrorism.\n\nWhile it is true that there has been violence on both sides during the current season of protest, it is crucial to recognize that the violence in Charlottesville was an act of terrorism, conducted under the auspices of a white-supremacist movement that has embraced terrorism and political violence. It is important for President Trump to join other political leaders in labeling this event as such.\n\nThe president's base, which includes some who have flirted with white supremacist ideologies, may view his tepid response as a tacit endorsement of their beliefs. However, it is essential for the president to make it clear where he stands, and to treat the Charlottesville white supremacists with the same specificity with which he denounces other political adversaries.\n\nThe president has a unique platform to set an example and to promote unity in the face of division. We urge President Trump to live up to this responsibility and to denounce white supremacist terrorism in a clear and unequivocal manner.\n\nWe also call on all responsible parties, on both sides of the political spectrum, to be honest about what is happening and to unequivocally condemn acts of violence and terrorism. The president has a special responsibility to set an example, and we hope that he will use his platform to promote unity and to denounce white supremacist terrorism in a clear and unequivocal manner."
