    " Title: Activists Prepare for Intense Battle Over Supreme Court Nominee and Abortion Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - The confirmation process for the next Supreme Court justice is expected to be a contentious battle, as demonstrated by the early mobilization of abortion rights activists. Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collins (R-ME), are being targeted by these activists due to their potential opposition to the nominee and their pro-choice stance.\n\nThe National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL) has been actively engaging with 10,000 activists this week, discussing the potential threats to abortion rights. NARAL President Ilyse Hogue stated, \"We know\u2014and we know for sure\u2014that any of Trump's list of 25 will vote to decimate our rights under Roe v. Wade. Period.\"\n\nNARAL has made it clear that they will target senators who vote to confirm the nominee. Ilyse Hogue tweeted, \"When voting on a #SCOTUS nominee, senators need to examine their values and their moral compasses. And if they do not, then they need to examine their political futures.\"\n\nIndivisible, a group established in opposition to President Donald Trump, is also rallying its members. The group has set up a hotline to connect people with their senators and created a script for callers to read.\n\nAbortion is not the only driving issue behind the protests. Groups in support of Obamacare are also gearing up for the fight, with Protect Our Care warning that the new justice could be a deciding vote that gets rid of protections for pre-existing conditions.\n\nHowever, activists face a challenge, as three Democratic senators may also break ranks with their party to join Republicans in voting to confirm the president's nominee. Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), and Joe Donnelly (D-IN) all voted to confirm the president's first Supreme Court pick, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and all three are seeking re-election in states that President Trump won in 2016.\n\nIt's also important to note that the nominee's stance on issues may not be as predictable as assumed. Justice Anthony Kennedy, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, was described as a conservative but only held conservative views about half of the time. Similarly, Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by President George W. Bush, has issued some rulings on the high court that make many conservatives cringe.\n\nRegardless, senators can expect a summer filled with activist-filled lobbies, protests, and threats against their political futures as they weigh their votes for or against the next justice of the Supreme Court.",
    " Title: Maryland Lawmakers Propose Replacing Roger Taney's Bust in U.S. Capitol with Thurgood Marshall\n\nArticle:\n\nMaryland lawmakers have introduced legislation to replace a bust of Chief Justice Roger Taney, who authored the Dred Scott decision, in the old Supreme Court chamber of the U.S. Capitol. The proposed replacement is Baltimore native Thurgood Marshall, the first justice of African descent on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe debate to install Taney's bust in the Capitol building occurred over a century ago, with controversy surrounding Taney's role in upholding the institution of slavery. George Templeton Strong, a contemporary, wrote upon Taney's passing, \"the Hon. old Roger B. Taney has earned the gratitude of his country by dying at last. Better late than never.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, Taney's bust remained undisturbed in the Capitol for 143 years. Even the Maryland statehouse removed their tribute to Taney. Now, Maryland's senators, with backing from the Democratic members of the Maryland House delegation, are proposing to replace Taney's bust with a bust of Thurgood Marshall.\n\nThurgood Marshall's legacy as an attorney, Johnson administration official, and Supreme Court justice is significant, and his tribute in the Capitol is warranted. However, replacing Taney's bust with Marshall's would underscore the significance of Marshall's enshrinement, as he was the first justice of African descent, while Taney is known for his role in upholding slavery.\n\nThe bill, if successful, would provide a fitting closure to Maryland's place in the old chamber. The replacement of Taney's bust with Marshall's would symbolize the progress made in the fight for civil rights and equality.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun reported on the proposed legislation, with Joe Patrice, a senior editor at \u2588\u2588\u2588 and co-host of Thinking Like A Lawyer, commenting on the bill. Patrice serves as a Managing Director at RPN Executive Search.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader McConnell Urges Roy Moore to Step Aside Amid Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has called for Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to step aside from the upcoming Senate race, following allegations of inappropriate relationships with teenagers. The December election is to replace former Senator Jeff Sessions, who stepped down to become President Trump's attorney general.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a plant in Kentucky, McConnell expressed his belief in the women who have made the allegations against Moore. He also mentioned that he is exploring other Republican options for the seat, including incumbent Luther Strange, who lost a primary to Moore earlier this year. McConnell suggested the possibility of a write-in campaign for an alternative candidate.\n\nRoy Moore, who has vehemently denied the allegations, reported by the Washington Post last week, has stated that he \"has not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone\" and has never purchased alcohol for underage women. The allegations include claims by Leigh Corfman, who was 14 when Moore, then 32, allegedly took her to his home in 1979, undressed her, and, according to the report, \"touched her over her bra and underpants... and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear.\" Another woman, Gloria Deason, claimed she was 18 when Moore took her on a date and bought her wine.\n\nMoore and his GOP allies in Alabama have questioned the timing of the story, suggesting it was planted to derail his political career. In response to McConnell's statement, Moore took to Twitter on Monday, saying the Senate Majority Leader should step aside.\n\nAdditional reporting:\n- GOP Sen. Pat Toomey says Roy Moore should drop out of Alabama Senate race\n- Roy Moore questions timing of allegations, says \"revelations about motivations\" coming.",
    " Title: Increased Incidents of Political Intimidation and Violence Against Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent times, incidents of violence and intimidation against Republican politicians and their supporters have become more prevalent in a politically charged climate.\n\nOn Thursday, a woman in Tennessee was charged with felony reckless endangerment for allegedly attempting to run Republican Congressman David Kustoff off the road following a town hall meeting. The woman, Wendi Wright, was reportedly enraged over Kustoff's support for the American Health Care Act and screamed at the congressman and his aide, striking his car windows and reaching inside the vehicle.\n\nOn the same day, police in North Dakota escorted an enraged man from another town hall after he became physical with Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer over his support for the GOP Obamacare replacement. The man, before shoving cash down Cramer's collar, shouted, \"Will the rich benefit from [the health care being destroyed], do the rich get a tax break? Yes or no?\"\n\nCNN's Poppy Harlow downplayed the incident, stating the man was \"showing his disgust\" with Cramer.\n\nThe day before, a Huffington Post article titled \"How to Really Turn Up the Heat on Elected Officials\" went viral. The author, Michaelangelo Signorile, called on protesters to harass Republicans at dinner, while shopping, and even at home. Signorile argued that societal norms for the basic levels of decency one should afford political opponents no longer apply to liberals.\n\n\"It's time to move beyond polite protests within specified boundaries. It's time to escalate the expression of our outrage and our anger in a massive way,\" he wrote.\n\nSignorile's article has already been shared more than 29,000 times.\n\nPolitical violence has become increasingly common as left-wing organizations have incited mobs against Republicans and supporters of the president. A popular parade in Portland, Oregon was cancelled after threats of violence against a local Republican organization. An email warning parade organizers promised 200 or more protesters would rush into the parade and drag the Republican marchers out if necessary. Portland has been a site for organized left-wing protests, which have often turned into violent riots.\n\nThe threat was sent from an email address registered with RiseUp.Net, an organization that provides communication and computer resources to allies engaged in struggles against capitalism and other forms of oppression.\n\nBerkeley, California has become a political battlefield on multiple occasions, after far-left groups have resorted to violence to keep Pro-Trump speakers or free speech marchers, who happened to be Trump supporters, from appearing in public.\n\nPro-Trump speaker Milo Yiannopoulos had his speech at the University of California-Berkeley cancelled after rioters set the campus ablaze to keep him from speaking. Protests against Milo at UC Berkeley resulted in chants of \"This is what community looks like.\"\n\nPolitical commentator Ann Coulter, who staunchly supported Trump during his presidential campaign, had her speech at UC Berkeley cancelled after the protest groups vowed a repeat performance of the Milo riots.\n\nA North Carolina GOP office was firebombed a month before the election, and a building adjacent to it was spray-painted with graffiti: \"Nazi Republicans get out of town or else.\"\n\nBeing a Republican in high school or college is increasingly dangerous\u2014and not just at Berkeley.\n\nShortly before the election, a female high school student was attacked after declaring her support for Trump. A fellow female student took the girl's glasses off and punched her in the face, saying, \"Fuck you, you bitch.\"\n\nOlivia Corn, president of Cornell University's College Republicans, said she was physically assaulted the night after Trump won the election. \"Fuck you, racist bitch, you support a racist party,\" her attacker reportedly said. Ironically, Corn said she was \"not Donald Trump's biggest fan,\" and added that she \"was saddened that I was not afforded the same respect that I offer others.\"\n\nA Maryland high school student wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat after the election was punched and kicked by students protesting Trump after he started arguing with them.\n\nSimilarly, police in Florida arrested a 17-year-old high school student after he punched a classmate for carrying a Trump sign at school.\n\n\"It definitely had a political motivation,\" said Lt. Mike Bandish of the Palm Bay Police Department. \"The boy was carrying a Trump sign and walked into the gym. The other boy punched him in the face.\"",
    " Title: White House Criticizes CNN and MSNBC for Cutting Away from Coronavirus Briefing\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has criticized CNN and MSNBC for cutting away from Monday evening's coronavirus briefing led by President Donald Trump and his administration. White House spokesman Judd Deere described the networks' actions as \"disgraceful\" for not airing the entire White House briefing during the ongoing pandemic.\n\nIn a tweet, Deere stated, \"Pretty disgraceful that @ CNN and @ MSNBC have both cut away from this @ WhiteHouse briefing with @ realDonaldTrump and @ Mike_Pence during a global pandemic. Thank you to @FoxNews for keeping Americans informed.\"\n\nFox News also cut away from the briefing but only just before it ended. In response to Deere's tweet, a CNN spokesperson issued a statement, \"If the White House wants time on the network, they should make an official request. Otherwise, we will make our own editorial decisions.\"\n\nAn MSNBC network spokesperson said the network aired the briefing for more than an hour before cutting away \"because the information no longer appeared to be valuable to the important ongoing discussion around public health.\"\n\nSeveral individuals have criticized the administration's daily coronavirus briefings for allegedly spreading misinformation, and some have urged news networks not to show them live. Last week, President Trump got into a spat with NBC News reporter Peter Alexander when he asked what the president's message is to Americans who are \"scared\" about the coronavirus.\n\nIn Monday's briefing, Trump indicated that he wants to work with local economies to \"cautiously resume\" activities after the pandemic has shut down industries.\n\nAs of Monday, COVID-19 has infected more than 43,000 people in the U.S., leading to at least 552 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Calls for Gun-Control Debate in Response to Connecticut School Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the deadly shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, which left 20 children and six adults dead, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has called for a gun-control debate in Congress. Reid, who has previously voted against gun-control measures, controls whether the Senate will take up any legislation that could be sent to the House of Representatives.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Reid said, \"In the coming days and weeks, we will engage in a meaningful conversation and thoughtful debate about how to change laws and culture that allow violence to grow.\" This was the first time lawmakers convened since the shooting.\n\nThe shooting incident involved a semi-automatic rifle and two semi-automatic handguns, as well as hundreds of rounds of ammunition, according to police. The shooter, identified as Adam Lanza, also killed his mother at their home.\n\nIn the days since the shooting, calls for action have come from all directions, including lawmakers who previously fought more restrictions. Sen. Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat, said, \"Everything should be on the table.\"\n\nSen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, who has a pro-gun stance, has changed his position on so-called assault weapons following the Newtown incident. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg plans to reintroduce a bill that bans magazines with the capacity of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition, while Sen. Dianne Feinstein will introduce a bill to ban assault weapons. Congress passed such a ban in 1994 that lapsed in 2004.\n\nSome, however, doubted more restrictions would work and called for increasing access to guns for teachers to prevent such attacks. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas expressed a similar sentiment, wishing Sandy Hook Principal Dawn Hochsprung, who was fatally shot while lunging at the shooter, had access to a firearm.\n\nReid's vow to hold a gun debate could free up the necessary time to bring a bill to the Senate floor, where the last major gun debate was in 2004. Reid has been a supporter of gun rights, including voting against renewal of the assault-weapons ban during that debate.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, promised to lead hearings on the status of laws, but said other Senate committees need to step up and look at other issues such as mental health concerns. The White House has pledged to engage citizens in an effort to prevent more tragedies like this, but has yet to specify the legislative measures it will support.",
    " Title: Political Divisions Surround Tara Reade's Allegation Against Joe Biden and Comparisons to Trump's Sexual Assault Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political landscape is currently divided over the allegation made by Tara Reade, a former staffer for Joe Biden, that he sexually assaulted her. Some critics have accused liberal feminists of hypocrisy for not championing Reade as fervently as they did Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault during his Supreme Court nomination fight.\n\nThe New York Times article attempts to address the inevitable calculus voters will have to make in November by providing a thorough accounting of the \"pattern of behavior\" laid out by the more than 20 women who have accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment or assault. The article suggests that the allegations against Trump go \"far beyond the accusations against Mr. Biden.\"\n\nIt is not wrong to consider how a sexual assault allegation might affect a political candidate's chances. However, the article's comparison of the sexual assault allegations against Biden and Trump is criticized for engaging in an obfuscating exercise of relativity.\n\nRegarding Biden's policy plan, critics note that his response to young people demanding a better health policy is to offer a policy that won't help them for decades. Some argue that Biden's plan, which doesn't lower the Medicare eligibility age significantly, shows that he isn't serious about courting the left.\n\nOn the other hand, some argue that young voters' inability to deliver on their preferred candidate's behalf will not go unnoticed in political circles. They suggest that young voters need to show up and be counted like never before to establish themselves as a reliable force in political circles.\n\nIn conclusion, the political landscape is divided over Tara Reade's allegation against Joe Biden and the comparisons to Donald Trump's sexual assault allegations. Critics argue that Biden's policy plan does not go far enough to address the concerns of young voters, while others argue that young voters need to show up and be counted to establish themselves as a reliable force in political circles.",
    " Title: Billionaire Tom Steyer's Role in Delaying Keystone XL Pipeline\n\nArticle:\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer, a prominent Democrat and hedge fund manager, has been identified as a key figure in the delay of the Keystone XL pipeline, a proposed oil pipeline extension. Steyer, who is based in California and New York, has been a vocal opponent of the project and has funded a series of television ads to persuade the public that the pipeline is not in the nation's best interest.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Steyer spent $11 million during the 2014 elections to support Terry McAuliffe's gubernatorial campaign in Virginia and intervened in a Democratic congressional primary in Massachusetts. Now, he is seeking to build a war chest for his political organization, NextGen Climate Action, which aims to focus on climate change issues. Steyer is reportedly seeking to raise $50 million from other donors to match his own $50 million investment.\n\nSteyer's efforts have attracted the support of other deep-pocketed donors and environmental philanthropists, with the goal of making NextGen Climate Action one of the largest outside groups in the country. In early February, Steyer gathered several leading liberal donors and environmental philanthropists at his ranch in California to discuss his plans.\n\nSteyer's campaign against the Keystone XL pipeline has not been limited to Republicans. In March, NextGen Climate Action asked supporters to choose one congressional candidate from five running this year for the group to target in its next ads. Four of the five candidates were Republicans, including Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. However, the fifth candidate was a vulnerable Democratic incumbent, Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, who has close ties to the oil and gas industries and has been an outspoken supporter of the Keystone pipeline.\n\nIt is unclear whether Steyer's campaign will focus solely on attacking Republicans or also target non-true-believing Democrats. The new fundraising push seeks to tap into the booming fortunes of Silicon Valley, where many donors rank climate change as their top political issue. The shift in donations from philanthropy and education into campaign vehicles designed to win elections is a sign of frustration among donors that neither Democratic nor Republican officials are prioritizing climate change measures.",
    " Title: Democratic-Leaning States Face Significant Tax Cuts in Republican Tax Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic-leaning states are set to bear a substantial portion of the tax cuts unveiled in a Republican tax plan on Thursday, as the plan reduces deductions that are most commonly used by residents of states that voted against Donald Trump in the 2016 elections. The bill, introduced by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means on Thursday, targets state and local tax deductions as part of its plan to offset reductions in taxes elsewhere.\n\nThe bill eliminates the most widely-used deduction, income tax, and caps property tax deductions, the second most-used, at $10,000. State and local deductions are used primarily by high-tax states that tend to vote Democratic in presidential elections, and local officials say the tax bill appears to divide its benefits and burdens along partisan lines.\n\nKevin Sullivan, Connecticut's Commissioner of Revenue Services, stated, \"I do think this has been developed in a way that looks at who were the prevailing forces in the presidential election and who were not.\" Connecticut, along with several other high-tax Democratic states, is expected to see middle-class households paying more taxes under the Republican plan.\n\nAmong the states potentially hardest-hit are California and New York, with state income tax rates of 13.3% and 8.82%, respectively, according to a recent report by the Tax Foundation. This group also includes New Jersey, Minnesota, and Oregon - all of which voted for Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 election.\n\nBy contrast, out of the seven states that levy no income tax, Trump only lost Washington and Nevada, while winning Alaska, Florida, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat and one of the most outspoken opponents of the bill, wrote in a letter to Trump this week, \"By eliminating or rolling back state and local tax deductibility, Washington is sending a death blow to New York's middle class families and our economy.\"\n\nThe legislation would also end a tax exemption for billions of dollars of so-called private activity bonds issued by state and local governments annually to finance affordable housing, non-profit hospitals, colleges, airports, and port facilities - a measure that would affect both Democrat and Republican states alike.\n\nConservative groups have defended the tax bill, stating it would simplify the tax code, reduce the overall burden on the economy, and spread the costs and burdens more fairly.\n\nJonathan Williams, chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization of conservative state legislators, said in an email, \"The principles outlined in this federal tax reform effort will provide pro-growth tax rate reductions, while adding fairness and simplicity to the tax code.\"\n\nNick Samuels, a senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service, said the proposed bill would hit primarily high-income and high-tax states like California, New York, and New Jersey, making it harder for them to raise revenue from income and property taxes.\n\nOfficials in the affected states say millions of residents, not just high-earners, would suffer due to lost tax breaks and less funding available for public services. In New Jersey, 1.8 million households deduct a total of $17 billion in state income or sales taxes, and 1.6 million households deduct a cumulative $14.9 billion in local property taxes from their federal taxes, according to the nonpartisan think-tank New Jersey Policy Perspective.\n\nJon Whiten, the group's vice president, stated, \"This deal is still terrible for New Jersey's working families, with big tax breaks that overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest 1 percent, setting up deep cuts to programs and services that we all rely on.\"\n\nMinnesota's Democratic Governor Mark Dayton warned on Monday that the legislation would eliminate tax deductions totaling over $12.3 billion annually for 900,000 families in his state.\n\nThe states with the highest property tax collections per capita include New Jersey, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and New York, according to the Tax Foundation. For California, approximately one in three residents took a state or local deduction in 2015, totaling roughly $113 billion, according to H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the state's finance department.\n\n\"Congress is trying to rush consideration of a tax proposal that will have profound and widespread impacts on California,\" Palmer said.\n\nNational Conference of State Legislatures President and Republican South Dakota state senator Deb Peters, in a statement, called the legislation \"an attack on the sovereignty of states.\"",
    " Title: Trump Jr. Turns Over Thousands of Documents to Congress in Ongoing Investigations\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney for Donald Trump Jr., Alan Futerfas, has stated that they have cooperated with various committees and voluntarily handed over thousands of documents in response to their requests. The documents were provided as part of Congress' ongoing investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe correspondence, though representing a small portion of the documents, has raised questions due to its connection with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and the White House's response to the Russian meddling. The messages have added a second instance where Trump Jr. appears eager to obtain damaging information about Hillary Clinton, despite its provenance.\n\nIt is unclear what investigators will make of the correspondence. The stakes for the Trump family are high, as Trump Jr.'s June 2016 meeting with Veselnitskaya and the White House's defense of him are already reportedly subjects of interest in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nTrump Jr. mostly ignored the frequent messages from WikiLeaks, but he at times appears to have acted on its requests. For instance, when WikiLeaks first reached out to Trump Jr. about putintrump.org, Trump Jr. followed up on his promise to \"ask around.\" On the same day that Trump Jr. received the first message from WikiLeaks, he emailed other senior officials with the Trump campaign, including Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale, and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, telling them WikiLeaks had made contact. Kushner then forwarded the email to campaign communications staffer Hope Hicks. At no point during the 10-month correspondence does Trump Jr. rebuff WikiLeaks, which had published stolen documents and was already observed to be releasing information that benefited Russian interests.\n\nWikiLeaks did not respond to requests for comment.",
    " Title: Clinton Faces Challenges in Uniting Democratic Party After Primary Victory\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of her victory in the New York primary, Hillary Clinton faces the challenge of uniting the Democratic Party, particularly the Sanders wing. During her victory speech, Clinton acknowledged the need for unity, stating, \"To all the people who supported Senator Sanders, I believe there is much more that unites us than divides us.\"\n\nClinton has several options to address this issue. She could offer Sanders a prime-time speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention, select a vice president who shares Sanders' concerns, emulate John F. Kennedy's decision to make his primary rival, Lyndon Baines Johnson, his running mate in 1960, or incorporate Sanders' positions into the Democratic Party platform. If Sanders ends up with a campaign debt, Clinton could also promise to help pay it off, as President Obama did for her in 2008.\n\nHowever, Clinton's efforts to appeal to Sanders' voters may be complicated by her potential shift back to the political center in preparation for the general election. This move could alienate Sanders' voters, who are already skeptical of Clinton.\n\nA more significant challenge is whether Sanders, who has not always identified as a Democrat and has shown reservations towards Clinton, will wholeheartedly endorse her if she secures the nomination. Howard Dean, who lost the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 to John Kerry, noted that endorsing a candidate is easier than convincing supporters to follow suit. \"It's much easier for the candidate to understand that he or she has to get with the program,\" said Dean, who supports Clinton. \"I had made up my mind that I was going to support John, but bringing supporters along was much tougher.\"",
    " Title: Majority of Americans View Relationship Between Trump Administration and News Media as Unhealthy, Impeding Access to Political News\n\nArticle:\n\nThe relationship between the Trump administration and the news media is, according to most U.S. adults, problematic. A new survey conducted by \u2588\u2588\u2588 from March 13-27, 2017, among 4,151 adults who are members of \u2588\u2588\u2588's nationally representative American Trends Panel, reveals that 83% of Americans believe the current tensions have made the relationship between the administration and the news media unhealthy, with only 15% saying it is healthy despite current tensions.\n\nFurthermore, 73% of U.S. adults believe these tensions are getting in the way of access to important national political news and information. This concern is shared across nearly all demographic groups, including large majorities of both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe findings show that 88% of Democrats and 78% of Republicans view the relationship as unhealthy. Additionally, about seven-in-ten members of both parties say access to important political news is impacted. The findings are similarly consistent across other demographic groups such as age, race, income, and education.\n\nAwareness of the current state of the relationship between the Trump administration and the news media is virtually ubiquitous in America, with 94% of U.S. adults saying they have heard about it. Younger Americans are less likely to have heard a lot about the relationship, with 55% of adults ages 18-29 saying they've heard a lot compared with 71% of those 30-49, 77% of those 50-64, and 86% of those 65 and older.\n\nThe survey does not provide insight into who Americans blame for these tensions or what actions they want taken. However, it is clear that they currently have high levels of awareness and concern.",
    " Title: New York City Businesses Struggle with Minimum Wage Increase\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York City businesses, which have been mandated to pay a minimum wage of $15 per hour for over a year, are reportedly experiencing negative impacts and making difficult adjustments, according to The Wall Street Journal. Businesses with 11 or more employees were required to pay the increased wage at the beginning of 2019.\n\nThomas Green, president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce, has observed an increase in small businesses closing this year due to the wage increase. \"They're cutting their staff,\" Green said. \"They're cutting their hours. They're shutting down. It's not just the rent.\"\n\nThe minimum wage increase is particularly challenging for businesses located in boroughs with less disposable income, according to Lisa Sorin, president of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce. While Manhattan businesses might be able to handle the increase, places like the Bronx are forced to \"keep up or get out.\"\n\nEven for businesses not forced to close due to the minimum wage increase, it can stifle growth. Susannah Koteen, who owns a restaurant in Harlem, told WSJ that she had to cancel plans to move her business to a larger location because she could not afford the risk of having to hire more staff in an unpredictable industry.\n\n\"You would just have no choice but to cut people at the bottom,\" Koteen said.\n\nThese anecdotes illustrate the reality that while most people may believe workers deserve higher wages in theory, the practical implications of a higher minimum wage can be extremely damaging to minimum wage employees who may lose job opportunities and small business owners who are already operating with tight margins.\n\nJohn Bonizio, who owns four Metro Optics Eyewear locations in the city, said, \"As a retailer, I was not opposed to the minimum-wage increase because it puts more money or more disposable income into the pockets of people who are my customers. But, what you have to stop doing, is picking the pockets of small businesses.\"",
    " Title: Nike's Controversy Over Betsy Ross Flag: Historical Context and Political Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Nike has faced controversy over a sneaker design featuring an early version of the American flag, prompting the company to halt its distribution. The controversy stems from former NFL player Colin Kaepernick's reported objection to the design, which some perceive as tied to slavery. However, the relationship between the Betsy Ross flag and white supremacy is not universally agreed upon among historians.\n\nThe 13-star flag, America's first, is often attributed to Philadelphia seamstress Betsy Ross, although historical confirmation of this lore is lacking. Betsy Ross lived during the era of slavery, but the flag's connection to white supremacy is not immediately clear, according to a number of historians contacted by the source. The political leanings of Ross are unknown, as Philadelphia, with its large Quaker population, had neutral leanings during the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe Betsy Ross flag is not included in the Anti-Defamation League's (ADL) database of more than 150 so-called hate symbols, such as the Confederate flag, a noose, Pepe the Frog, and Sadistic Souls. Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow at ADL's Center on Extremism, noted that while the flag has been used by white supremacists \"from time to time,\" he has \"never once thought about\" adding the Betsy Ross flag to the list.\n\nThe Betsy Ross flag has caused controversy before, such as in 2016 when students at a majority white high school in Michigan waved the 13-star flag during a football game, while holding \"Make America Great Again\" flags in support of President Donald Trump. The NAACP's local chapter at the time stated that Ross's flag had been \"co-opted by exclusionary movements.\"\n\nNike's decision to pull the sneakers was intended to avoid offense, but it also opened the company up to political rebuke and jeopardized potential financial incentives to add a manufacturing facility in Arizona. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey criticized Nike's decision on Twitter, stating that the company had \"apparently decided that Betsy Ross is unworthy\" and had \"bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism.\"\n\nThe Betsy Ross flag was formally commemorated on June 14, 1777, when the U.S. passed a law creating Flag Day. The legislation reads: \"Resolved. That the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new Constellation.\" The flag has evolved since its earliest iteration, adding more stars as more states joined the union.\n\nScott P. Marler, associate professor of history at the University of Memphis, stated that \"since patriot groups, militias, etc., tend to be firmly linked to '100% (white) Americanism,' the rumor has now taken root that the Ross flag constitutes another such symbol (like the Confederate flag).\" Marler lamented, \"Well, if it wasn't before, it sure will be now, and it's a shame to concede it to them.\"\n\nNike shares closed down less than 1% in trading Tuesday afternoon, having risen about 8% over the past 12 months.",
    " Title: Law Professor Pamela Karlan's Testimony Sparks Controversy Over Alleged Personal Attacks\n\n Article:\n\n In the ongoing impeachment hearings, law professor Pamela Karlan's testimony has sparked controversy over allegations of personal attacks, particularly towards President Donald Trump's son, Barron Trump. Critics argue that her comments disqualify her as an expert witness due to the demonstration of strong personal animus against Trump.\n\n During the proceedings, Karlan made a comment about the difference between a president and a king, stating that the U.S. Constitution prohibits titles of nobility, and while the president can name his son Barron, he cannot make him a baron.\n\n The article suggests that leftist academics, including Karlan, are prone to expressing such insults publicly due to their ideological bubbles and the perceived lack of backlash from their peers. The piece also references several instances of controversial comments made by prominent Democrats, such as Hillary Clinton's \"deplorables\" remark and former FBI agent Peter Strzok's derogatory texts about Trump supporters.\n\n The article further discusses the theory of evolutionary psychologist Dr. Nigel Barber, who posits that conservatives have a predisposition to fear and a distaste for complexity and compromise, which may contribute to political polarization. The article argues that this theory is reminiscent of Karlan's comments about conservatives and liberals.\n\n The article concludes by suggesting that the left's animosity towards Trump and his supporters is driven by an elitist attitude and a pre-ordained decision to impeach President Trump, a sentiment that predates his term in office. The article also criticizes the left for their hypocrisy in advocating for Trump's ouster while pretending to safeguard constitutional liberties. The author, David Limbaugh, is a writer, author, and attorney, and his latest book is \"Guilty by Reason of Insanity: Why the Democrats Must Not Win.\"",
    " Title: California Primary: \"Zombie Votes\" and Potential Implications for Remaining Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nAs California polls close tonight, the first batch of votes to be counted will consist of the more than 3.7 million ballots already mailed in, which may include \"zombie votes\" for candidates who have ended their presidential campaigns. These votes are not for actual zombies but rather votes cast for candidates who have withdrawn from the race.\n\nAccording to Paul Mitchell, an electoral researcher from Political Data Inc., between 350,000 to 400,000 Californians have already voted by mail for a candidate who has dropped out, and he suspects that number could grow to over half a million.\n\nMost voters appear to have waited until the last minute to cast their ballots. Although more than 16 million Californians received a mail ballot, less than a quarter of those ballots had been returned by the eve of the election.\n\nSince these ballots only need to be postmarked by tomorrow and arrive by Friday to be counted, officials are preparing for potential problems and delays in determining the final outcome in close races. This is one reason some advocated voting ahead of time, a strategy campaigns also urged to secure early support and a strong showing in the early vote tabulations.\n\nHowever, many who voted early for candidates like Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Andrew Yang, or Tom Steyer may now regret their choices, as these candidates have dropped out of the race. California has no provision for changing one's mind after a vote is cast and mailed in.\n\nThe implications of these \"zombie votes\" could affect the number of delegates remaining candidates will be allotted. Party rules dictate that a candidate must earn 15% of the statewide vote to get any statewide delegates, and also that a candidate must earn 15% of the vote in any of the state's congressional districts to receive any delegates apportioned at the district level.\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario, Mitchell suggested that Michael Bloomberg could potentially exceed the 15% threshold due to \"zombie votes\" from candidates who have dropped out, causing other candidates to miss the 15% threshold.\n\nIt is also possible that a candidate who has dropped out will still exceed the threshold enough to win some delegates in certain congressional districts. These delegates would be chosen by the ex-candidate and expected to vote for them on the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nAs for the anticipated flood of same-day voting, either in person or by mail, it is difficult to say which candidate stands to benefit most. Joe Biden, for instance, has been buoyed by a robust victory in the South Carolina primary and a stream of quitting candidates who have endorsed him. Californians who didn't vote early may be swayed by all that good news for Biden.\n\nConversely, the former vice president lost that momentum among all the Californians who have already voted by mail at a time when he trailed other contenders.\n\nHeading into the final hours of the California primary, the latest available public polls still indicated Bernie Sanders with a significant lead.

    " Title: Green Party's Jill Stein Criticizes Two Major Parties, Seeks to Break \"Stranglehold\" in 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, Green Party candidate Jill Stein, a 66-year-old Harvard-trained physician from Massachusetts, has expressed her disapproval of both major party candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Stein, who is currently polling at approximately 2 percent, trails Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, who is projected to take about 4 percent of the popular vote.\n\nDuring an interview last week, Stein stated, \"We have every reason to be terrified of Donald Trump in the White House. But I do not think we should fool ourselves into thinking that we should sleep well at night with Hillary Clinton in the White House either. They're both dangerous and unacceptable in different ways.\"\n\nStein believes that this election year presents an historic opportunity for third parties, stating, \"This is a realignment election. And you have this marriage of the Democratic and Republican parties now. And it's important, I think, for Greens and Libertarians to be working together right now to just break through this stranglehold and be challenging them right out of the gate.\"\n\nStein and Johnson share similar views on topics such as foreign policy, marijuana legalization, and same-sex marriage. However, their economic policies differ significantly. Stein advocates for a single-payer health care system, claiming it would cost taxpayers nothing. She also proposes pouring federal money into the clean energy sector and ending the use of fossil fuels by the year 2030.\n\nStein has faced criticism regarding her stance on vaccinations, with some claiming the Green Party is anti-vaccine. In response to small amounts of mercury once found in childhood vaccines, Stein has stated, \"There were real questions that needed to be addressed. I think some of them at least have been addressed. I do not know if all of them have been addressed.\" This statement has been met with controversy, as there is a scientific consensus that there is no link between vaccines and autism or any other serious health problems.\n\nStein characterizes the media coverage of her statements as misleading and compares it to the \"birther\" issue of the election, claiming she is only calling for reforms to the FDA, which she sees as corrupted by lobbyists.\n\nWith the election just days away, both Johnson and Stein's poll numbers are declining. Achieving 5 percent of the popular vote would be a significant milestone for both parties, as it would lead to the Federal Election Commission conferring the classification of \"minor party,\" granting them easier ballot access and eligibility for matching public funds.\n\nStein expressed her discontent with the current state of the election, stating, \"It's outrageous that people should be struggling right now with this question of, 'Do I prefer a fascist or a warmonger?'\"\n\nThe interview was conducted by Zach Weissmueller, produced and edited by Justin Monticello and Jim Epstein, and filmed by Monticello and Alex Manning. The music was composed by RW Smith.",
    " Title: Iran Tensions and the 2020 Elections: An Analysis of Foreign Policy's Potential Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent American-ordered drone strike that resulted in the death of Iran's powerful military leader, Qassem Soleimani, has sparked retaliation from Iran and heightened the alert status of American troops in the Middle East. This event has also brought foreign policy to the forefront of the news cycle, leading to speculation about its potential impact on the 2020 primary and general elections.\n\nWhile foreign policy typically does not significantly affect people's votes, this Iran episode could be an exception due to its prominence in the national conversation and the contrasting foreign policy positions of the major parties. However, the role international affairs play in primaries is not well-studied, especially in relation to experienced foreign policy candidates.\n\nIn the current Democratic primary, former Vice President Joe Biden is such a candidate, and two recent polls suggest that Democratic primary voters trust him the most on foreign policy. According to CNN, nearly half (48%) of Democrats and Democratic leaners said they thought Biden could best handle foreign policy, with Sen. Bernie Sanders coming in second place with 14%. In a poll taken immediately after the strike that killed Soleimani, HuffPost/YouGov found that 62% of Democrats and Democratic leaners trust Biden on Iran, although Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren weren't too far behind, with 47% trusting each of them (respondents were allowed to select multiple candidates they trusted).\n\nThe candidates' positions on Iran could also be determinative. A candidate like Sanders, who has been critical of Biden's vote to go to war with Iraq, could gain an advantage if the primary becomes a question of who is the most anti-war. The candidates' statements about Iran during the upcoming debate could be a make-or-break moment for many of the candidates, as foreign policy can serve as a litmus test that all serious candidates must pass.\n\nIn the 2016 Republican primaries, for example, Ben Carson may have flunked such a test when he struggled to articulate his plan to combat terrorism after the coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015. Although it's impossible to know exactly how much this hurt Carson in voters' eyes, he had been running even with now-President Trump in the polls at the time of the attacks, but he sharply declined thereafter and ceased to be a serious threat for the nomination.\n\nHowever, Iran's effect on the primary might be fleeting, as news cycles move on, and past events touted as \"game changers\" have failed to permanently change the state of the race. For Iran to have any real effect on the general election, it would likely have to stay in the news for the next several months.\n\nIn theory, the Republican Party might have an advantage in an election focused on national security, as the GOP has long been seen as better at protecting the country from external threats, according to Gallup polling. However, the gap has narrowed during the Trump era, and other polls suggest Trump himself is not very well trusted on foreign policy.\n\nIt's possible that Trump could become more popular in the wake of this month's attacks thanks to the \"rally-around-the-flag effect,\" or the idea that major international crises can unite the country around the commander-in-chief. However, this effect is not an ironclad rule, and context plays a major role in whether a rally-around-the-flag polling bump develops at all.\n\nUltimately, in keeping with our highly polarized times, the most plausible theory is probably that opinion on Iran will break down along partisan lines\u2014and therefore won't do much to change the trajectory of the general election. One of political science's most consistent findings on this issue is that elite cues drive public opinion on foreign policy. In other words, if the president's critics support a conflict and bend the metaphorical knee to the commander-in-chief, the public takes note and does the same. But if elite opinion splits along partisan lines\u2014as it is doing so far on Iran\u2014then so will public opinion.",
    " Title: Iraq War's Legacy Looms Over Obama's Syria Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing Syrian regime's potential use of chemical weapons presents a political dilemma for President Obama, often referred to as the \"slam dunk\" issue. This term was used by then-CIA director George Tenet in reference to Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) during the Bush administration.\n\nIn his 2007 book \"At the Center of the Storm,\" Tenet admitted that there was no serious debate within the administration about the imminence of the Iraqi threat, and that there were no in-depth discussions of possible alternatives to military invasion. The Iraq War, which has resulted in 4,486 U.S. military fatalities and at least several hundred U.S. civilian contractor deaths in Iraq, has left a lasting impact on the Syria debate.\n\nThe New Yorker's Amy Davidson writes that Iraq has \"informed every part of this debate.\" A Politico article carries the headline \"Iraq haunts President Obama's Syria choices.\" According to Politico, Obama's advisers are cautious about the Syria crisis, fearing a repeat of the Iraq War.\n\nObama has already had a \"slam dunk\" moment with his assertion that the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons against Syrian rebels would constitute crossing an unacceptable \"red line,\" implying a potential U.S. military response. However, the White House's statement this week suggests that the red line may not have been fully crossed, with the phrase \"small scale\" used to describe the chemical agent sarin's use.\n\nObama's initial use of \"red line\" regarding Syria left room for maneuver, as he warned last summer that \"a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.\" Critics may view this as waffling, but there is a clear difference between \"small scale\" and \"a whole bunch\" of chemical weapons being used.\n\nThe Obama administration now faces a lot of soul-searching, including a review of history regarding other controversial intelligence assessments, as some officials consider the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which gave President Lyndon Johnson the authority to conduct war in Vietnam without formal declaration.\n\nThe Obama administration's \"red line\" stands, along with the \"varying degrees of confidence\" among U.S. intelligence agencies regarding Syria's use of chemical weapons. Retired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni told Time magazine, \"The trouble with statements like that is you can get drawn into military operations.\" This is the situation the Obama administration now finds itself in.",
    " Title: Trump Signs Executive Order on Police Reform, Critics Say It Falls Short\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday aimed at improving police training and encouraging departments to meet higher certification standards on use of force. The order comes in response to the killing of George Floyd by police last month, which has led to widespread protests and calls for police reform.\n\nIn a Rose Garden ceremony, Trump largely defended police officers, stating that Americans \"demand law and order.\" The order will create a database to track police officers with multiple instances of misconduct, and use federal grants to encourage departments to meet certain standards. It will also call on departments to involve social workers and mental health professionals on calls dealing with homelessness, mental illness, and addiction.\n\nThe order also calls for police departments to ban the use of chokeholds except when an officer feels their life is endangered. However, it is unclear what practical effect this may have, given questions about Trump's powers over law enforcement, which is mostly state and local authority.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jim Jordan called the order a \"tremendous step forward in improving the system and beginning a new era in the relationship between communities and the police officers that keep them safe.\"\n\nCritics, however, faulted what they called an empty photo op, stating that the order is unlikely to result in practical changes to policing for much of the country. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the order \"falls sadly and seriously short of what is required to combat the epidemic of racial injustice and police brutality that is murdering hundreds of Black Americans.\"\n\nThe order does not address concerns about police treating African Americans and people of color unfairly. Instead, it focuses on breaking down barriers and bringing communities together, and not demonizing the police, according to Trump.\n\nTrump also defended law enforcement, stating that the number of bad officers is \"very tiny.\" He denounced what he termed \"radical and dangerous\" proposals to defund police departments, asserting that many departments are underfunded and under-supported.\n\nSome activists responding to recent killings by police have rallied behind the slogan \"defund the police,\" which they say would involve taking some money given to departments today and using it for mental health, social work, and other functions apart from patrol-style policing.\n\nTrump and Republicans have seized on what they call extreme ideas about abolishing police departments altogether. Before signing the order on Tuesday, Trump said he met with several families who lost loved ones \"in deadly interactions with police.\"\n\nThe precise details of the order were not immediately clear, but according to at least one report, the mother of a Pittsburgh boy who was killed by police said she had traveled to Washington for meetings this week but would not talk with Trump.\n\nTrump touted positive economic news and steps his administration has taken to assist minority communities, such as empowerment zones and aid to historically black colleges and universities. Trump also said \"We must build upon our heritage, not tear it down,\" an apparent reference to the dismantling of Confederate and other statues around the country.\n\nThe White House is also in a political confrontation with Congress over the apparent expansion of bipartisan support among lawmakers to rename U.S. military facilities named for Confederate commanders. Meanwhile, the Senate Judiciary Committee has convened a hearing Tuesday afternoon on policing and community relations, and Senate Republicans continue work on a policing bill they are expected to unveil this week. The Democratic-led House of Representatives has introduced a bill that would also ban chokeholds.",
    " Title: The Role of Money in Presidential Elections: A Historical Perspective and the 2020 Scenario\n\nArticle:\n\nThe historical trend of wealthy individuals attempting to secure presidential victories through substantial financial backing has not guaranteed success, as demonstrated by cases such as Meg Whitman, Carly Fiorina, Linda McMahon, and Ross Perot in the past. The latest addition to this list could be Howard Schultz in the current election cycle. David Koch, a Libertarian Party candidate for vice president in 1980, also falls under this category.\n\nIn essence, the significance of the \"money primary\" lies not in the importance of money itself, but in its role in determining which candidates receive media attention. A minimal amount of funds is necessary to maintain a campaign, travel, and manage essential functions. However, beyond this baseline, money is typically allocated towards consultants and television advertisements.\n\nCandidates continue to spend a significant portion of their funds on television ads, as this medium is popular among the baby boomer demographic, which is more likely to vote. However, TV ads are often ineffective in targeting specific demographics and come at a premium, with many swing-state local TV stations willing to incur losses for the guaranteed revenue from presidential election campaigns.\n\nIn 2020, earned (free) media will once again play a crucial role, with social media, particularly Facebook and Instagram, becoming increasingly significant. While some individuals are swayed by television, many more are influenced by their friends and peers.\n\nIn light of the current political climate, the electorate's polarization has diminished the effectiveness of television ads in persuading voters. As a result, the 2020 presidential election is expected to see a shift towards earned media on social platforms.\n\nFor a comprehensive overview of the 2020 presidential candidates' Q1 fundraising totals, readers are encouraged to delve deeper into the specifics of each candidate's financial support.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Authorizes Subpoena for Full Mueller Report and Associated Evidence\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday authorized Chairman Jerry Nadler to issue a subpoena for special counsel Robert Mueller's full report and all underlying evidence collected by Mueller. This move gives Nadler the discretion to issue a subpoena to Attorney General William Barr at any time, a decision that is likely to initiate a legal confrontation between Congress and the Justice Department.\n\nHowever, Nadler stated that he does not intend to issue the subpoena immediately. Instead, he plans to give Barr time to reconsider his decision to redact the report before submitting it to Congress. \"If that doesn\u2019t work out, in a very short order, we\u2019ll issue the subpoenas,\" Nadler said.\n\nIn addition to authorizing subpoenas for Mueller's report, the committee also authorized subpoenas for five former senior aides to President Donald Trump as part of a broad obstruction of justice and corruption probe. The individuals include former chief of staff Reince Priebus, former adviser Steve Bannon, former White House counsel Don McGahn, McGahn's former deputy Ann Donaldson, and former communications director Hope Hicks.\n\nThe authorization for subpoenas puts Congress on an aggressive footing while Barr reviews Mueller's report and redacts several categories of information. Barr has indicated he intends to redact classified information, grand jury testimony, material relevant to ongoing investigations, and \"reputational\" information that could be harmful to \"peripheral third parties.\"\n\nDemocrats have argued that Congress should have access to all of the information, even if it is blacked out of the version of the report Barr makes public. They note that Republicans received material in all four categories when they demanded documents from the Justice Department over the past two years.\n\nIn a recent letter to lawmakers, Barr said he intends to provide the redacted version of the report to Congress by \"mid-April.\" He also offered to testify before Congress in early May. House Democrats rejected that offer as insufficient and demanded he testify immediately.\n\nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee criticized the subpoena effort as a partisan push to attack the president. Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the ranking Republican on the panel, said Democrats are asking Barr to violate laws and regulations to reveal redacted information.\n\nCollins also suggested that some of the Trump aides who Democrats authorized subpoenas for have indicated a willingness to cooperate. He called the effort \"political theater\" intended to get reporters to write about subpoenas for close aides to the president.\n\nNadler repeatedly invoked the investigation of President Bill Clinton by former independent counsel Ken Starr as an example of why Mueller\u2019s report should be released. Though Nadler was a harsh critic of Starr at the time, he emphasized Wednesday that Starr provided Congress voluminous material that Barr now proposes to redact.\n\nSome Republicans urged Nadler to go to court and ask a judge to lift the restriction on sharing grand jury material. Nadler indicated he intends to do that but wants the committee to issue a subpoena first.\n\n\"These investigations should end. We should move on. We shouldn\u2019t be issuing subpoenas today,\" Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) said. But Ratcliffe said if the committee intends to issue subpoenas, \"Let\u2019s issue one for Bob Mueller. Let\u2019s ask Bob Mueller whether he thinks the report that he created should be disclosed without considerations of classified national security information or without redactions for grand jury information.\"\n\nRepublicans repeatedly indicated that Mueller\u2019s report found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and made no conclusion on obstruction of justice, prompting sharp rejoinders from Democrats who noted none of them had seen the report yet.\n\n\"Why are we here? It seems to me we\u2019re here because the Mueller report wasn\u2019t what the Democrat thought it would be,\" wondered Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).\n\n\"I\u2019ve seen the principal findings from the attorney general,\" Jordan said.",
    " Title: Romney Expresses Confidence Following Debate Series, Renews Attacks on Obama's Second-Term Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, expressed confidence Tuesday during a rally in Henderson, Nevada, stating that the debates with President Barack Obama had \"super-charged\" his campaign. Romney told a crowd of approximately 6,000 people that there was an increase in enthusiasm and support following the debates.\n\nRomney renewed his criticism of Obama's second-term agenda, stating that the president had been reduced to defending characters on Sesame Street and engaging in word games, while his attacks on Romney were not an agenda in themselves. Romney claimed that the debates had revealed a lack of an agenda from the president, contributing to his campaign's struggles while Romney's campaign was gaining momentum.\n\nThe third debate between the two candidates, focused on foreign policy, took place on Monday night. A CNN instant poll showed that debate watchers gave Obama the edge in that meeting, and Democrats quickly pointed to areas where Romney seemed to agree with the president's policies. A senior adviser to Romney acknowledged that there were areas of agreement, but emphasized Romney's stance on China and modernizing the Navy as notable differences.\n\nRomney's running mate, Paul Ryan, echoed the campaign's confident demeanor during a joint rally with Romney on Tuesday, stating that in two weeks, President Obama would become \"former President Barack Obama\" and Mitt Romney would be the next President of the United States. Both Romney and Ryan urged the Nevada audience to vote early, as polls show a tight race in Nevada with Obama holding a slight edge.\n\nPresident Obama is scheduled to rally an audience in Las Vegas the following night.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Advocates for Complete Dismantling of the Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday announced its support for a federal judge's ruling that the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, should be overturned. This shift in the Justice Department's position has alarmed Democrats who have vowed to oppose the move.\n\nIn a filing with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, three Justice Department lawyers stated, \"The Department of Justice has determined that the district court's judgment should be affirmed.\" They further clarified, \"The United States is not urging that any portion of the district court's judgment be reversed.\"\n\nThe consequences could be substantial if the courts ultimately strike down Obamacare, as more than 20 million Americans are covered through the ACA's Medicaid expansion and its insurance exchanges. The ACA, which has been the subject of repeated legal challenges since its 2010 passage, has transformed the nation's health system, creating new patient protections and reshaping payments for doctors and hospitals.\n\nSome of the Trump administration's proposed drug price reforms depend on provisions contained in the ACA. The GOP-led states that initially brought the lawsuit, Texas v. United States, had called for the entire law to be invalidated because Congress eliminated its individual insurance mandate penalty.\n\nHouse Democrats, who had separately planned to introduce legislation on Tuesday that would fortify Obamacare, denounced the Trump administration's new legal position as \"unconscionable.\" Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement, \"Millions of Americans will lose their health care immediately if this decision is upheld.\"\n\nJustice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said the department \"has determined that the district court's comprehensive opinion came to the correct conclusion and will support it on appeal.\"\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr pledged to reconsider the Justice Department's stance on the lawsuit during his Senate confirmation hearing. However, legal experts had not expected Barr to take a more aggressive position than his predecessor Jeff Sessions, who told career Justice Department lawyers to drop their defense of the law, leading three lawyers to remove their names from the government's brief and prompting the senior attorney, Joel McElvain, to resign.\n\nNick Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor who has criticized the ruling, stated, \"Barr inherited an indefensible legal position. But instead of backing down, he's embraced a downright crazy one.\" A group of Democratic-led states led by California is challenging the Texas ruling, arguing that the federal health care law can remain in place even without a tax penalty for Americans who forego health coverage.",
    " Title: Latino Groups Shift Strategy Away from Backlash, Focus on Voter Registration and Political Power\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of President Barack Obama's decision not to take executive action on immigration reform before the midterm elections, Latino leaders and advocacy groups have shifted their strategy from potential protests and political retribution to a focus on voter registration, political power, and ballot initiatives.\n\nLatino groups, unions, and civil rights organizations are concentrating on registering voters, raising funds to help elect more Hispanics to Congress, and highlighting ballot initiatives in states like Oregon that would restrict access to driver's licenses. They also plan to launch direct mail, radio, and TV ads as Election Day approaches.\n\nThe decision by leading Washington advocacy groups not to urge their large voting bloc to stay at home in November reflects the political calculation of senior Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the White House. Latino voters are unlikely to abandon the Democratic party, even with a delay on executive action, according to these leaders.\n\nCrist\u00f3bal Alex, the Latino Victory Project's executive director, predicted that more than 7 million Latino voters would turn out for the midterm elections. The White House has also played a role in quelling some anger by holding a series of meetings with stakeholders since the announcement that Obama would not move forward before the election.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear whether Hispanics will respond to the call to vote. Obama's decision to postpone an executive order until the end of the year has made the job of driving up interest among Latino voters, already a challenge in midterm election years, much more difficult, according to activists and political analysts.\n\nImmigration reform is not a widely used topic to turn out the voters in the midterms. Instead, the drive is focused on motivating Latino voters over issues like education, health care, the economy, and the environment.\n\nSo far, there are 100 partners in the Hispanic Heritage Month get-out-the-vote movement, which has registered more than 38,000 people online. The effort has more voter registration events planned next week in Texas, Florida, and Utah, and is also engaging through Twitter.\n\nIf Latino voters show up on Election Day, they could prove decisive in close Senate, House, and gubernatorial races, according to an analysis from the polling firm Latino Decisions. The Senate contest in Colorado, where 14 percent of eligible registered voters are Hispanic, is a clear example. Latino Decisions has also identified the Michigan, North Carolina, and Georgia Senate races as campaigns where Latino voting rates could swing the election. Even in Kansas, where Latinos make up 5.5 percent of registered voters, Hispanic turnout could swing the election if candidates target them, according to Matt Barreto, co-founder of polling firm Latino Decisions.\n\nThe top-tier gubernatorial races for Latino influence include Illinois, Florida, Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Texas, according to the firm. If these elections come down to the margins, the growing Hispanic electorate in each state could decide the outcome, Barreto said.\n\nIn response to a reporter's question about whether he was advocating that Latinos stay home in November, Gary Segura, a Latino Decisions co-founder, clarified that he was speaking as an analyst. However, his comments prompted a quick retort from Janet Murgu\u00eda, president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, who stated that the NCLR is not encouraging anyone to sit on the sidelines.\n\nA June poll conducted by Latino Decisions with the Center for American Progress found that 57 percent of Latinos said Obama's failure to take executive action would leave them less enthusiastic about voting Democratic and 54 percent said they would be less excited to vote at all. Latino outside groups are aware of the need to try to energize their base, so they expect to push ahead.\n\nNext week, several groups, including the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, will be in Arizona to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the first statewide anti-immigration proposition in California, which spurred Latino and immigrant participation in the election process. The drive to raise cash has also continued, with the Latino Victory PAC and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC hosting a fundraiser Wednesday evening at Rosa Mexicano.",
    " Title: U.S. Adds 222,000 Jobs in June, Exceeding Expectations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. jobs market experienced a significant growth in June, with the addition of 222,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department's report released on Friday. This figure surpassed the 152,000 jobs added in May and economists' expectations of 140,000 to 200,000 jobs. May's numbers were revised up from the initial gain of 138,000 jobs reported last month.\n\nEmployment increased by 37,000 jobs in the healthcare sector, 23,000 in the social assistance sector, 17,000 in the financial sector, and 8,000 in the mining sector. The average hourly earnings increased by 4 cents in June, to $26.25. On a year-over-year basis, wages increased by 2.5 percent.\n\nSince the start of the year, the unemployment rate has decreased by 0.4 percent, and the number of people who are unemployed has fallen by 658,000, according to the Labor Department. The number of long-term unemployed people stayed roughly flat, at 1.7 million people, in June. Since the start of the year, the number of long-term unemployed people has decreased by 322,000.\n\nThe labor force participation rate in June was 62.8 percent, about the same as last month. Economists were split on what the jobs report means for the chances of future interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.\n\nAmerican Action Forum President Douglas Holtz-Eakin wrote on his organization's website that the Labor Department's report will allow the Fed to increase rates. Curt Long, chief economist at the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions, suggested that another rate increase may not happen this year because wage growth has stalled, which could lead to concerns about low inflation.\n\nThe jobs numbers come after President Trump earlier this week expressed his discontent on Twitter that the media is not spending enough time covering the economic gains that have occurred since he took office in January. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) stated that the June report \"shows an economy where American workers still are not getting the bigger paychecks they deserve.\"\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said that the jobs report showed \"positive gains\" but that Congress still has \"a lot more work to do to make it easier for all Americans to earn higher wages, find good-paying jobs, and get ahead.\" Jason Furman, who served as chairman of former President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, called June's job gains \"impressive\" but the news on wages \"disappointing.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Implements Changes to Federal Employee Compensation and Dismissal Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has implemented changes to the compensation and dismissal policies for civilian federal workers, freezing their automatic 2.1% pay raise for 2019. The move, according to the President, is a necessary step to address perceived disparities between federal employee salaries and those in the private sector.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office reports that federal workers, on average, earn higher salaries than their private-sector counterparts performing similar jobs and receive benefit packages that are 47% more generous. Federal employees also receive up to 49 paid days off annually, compared to the private sector's average of 10 days.\n\nIn his 2018 State of the Union address, Trump promised to \"reward good workers\" and \"remove federal employees who undermine the public trust.\" In May, Trump issued executive orders aimed at streamlining the process for terminating problematic employees and shortening the performance improvement period from up to 120 days to 30 days. The changes also aim to expedite the appeals process, reducing the average duration from eight months to an unspecified shorter period.\n\nAccording to Office of Personnel Management data, only a minuscule half of one percent of federal workers are terminated each year, which is one-fifth the firing rate in the private sector. The changes have received support from more than half of federal workers, according to a June poll, with many expressing frustration over the perceived lack of accountability and the impact on their workloads.\n\nTrump's executive orders also limit federal employees from spending more than 25% of their working hours on union business, a move estimated to save taxpayers $100 million annually. The changes have faced legal challenges from public-sector unions, with a federal district court judge ruling in August that the changes must be decided through collective bargaining, not by the President. Trump's Justice Department is appealing the decision.\n\nIn addition to these changes, Trump is working to reform the Veterans Administration, where a scandal erupted in 2014 over employees doctoring patient waiting lists. The changes to the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, enacted in 2017 to address some of the red tape involved in firing and disciplining wrongdoers, are being held up by union-driven litigation.\n\nOne such case involves Jeffrey Sayers, the head of pharmacy for the Los Angeles area VA, who was terminated for mishandling prescription drugs. Sayers is suing for back pay and reinstatement, claiming he was fired too quickly.\n\nThe success of Trump's efforts to protect veterans and ensure taxpayer value in every government department hinges on restoring merit-based management in the federal bureaucracy, as the original intent of the Pendleton Act of 1883 was to replace the partisan spoils system with merit. However, the current system, referred to as the TIMER system, rewards employees based on their tenure rather than their work quality.",
    " Title: Federal Appeals Court Upholds Trump Administration's Denial of Grant Money to Sanctuary Jurisdictions\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled in favor of the Trump administration in its dispute with \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions, allowing the administration to withhold grant money from states that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York overturned a lower court ruling that had stopped the administration's 2017 move to withhold grant money from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program.\n\nThe decision conflicts with rulings from other appeals courts concerning sanctuary policies, indicating a likely Supreme Court review. The Trump administration's fight against sanctuary policies, which limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities, has been a contentious issue.\n\nThe appeals court ruled that the federal government can impose conditions on the federal grants at issue, as these conditions help the federal government enforce national immigration laws and policies supported by successive Democratic and Republican administrations. The court also noted that in immigration policy, the Supreme Court has found that the federal government maintains \"broad\" and \"preeminent\" power.\n\nThe ruling marks a key win for the administration in its efforts to crack down on the use of sanctuary policies. The Justice Department recently announced a series of measures, and President Trump has called on Congress to pass legislation that would allow victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants to sue sanctuary cities and states.\n\nThe administration has been relentless in its pushback against sanctuary policies, highlighting cases in which criminals are released onto the streets only to re-offend. It has also deployed a series of measures to combat the practice, including deploying elite Border Patrol agents to sanctuary cities to help ICE track down and detain illegal immigrants.\n\nThe ruling is potentially an important development, as states like New York rely heavily on Department of Justice grant money. Mike Howell, a former member of the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Legal Counsel, told Fox News that the ruling is significant because of the amount of money that flows in via grants and the federal government's power over states and localities. If the federal government is able to condition that grant money, it's a huge deal, he said.\n\nSanctuary policies generally forbid local law enforcement from honoring detainers, requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that they be alerted to the release of an illegal immigrant from custody so they can be picked up by ICE and put through deportation proceedings. Proponents of the policies claim it makes cities safer because it encourages illegal immigrants to cooperate with police without fear of deportation. However, the Trump administration has been pushing back by highlighting cases in which criminals are released onto the streets only to re-offend.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Immigration Order and the Role of the Ninth Circuit Court\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration's immigration order, which temporarily restricts entry to the United States by individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries, has been a subject of intense debate and legal challenges. The order, which is based on the President's authority over foreign policy and immigration under the U.S. Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, has been upheld by some and criticized by others.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution vests plenary power in the President regarding foreign policy and immigration. Section 212 (f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 allows the President to suspend the entry of aliens or any class of aliens into the United States if they are deemed detrimental to the interests of the United States. The Trump administration's order is not dissimilar to previous orders issued by past presidents, with examples including Barack Obama's six-month ban on Iraqi entry in 2011 and Jimmy Carter's ban on Iranians during the hostage crisis.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, has been criticized for its ruling that temporarily halted the implementation of the Trump administration's order. The court's decision was based on the grounds that the order and the president's rhetoric on immigration were not politically correct. This decision has sparked calls for reform, with some arguing that the court's ruling ignores federal law and is a result of leftist politics.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court, like other federal courts, is established by Article 3, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution. The court, and others like it, can be changed through federal statutes. In 2004, a bill was passed by the Republican-led House to break up the Ninth Circuit into three separate entities, but the plan was shot down by Democrats. The idea of reforming or abolishing the court has been suggested by political figures such as Newt Gingrich, who has criticized the court for making \"anti-American\" rulings.\n\nThe Supreme Court, currently in a 4-4 ideological split, is expected to review the Ninth Circuit's ruling. The outcome of this review remains to be seen, but many legal analysts believe the Supreme Court will overturn the Ninth Circuit's decision. The controversy surrounding the Ninth Circuit's ruling has reignited discussions about the need for court reform, with some arguing that the court's decision is a clear example of the need for change.\n\nThe Trump administration's immigration order has sparked intense debate and legal challenges, with the Ninth Circuit Court's ruling being a point of contention. The outcome of the Supreme Court's review of the Ninth Circuit's decision will likely have significant implications for the future of immigration policy in the United States.",
    " Title: Donald Trump Jr. Accuses BBC of Anti-Israel Bias in Tweets Over Jerusalem Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets, Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, has accused the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) of publishing misleading headlines regarding attacks against Israelis.\n\nOn July 14, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted, \"Three Palestinians killed after deadly stabbing in Jerusalem,\" which he later described as \"as close to being misleading as possible.\" In response, he stated, \"Two Israeli cops killed, third injured, in a Muslim terror attack.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Trump Jr.'s reaction and expressed gratitude for his unwavering support for Israel. The BBC, it seems, did not learn from this incident. A few days later, Trump Jr. again criticized the BBC for omitting key details about an attack in Jerusalem that left two policemen dead.\n\nOther social media users also noticed the BBC's reporting and provided their own accounts of the events. John Cardillo, a media personality, tweeted, \"Two Israeli cops killed, third injured, in a Muslim terror attack.\"\n\nThe BBC did provide more information on the victims, naming the two policemen who died of their injuries in the hospital as Advanced Staff Sergeant Major Kamil Shanan, aged 22, and Advanced Staff Sergeant Major Hail Sattawi, who was 30. Both victims were Druze from Israel's northern Galilee region.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump Jr. has called out the BBC's alleged anti-Israel bias. Previously, the BBC deleted a tweet that Trump Jr. criticized.\n\nIn addition to his criticism of the BBC, Trump Jr. is currently facing a media firestorm following reports that he met with a Russian lawyer last year after learning she may have opposition research on Hillary Clinton. Some lawmakers are calling for him to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
    " Title: North Korea Announces Resumption of Nuclear Reactor at Yongbyon Plant\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has announced its intention to restart a nuclear reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear plant, escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The move comes after a rare plenary meeting of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party, which set a new strategic direction for the nation.\n\nIn a statement, North Korea said work to restart all facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear plant will begin without delay. The country cited an acute electricity shortage and the need to bolster its nuclear armed forces as reasons for the move. Analysts suggest that Pyongyang views its nuclear arms program as essential for national security and non-negotiable.\n\nThe plutonium reactor, which was shut down in 2007 as part of international nuclear disarmament talks that have since stalled, is capable of producing approximately one bomb's worth of plutonium per year. The declaration of a resumption of plutonium production, along with the restart of other facilities at the main Yongbyon nuclear complex, will heighten concerns in Washington and among its allies about North Korea's timetable for building a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, a technology it is not currently believed to possess.\n\nThe announcement comes after the Pentagon sent two F-22 Raptor fighter jets to South Korea to participate in U.S.-South Korean military drills. This follows last week's news that nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bombers had conducted a training flight to the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe North, and its young leader Kim Jong Un, have been blaming the U.S.-South Korean military drills (which have been conducted many times in recent decades) for the current tensions. The North has cut hotlines to the South and annulled the 1953 armistice that ended open warfare on the peninsula.\n\nSouth Korea's new president, Park Geun-hye, described the security situation as \"grave.\" Yonhap News reports that she believes \"discouraging North Korea from provocations through strong diplomatic and military deterrence is just as important as punishing the communist nation after provocations.\"\n\nState Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland cast doubts on whether Pyongyang would go ahead with its vow. \"There's a long way to go between a stated intention and actually being able to pull it off,\" she said. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said the U.S. was paying close attention to the events on the Korean peninsula. \"The entire national security team is focused on it,\" he said.",
    " Title: FBI Director's Email Review Announcement Sparks Controversy Among Political Figures\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The announcement by FBI Director James Comey on Friday regarding the bureau's review of newly-discovered emails related to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server has sparked controversy among political figures, with Clinton campaign officials urging Comey to provide more details about the ongoing investigation.\n\nClinton campaign chairman John Podesta, appearing on CNN's State of the Union with Jake Tapper, described Comey's letter as \"long on innuendo, short on facts.\" Podesta noted that Comey could not even say if the emails contained significant information. He accused Comey of breaking with precedent by disclosing information about an ongoing investigation before determining if the newly-discovered emails provide any new insights.\n\n\"If they're not significant, they're not significant,\" said Podesta, who called Comey's action \"inappropriate.\" He added that Comey \"should have read them first\" before making a bombshell announcement about the emails just 11 days before the election.\n\n\"This is something that has been tossed into the middle of the campaign,\" Podesta said. \"We would have preferred that that not happen, but now that it has happened, we would prefer that Mr. Comey come forward and explain why he took that unprecedented step.\"\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch objected to Comey's decision to announce the probe, according to Justice Department sources, because she felt it violated department policy to not take steps that may interfere with an election.\n\nThe FBI obtained a warrant to review emails linked to Huma Abedin, a longtime Clinton aide and adviser. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said he does not believe Comey's action will cost Clinton the election.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Mook said on NBC's Meet the Press, adding that Clinton is gaining an \"insurmountable lead\" in the swing state of Nevada.\n\nHowever, Mook urged Comey to put more information about the emails \"out there on the table.\" If Comey does not do that, Mook said, the FBI director will end up fueling conspiracy theories.\n\n\"Let's just get all the information out there so that rumors and hypotheticals can be put to rest,\" Mook said.\n\nDonald Trump tweeted Sunday that Democratic criticism of Comey is hypocritical. Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, praised the FBI's decision to review the emails but sent an ambiguous message about how it might affect the election.\n\n\"I don't think it alters the campaign at all,\" Pence told Fox News Sunday. \"What we already know here is troubling to the American people, and it's convincing millions of Americans that Hillary Clinton is just a risky choice in this election.\"\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine called Comey's letter \"extremely puzzling\" and a \"distraction\" in an interview with ABC News' This Week.\n\n\"It is just extremely puzzling,\" Kaine said. \"Why would you release information that is so incomplete when you haven't even seen the material yourself? Eleven days before an election, why would you talk about an ongoing investigation?\"\n\nKaine added that, \"As far as we know now, Director Comey knows nothing about the content of these emails.\"\n\nPodesta said Abedin has been fully cooperating with the FBI. He also said she remains on the campaign staff.\n\nTrump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised Comey's decision to announce the review of the newly found emails.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton flouted the law and set up a private server so she could hide stuff from the public,\" Conway said.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said, \"I'm not praising James Comey.\"\n\n\"I think this investigation has been bungled from the start,\" the senator said on Fox News.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called it \"a terrible error in judgement by (Comey) to release this kind of ambiguous letter.\"\n\n\"If the director can't clean up this mess, and I hope he will try, I think he ought to acknowledge that he made a serious mistake, and underscore once again that there's nothing that alters that core conclusion he reached in July,\" Schiff said on ABC's This Week. He was referring to Comey's previous announcement that Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in using a private server but had committed no crime.",
    " Title: Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Garners Increased Interest Following Democratic Debate Performance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first Democratic primary debate, several candidates aimed to gain national recognition, with a crowded stage of ten making it challenging. However, a few candidates managed to stand out, including Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nDuring the debate, there was a significant increase in search traffic for Gabbard, as well as Sen. Cory Booker and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. While Booker's search traffic spike was anticipated, Gabbard's was more surprising.\n\nComparing the number of views on each candidate's Wikipedia page from the past week, Gabbard generated the second-highest number of views, trailing only Sen. Elizabeth Warren. When examining the past month of page views on Wikipedia, Gabbard's totals are mostly keeping pace with the frontrunners, and when compared to another candidate polling in single digits, like Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Gabbard is more than doubling her totals.\n\nGoogle Trends data suggests that the increased interest in Gabbard may not be entirely unexpected. The past month of search data shows that, aside from her home state of Hawaii, it is individuals from New Hampshire and Iowa\u2014the early primary states\u2014who are searching for information about her.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that Gabbard's increased interest does not necessarily indicate that she is a serious contender. Gabbard has clashed with fellow Democrats by being critical of President Obama's foreign policy, stating that his administration \"refuses to recognize\" that \"radical Islam\" is responsible for terrorism. She has also been criticized for expressing support for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn conclusion, the heightened interest in Gabbard following the Democratic debate may not have come out of nowhere, as she has generated significant search traffic and Wikipedia page views. However, her controversial foreign policy stances and past criticisms may limit her chances of becoming a serious contender in the Democratic primary.",
    " Title: Progressives Struggle to Articulate Economic Benefits of Immigration as Critics Highlight Alleged Harm\n\nArticle:\n\nA growing reluctance among progressives to articulate the economic benefits of immigration is notable, especially given the clear and concrete arguments made by critics who argue that immigrants increase crime, lower wages, threaten jobs, spread disease, strain government budgets, and abet terrorism. However, it is important to note that these claims are not universally supported, as immigrants have crime rates lower than native-born individuals.\n\nIn contrast, progressives often defend immigration with vague, abstract statements such as \"our diversity is our strength.\" Progressives tend to approach the issue through a civil rights lens, focusing on doing justice to the poor and oppressed, rather than meeting America's economic needs or slowing demographic decline.\n\nAndrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group, notes that progressives have yet to develop a coherent, cogent, and succinct political case for immigration. \"People on the left have a hard time arguing why immigration is important to the country,\" Selee said. \"This is still one of the most pro-immigrant societies in the world, but that diffuse feeling hasn't been matched with a coherent, cogent, succinct political case.\"\n\nThe current border crisis has garnered significant attention, often overshadowing the benefits of legal immigration. It is worth noting that three-quarters of immigrants are in the United States legally. With the foreign-born share of the population nearing record highs, and restrictionists seeking cuts in legal admissions, progressives cannot afford to remain merely anti-anti-immigrant. If they want to sustain the longest, most diverse epoch of mass migration in American history, they need to explain why.\n\nTo understand the progressives' mindset, it is important to understand their two-decade quest for legalization and its bitter residue. If the right sees the undocumented as invaders, the left sees them as victims of poverty and violence. Moreover, progressives view them as family and friends. The average undocumented person has been in the United States for 15 years, and many have American children. Progressives warn that deportation campaigns destabilize entire communities, harming immigrants and natives alike.",
    " Title: Group of Economists Advocates for Continued Direct Cash Payments to Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of 153 economists, many of whom are reportedly of a left-leaning political persuasion, have signed a letter urging U.S. policymakers to continue providing direct cash payments to Americans until the economy strengthens. The economists argue that these payments can improve financial security, boost consumer spending, and speed up the economic recovery.\n\nThe letter, organized by the Economic Security Project and The Justice Collaborative, suggests that the initial economic impact payments served as a lifeline for some during the pandemic, and that significant economic fallout and continued demand lag will persist even as businesses reopen and jobs return.\n\nThe signatories of the letter include Jason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama Administration, Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist, Darrick Hamilton from the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at The Ohio State University, and Indivar Dutta-Gupty, co-executive director at the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality. Some of the signatories are reportedly advising the campaign of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, according to Reuters.\n\nThe $600 supplement added to weekly unemployment benefits, which has reportedly discouraged millions of Americans from seeking employment, is set to expire at the end of the month. With jobs still scarce, jobless Americans may face a \"cash cliff\" without continued government support.\n\nCongressional lawmakers are currently on a two-week recess and will face pressure to make decisions when they reconvene in late July. With money being printed and used to plug the record US budget deficit, the article suggests that Congress may promptly approve trillions more in handouts to avoid potential social unrest.",
    " Title: New York and California Face Potential Loss of Congressional Seats Due to Population Decline\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Census Bureau has released population estimates indicating that New York and California, two liberal states, are among 27 states and the District of Columbia that have experienced a decline in residents due to domestic migration over the last two years. The Empire State and the Golden State are poised to lose congressional seats due to this ongoing exodus.\n\nNew York, one of only 10 states to suffer a total population decline in 2018-19, experienced its fourth consecutive annual decrease after five years of growth, and the largest population drop of any state, according to the census data. The state's population has been stagnant over the past decade, with a modest 75,459 increase in residents since 2010, a growth rate of just 0.4 percent, ranking 46th-lowest out of 50 states. This stagnation is likely to result in the loss of one or two congressional seats in the coming years.\n\nStaten Island Republican Councilman Joe Borelli attributed the population decline to the high cost of living in New York, including high taxes, regulations, and housing costs. \"The cost of living in New York \u2014 the high taxes, regulations, and housing costs \u2014 are making it untenable to live the American dream here,\" Borelli told The New York Post, noting how many high school friends have moved out of New York.\n\nCalifornia's population growth has also continued to slow, and for the first time in the state's history, it may also lose a congressional seat. The Los Angeles Times reported that the state's economic woes are making it harder for people to make a living, so they're leaving. William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told the newspaper that California's population migration could result in the loss of a seat in the US House of Representatives. California currently has 53 seats in the House.\n\nAccording to Frey's analysis of census data, Texas may gain three seats after the 2020 decennial count, while states such as Arizona, Colorado, and Oregon may gain one seat apiece. The apportionment population count for each of the 50 states includes the state's total resident population\u2014citizens and non-citizens\u2014as well as a count of the overseas federal employees and their dependents who have that state listed as their home state in their employers' administrative records, according to the US Census Bureau.",
    " Title: Trump to Announce Executive Action on 2020 Census Citizenship Question Despite Ongoing Legal Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is set to announce an executive action regarding the inclusion of a citizenship question in the 2020 census, despite ongoing court challenges. The announcement is expected to be made during a news conference following a planned meeting on social media this afternoon. The exact timing is estimated to be around 5:00 p.m., either in the Rose Garden or another location at the White House.\n\nThe administration's efforts to add the contentious question have been blocked in the courts due to challenges from some U.S. states and civil rights groups. Critics argue that asking about citizenship in the census discriminates against racial minorities and is aimed at giving Republicans an unfair advantage in elections. Trump and his supporters argue that it is important to know how many non-citizens are living in the country.\n\nThe administration is still finalizing the details of the action, which is expected to be an executive order, according to one of the officials. The administration's attempts to add a question to the nation's decennial population survey have become embroiled in a legal fight not only due to the opposition of plaintiffs but also due to the Department of Justice's handling of the cases.\n\nThe case has already reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which last month ruled against Trump's first attempt to add the question, stating the administration's rationale was \"contrived.\" However, the court left the door open for a possible addition if officials could offer a new explanation. Since then, the Justice Department has sought to replace the lawyers handling the case. On Wednesday, a second federal judge rejected the department's efforts, stating it had to offer detailed reasoning for the change.\n\nAttorneys within the Trump administration have been studying the census issue and intend to keep the president's order within the confines of the Supreme Court decision. However, they are aware that whatever action Trump takes is likely to be challenged in court again. The U.S. Constitution specifically assigns the job of overseeing the census to Congress, which could complicate any effort to add the question via presidential missive.\n\nTrump remains insistent that the question be added to the census despite the legal challenges. The census is used to determine how many seats each state gets in the U.S. House of Representatives and also affects how billions of dollars in federal funds are distributed across the country.",
    " Title: Congressional Republicans Advocate for Medicare and Medicaid Cuts in Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Republicans are advocating for significant reductions in Medicare and Medicaid spending as part of the negotiations to address the fiscal cliff and deficit reduction. This stance is primarily directed against two programs that have been instrumental in public welfare for the past half-century.\n\nPostelection polls indicate that large majorities of voters for both President Obama and Mitt Romney opposed large Medicare cuts as a means to reduce the budget deficit. The Obama administration has already pledged to extract over $1 trillion in savings from these programs over the next decade. With limited room for further cuts without affecting the most vulnerable Americans, the focus may shift towards finding alternative methods to address the fiscal cliff.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act includes provisions that will reduce projected Medicare spending by $716 billion over 10 years. These savings are primarily achieved through reducing annual increases in Medicare reimbursements for hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare providers, as well as by reducing unjustified subsidies paid to private Medicare Advantage plans. During the campaign, the Romney-Ryan ticket criticized the president for making such large cuts and even promised to restore all of it.\n\nIn addition to these savings, President Obama, in his budget for fiscal year 2013, proposed an additional $340 billion in Medicare spending reductions over 10 years. This includes tactics such as requiring drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare in certain circumstances, reducing payments to some healthcare providers for treating patients just released from the hospital, reducing coverage of bad debts that hospitals and skilled nursing homes have failed to collect from patients, and charging higher premiums to high-income beneficiaries.\n\nThese cuts may be acceptable as part of a larger budget deal to avert the fiscal cliff. However, there may be limited options for further reducing Medicare or Medicaid spending beyond these measures, as the fiscal health of healthcare providers should not be jeopardized.",
    " Title: Senate Impeachment Trial Resumes Monday: Final Arguments, Vote on Trump's Conviction or Acquittal Expected\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump resumes on Monday at 11 a.m. EST. The trial will continue with closing arguments from both the House impeachment managers and Trump's legal team. The Senate is expected to vote on whether to convict or acquit the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress on Wednesday.\n\nThe two articles of impeachment were approved by the Democratic-controlled House on Dec. 18 following a two-month inquiry into allegations that Trump held up military aid to pressure Ukraine into announcing investigations for his political benefit, including one involving former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic rival in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has maintained his innocence and claimed he was acting to combat corruption. His defense team has argued that the House failed to prove its case, that the abuse of power charge is too subjective, and that the obstruction of Congress charge infringes on the president's right to claim executive privilege in court. Attorney Alan Dershowitz made the argument, which many legal scholars dispute, that even if the allegations were true, they were not impeachable because they did not constitute a crime.\n\nLast week, the Senate voted 51-49 against issuing subpoenas for additional witnesses and documents, which would have delayed the trial's conclusion. Each side will have two hours to argue the case one final time before senators take to the floor to deliver speeches explaining how they view the charges. With a 53-47 seat Republican majority in the Senate and a two-thirds vote needed for conviction, it is almost certain the president will be acquitted in the final vote on Wednesday.\n\nSenators will vote Wednesday to acquit or convict Trump.\n\nDuring the impeachment trial and the upcoming Iowa caucuses on Monday, Democratic candidates Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, and Michael Bennet will have to juggle their campaign activities.\n\nLead House impeachment manager, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that Democrats \"proved the corrupt scheme that they charged in the articles of impeachment.\" Schiff stated that the only question now is whether the president should be removed from office because he has been found guilty of these offenses.\n\nSchiff also said that even if the Senate votes to acquit, \"the president was impeached\" because \"by standing up to this president as we have, by making the case to the American people, by exposing his wrongdoing, we are helping to slow the momentum away from our democratic values.\"\n\nSchiff declined to comment on whether the House would continue to seek testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton, who reportedly states in his upcoming book that Trump told him the aid to Ukraine was tied to the investigations Trump desired. However, Schiff said, \"the truth will come out.\"\n\nThe news of John Bolton's book has cast a shadow over the impeachment trial. GOP Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee stated that while Trump's actions were not impeachable, he should have gone through the Department of Justice if he had concerns about Biden and his son's former position on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.\n\n\"I think, generally speaking, going after corruption would be the right thing to do,\" Ernst, who declared she will vote to acquit, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"But I think he could have done it through different channels,\" she added, referring to Trump's decision to have his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, handle it.\n\nOn NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" Alexander said he believed Trump \"called the president of Ukraine and asked him to become involved in investigating Joe Biden.\" He also said, \"at least in part, he delayed the military and other assistance to Ukraine in order to encourage that investigation.\"\n\n\"I think he should not have done it. I think it was wrong,\" said Alexander, who plans to vote for acquittal. \"If he was upset about Joe Biden and his son and what they were doing in Ukraine, he should have called the attorney general and told him that, and let the attorney general handle it the way they always handle cases that involve public figures,\" said Alexander, who is not seeking re-election in November's election.\n\nWhen asked why he thought Trump did not go to the DOJ, Alexander said, \"Maybe he did not know to do it.\"\n\n\"I would think he would think twice before he did it again,\" he added.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News on Sunday that \"the day of reckoning is coming for congressional and Senate oversight of Joe Biden.\" Graham stated that he would bring in State Department officials and ask them why they did not do something about the obvious conflict of interests Joe Biden had.\n\n\"We're going to get to the bottom of this,\" he said. \"And I can prove beyond any doubt that Joe Biden's effort in the Ukraine to root out corruption was undercut, because he let his son sit on the board of the most corrupt company in the Ukraine, and we're not going to give him a pass on that.\"\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News, Ernst said Democrats had lowered the bar for impeachment to the point that if Biden were to become president, there would be voices calling for his removal because of Hunter Biden's connection to Burisma.\n\n\"I think this door of impeachable whatever has been opened,\" Ernst told Bloomberg. \"We can have a situation where if it should ever be President Biden, that immediately, people, right the day after he would be elected, would be saying, 'Well, we're going to impeach him.'\"\n\nDuring the impeachment trial, senators asked several questions, some of which are still unclear. The outcome of the trial will determine whether Trump is acquitted or convicted, and the implications for the 2020 election and future impeachments.",
    " Title: Three Reasons for Democratic Opposition to Border Wall Called False: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent column, conservative commentator Dennis Prager argues that three reasons commonly cited by Democrats for their opposition to building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border are false. Prager asserts that these reasons are not only unfounded but also constitute lies.\n\nPrager questions whether Democrats genuinely believe these arguments, suggesting that their beliefs are either delusional or intentionally deceptive. He points out that left-wing academics, including his former professors at Columbia University, have historically held controversial views on issues such as the Cold War, gender, and race.\n\nPrager also questions the Democrats' stance on the cost of the wall, stating that the $5.7 billion price tag is a small fraction of U.S. federal spending and that Democrats have consistently advocated for increased government spending. He also cites examples of large-scale projects, such as California's high-speed train, that have been pursued despite significant financial burdens.\n\nRegarding the effectiveness of the wall, Prager points out that many Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, have previously supported border fencing. He questions whether Democrats view fencing as effective but a wall as ineffective.\n\nLastly, Prager questions the moral argument against the wall, stating that Democrats have not provided a clear rationale for this position. He also questions whether Democrats view physical barriers as immoral in other contexts, such as around homes or communities.\n\nPrager concludes by suggesting that the left's use of lies to achieve their goals is a long-standing practice, and that truth has never been a core value for leftists. He emphasizes that while truth is a value for both liberals and conservatives, it has never been a value for the left, who prioritize other objectives over truth.\n\nDennis Prager is a nationally syndicated radio talk-show host and columnist.

    " Title: The Importance of Feeling Connected to Something Larger: A Key Factor in Living a Fulfilling Life, According to Behavioral Science\n\nArticle:\n\nA key factor in living a fulfilling life, according to behavioral science, is feeling connected to something larger than oneself. This concept, which exists at the heart of both ancient religions and modern social-justice movements, is not a new one, but it is often overlooked or difficult to achieve in practice.\n\nIn his book \"The Happiness Hypothesis,\" NYU social psychologist Jonathan Haidt identifies this sense of connection as one of three major themes of a fulfilling life. He compares humans to plants, stating that, like plants, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger to thrive.\n\nOn his website, Haidt expands on this point, stating that humans are like bees, needing to be part of a larger hive or a larger body to make sense of their lives. In modern society, people have become independent, free to live as they please, which may contribute to feelings of aimlessness or a lack of meaning in life for some individuals.\n\nHaidt suggests that joining a cause or organization with a noble purpose can help individuals find this sense of connection. He recommends joining an organization with a long and noble past, as it can provide a sense of \"vital engagement.\" This term refers to the crucial relationship that exists between a person and their surroundings.\n\nHaidt writes, \"It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of meaning seems like a fitting theme for 2017, as individuals seek to find a sense of connection and purpose in their lives. Joining a cause or organization with a noble purpose can provide a means to achieve this sense of connection and contribute to a fulfilling life.",
    " Title: Political Observers Predict Mitt Romney Victory in 2012 Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nPolitical observers, including veteran Republican campaign pollster John McLaughlin, are predicting a victory for Mitt Romney in the 2012 Presidential Election. McLaughlin, who is known for his accurate predictions, such as the 2010 wave that powered the GOP to capture more than five dozen seats in the House, believes that Romney has surged in all the target states and will win the election by a margin of 5 percentage points.\n\nHis prediction contradicts most polling, which shows a tight national race between Romney and President Obama, and state polls that show Obama leading in most battlegrounds. The only poll that shows Romney clearly winning is the respected Gallup national tracking poll of likely voters, which gives the Republican nominee a 5 percentage-point advantage.\n\nMark Meckler, co-founder and former national coordinator of the National Tea Party Patriots, also predicts a Romney win by 6 percentage points. He believes that the wave of anti-debt, anti-big-government voters that swept the Democrats in the 2010 congressional elections is readying itself again and will deliver a Romney victory.\n\nTea party coordinator Toby Marie Walker in Waco, Texas, sees the same momentum, predicting that Romney will receive 54 percent of the national vote. She believes that the shift in voter sentiment, which she has observed through phone calls to independents in other states, will give Romney more Senate seats than pollsters suggest.\n\nHowever, not all political observers share this view. Republican pollster Whit Ayres sees little evidence of a congressional wave this time, as his polling shows an even split between Democrats and Republicans on the generic ballot. Nevertheless, Ayres believes that independents who had voted for Obama by an 8-point margin in 2008 are now voting against Obama by double digits.\n\nNate Silver, who writes the FiveThirtyEight blog at The New York Times, believes that the election is moving in Obama's direction. He currently gives Obama a 77 percent chance of winning and predicts that he will receive nearly 300 electoral votes, up 10 from a week ago.\n\nDespite these predictions, some voters, such as Alaska tea partyer David Eastman, are not convinced. Eastman believes that small-government voters do not have much enthusiasm for Romney's campaign.\n\nJohn McLaughlin attributes the backlash against Obama from Hurricane Sandy as a significant factor in the election's outcome. He believes that voters without power who are cutting down trees in the Northeast and are very upset post-hurricane will not be kind to the incumbent president or his party if they lack power through Election Day.",
    " Title: Congressional Hearings on Benghazi and the Middle East: Expanding the Scope of Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton is testifying before Congress regarding the events in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. The hearing is expected to focus on the security lapses, the lack of rescue attempts, and the overall response to the attack that resulted in the deaths of four Americans.\n\nHowever, this article suggests that instead of focusing solely on the Benghazi incident, Congress should broaden the scope of the hearings to discuss the administration's policy towards the Arab world. The author argues that the region has descended into political and economic chaos in the two years since North Africa and the Middle East were relatively calm and stable.\n\nThe article poses ten questions for Secretary Clinton, focusing on various aspects of the administration's policy in the region. These questions include inquiries about the administration's relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the handling of Libya's weapons caches, the potential threat of chemical weapons in Syria, accountability for the Benghazi attack, the effectiveness of the 'light footprint' strategy, the safety of American civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan, the administration's relationship with Israel, potential responses to Iran's nuclear program, contingency plans for rescuing Americans in the region, and the expansion of drone wars.\n\nThe author contends that Secretary Clinton has much to explain, and that the hearings provide an opportunity to hold the administration accountable for its policies in the Arab world. The article concludes by suggesting that if Congress and the American people do not receive answers during these hearings, they may one day ask, \"who lost the Arab world?\" The author emphasizes the importance of getting Secretary Clinton on the record now.",
    " Title: Fox News Misrepresents Republican Support for the Sequester in Budget Control Act of 2011\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo reports on Fox News' Special Report with Bret Baier have been criticized for misrepresenting the Republican Party's support for the across-the-board automatic spending cuts known as the sequester. The reports reinforce a right-wing narrative that President Obama is solely responsible for these cuts, while in reality, a majority of Republicans in both the House and Senate voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011, which included the sequester.\n\nIn August 2011, shortly after the Senate passed the Budget Control Act, House Speaker John Boehner celebrated the law as \"a positive step forward that begins to rein in federal spending.\" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor touted the law as \"a significant move\" and said it \"will finally begin to change the way Washington spends taxpayer dollars.\" House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan declared the law a \"victory for those committed to controlling government spending and growing our economy.\" In total, 174 Republican representatives and 28 Republican senators\u2014a majority of Republicans in both chambers\u2014voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nHowever, in recent weeks, Fox News and other right-wing media outlets have been aggressively pushing myths about the sequester, including the false narrative that President Obama is single-handedly responsible for the looming spending cuts. On Wednesday's edition of Special Report, Fox News' chief White House correspondent Ed Henry framed a report on the sequester around the narrative that it was an Obama initiative and quoted Republican Congressman Randy Forbes blaming Obama for it. Though the report included Democratic Sen. Max Baucus saying that Congress shares the blame for the automatic cuts, Henry did not point out that Republicans not only actively supported the idea but overwhelmingly voted for the law.\n\nIn a later segment during the same show, Fox again covered up Republican support for the sequester. Discussing the consequences of the spending cuts, chief political correspondent Carl Cameron said, \"President Obama, who first proposed the sequester, and his party, are trying to blame the GOP for dire economic consequences, in particular to the military. But in 2009 he proposed spending $14 billion less than what the military is currently budgeted for should sequester happen.\" Cameron did not mention the Republican support for the Budget Control Act of 2011.",
    " Title: Lessons from the Wisconsin Recall Election: Insights from the Democratic Side\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Republican Governor Scott Walker's re-election in Wisconsin, Democratic activists and politicos have been reflecting on the reasons behind their party's loss. NPR's senior Washington editor, Ron Elving, provided insights on some aspects of the election, while this article focuses on the perspectives of Democratic activists in Waukesha, Wisconsin.\n\nThe mood among these activists, who were interviewed after the election, was a mix of exhaustion, disappointment, and combative reflection. They expressed concerns about the absence of President Obama during the recall effort, but acknowledged that his paid Wisconsin staff was involved in the recall campaign.\n\nOne key takeaway from the discussions was the realization that assumptions about union households should be avoided. Democrats at the table were surprised by the exit poll statistic showing that 38 percent of voters with a labor union member in the family voted for Walker. Kristin Hansen, a volunteer with Organizing for America, Obama's re-election organization, stated, \"You can't assume just because a person is a union member, they are also a Democrat.\"\n\nAnother issue raised was the impact of stricter voting registration laws enacted by the GOP-controlled Legislature since 2010. These changes have limited opportunities for registering voters, expanded blackout days for voter registration efforts, and set earlier deadlines for absentee or early voting. The new rules meant that Democrats had only eight days after the primary to register new voters.\n\nThe activists also noted the real sentiment among voters against recalls, with fewer than a third of voters thinking recalls were appropriate for any reason. This sentiment was not effectively addressed or combated by the Democrats, according to the activists.\n\nFurthermore, the impact of the Latino community and first-time voters was highlighted. The local Obama campaign lacked bilingual field organizers and visible volunteers from the Latino community, which was a missed opportunity, according to the activists.\n\nIn conclusion, the Democratic activists emphasized the importance of avoiding assumptions about union households, addressing stricter voting registration laws, combating anti-recall sentiment, and engaging with the Latino community and first-time voters in future elections.",
    " Title: West African Healthcare Workers Undergo Intense Training to Combat Ebola Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing battle against the Ebola virus in West Africa, the lack of isolation wards for infected individuals is a significant challenge. In response, President Obama has announced plans to construct 17 new Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in Liberia, which will require thousands of trained and willing healthcare workers.\n\nIn Monrovia, efforts are underway to train local doctors, nurses, and janitors on how to safely care for Ebola patients. The World Health Organization (WHO) has taken over a two-story concrete hotel and transformed the ground floor into a mock ETU.\n\nDuring a recent training session, trainees dressed in protective gear were simulating the care of an Ebola patient. The exercise, part of a one-week course, involved several trainees getting \"splattered\" with fake blood, a reminder of the real-life challenges they will face.\n\nDr. Srinivas Murthy, an infectious disease specialist from the University of British Columbia, is one of the WHO staff guiding the trainees. He emphasized the importance of maintaining calm and following protocol to minimize the risk of infection.\n\nThe trainees are the second group to go through the course. Of the 72 people in the class, 40 are healthcare workers of various types, including doctors, nurses, physicians' assistants, and medical students. The remaining 32 are hygienists who will be responsible for cleaning and disinfecting the ETUs.\n\nDuring the training, the trainees encountered numerous challenges, such as fogged goggles, torn gloves, and overheating in their protective suits. Despite these difficulties, they were expected to maintain focus and follow protocol.\n\nAs more Ebola treatment units are built, Liberia needs to find thousands of other workers who are willing to take on the risks associated with treating Ebola patients. The WHO aims to train several thousand new workers in the coming months.",
    " Title: Dalits in India Call for Acknowledgement of Centuries of Oppression, Citing Parallels with U.S. Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the anti-racism protests in the United States, members of the Dalit community in India, historically referred to as \"untouchables,\" have called for recognition of the centuries of oppression they have endured. Dalits, who are situated outside the Hindu caste hierarchy, have historically faced violence, segregation, and exclusion from various aspects of society, including being barred from having their shadows touch those of people from more privileged castes.\n\nOmprakash Mahato, president of the Birsa Ambedkar Phule Students Association, a Dalit organization at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, expressed solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, stating, \"We extend our solidarity because we feel them and we have faced discrimination ourselves.\"\n\nIndia outlawed discrimination based on caste in 1955, but ancient biases against Dalits and members of less privileged caste groups persist, making it difficult for them to access education, jobs, and housing. Mahato stated, \"In India, people need to admit their role in everyday discrimination faced by Dalits and only then can a dialogue for change be initiated. We hope what they are seeing unfolding globally will lead to soul searching.\"\n\nDalits and scheduled tribes, Indigenous peoples who are often isolated or disadvantaged, make up about a quarter of India's population of 1.3 billion. Ruth Manorama, who works for the rights of Dalit women, stated, \"Indian Dalits have historically learned a lot from the struggle of the African Americans.\" She also highlighted the discrimination faced by Dalits during India's strict lockdown, with Dalits often waiting longer for food or financial aid at local distribution points and being turned away.\n\nA Change.org petition, signed by approximately 300 people, emphasizes that \"the lives of Dalits and minorities matter too\" and urges Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to acknowledge that \"caste discrimination is included in racial discrimination.\" Henri Tiphagne of People's Watch, a charity supporting the petition, stated, \"It is a good time for people in India to understand and to point out to the government that racial discrimination is not only what you see in America, but it is the same as how so-called 'untouchables' are treated in India.\"",
    " Title: Trump and McMaster Disagree on Russian Interference in 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster have publicly disagreed over the issue of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that McMaster \"forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians.\"\n\nMcMaster, in a speech at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, stated that it is now \"incontrovertible\" that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. He emphasized that the evidence is now \"really incontrovertible and available in the public domain,\" contrasting previous difficulties in attributing such interference.\n\nMcMaster's remarks came after a federal grand jury indicted more than a dozen Russians in connection with the interference. In his speech, McMaster strongly condemned the Russian disinformation campaign, which, according to the indictment, aimed to sway American voters in favor of Trump.\n\nIn a separate tweet on Sunday, Trump seemed to deny ever denying Russia's involvement, stating, \"I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said 'it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400-pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.' The Russian 'hoax' was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!\"\n\nOn Saturday, McMaster did not equivocate in his remarks, using forceful language to convey American strength against Russian disinformation campaigns. He emphasized the need for the West to unite in defending against such threats.\n\nIn response to a question from a Russian politician about potential U.S.-Russia cooperation on cybersecurity, McMaster seemed to dismiss the notion, stating, \"I'm surprised there are any Russian cyber experts available, based on how active most of them have been in undermining our democracies in the West.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who spoke minutes earlier from the same stage, dismissed the indictment, calling it \"just blabber.\" The New York Times reports that Lavrov attempted to bolster his case that Russia has done nothing wrong by citing Vice President Mike Pence's earlier assessment of the FBI investigation.\n\nPence told Axios on Wednesday that \"irrespective of efforts that were made in 2016 by foreign powers, it is the universal conclusion of our intelligence communities that none of those efforts had any effect on the outcome of the 2016 election.\" However, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told NPR that \"the intelligence community has neither the authority nor the capability to make such a judgment as to whether there was or was not impact on the election.\"\n\nOn Friday, President Trump conceded in a tweet that Russia did carry out an \"anti-US campaign,\" but he stated that it began well before he launched his presidential run. \"The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!\" he wrote.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the investigation, stated on Friday that there is \"no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity\" and \"no allegation that this activity actually altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Trump implied in a tweet that the investigation itself plays into Russia's plans. \"If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S., then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams,\" he wrote. \"They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!\"",
    " Title: Parkland Student Activists Announce Nationwide Bus Tour for Gun Control Advocacy and Voter Registration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe student gun control activists from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who gained prominence following the mass shooting at their school in Parkland, Florida, in March, will embark on an extensive bus tour on Monday. The tour, titled \"March for Our Lives: Road to Change,\" will make 70 stops in 20 states, with the aim of advocating for stricter gun control legislation and voter registration.\n\nThe tour will be led by David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez, who have emerged as de facto spokespeople for the youth gun control movement. In an interview with Axios, Hogg, who graduated on Sunday along with Gonzalez and their fellow Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School seniors, stated, \"I'm glad I'm getting my diploma and not my death certificate.\"\n\nGonzalez, who plans to attend the New College of Florida in the fall, believes the tour will help increase support for the youth gun control movement among lawmakers who are concerned about the political implications of publicly opposing a coalition of young people. Gonzalez stated, \"If you don't support this, it'll look like you're going against kids.\"\n\nThe nationwide tour will be accompanied by a separate Florida-specific tour featuring stops in all of the state's congressional districts. As the Parkland students' home state, Florida has been a focal point of their voter registration and gun control awareness campaigns in recent months. However, the results thus far have not been encouraging: in six of Florida's seven largest counties, including Broward county where the shooting occurred, youth voter registration is down relative to 2014.\n\nThe student activists experienced a surge of enthusiasm in the wake of the shooting, but public support for gun control as the nation's top political priority has decreased significantly since then. Just 6% of respondents listed gun control as the most important problem facing the U.S. in an April Gallup poll, down from 13% in March.",
    " Title: House Republicans to Move Toward Contempt Charges Against Attorney General Eric Holder\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans have announced their intention to move forward with contempt charges against Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., escalating a power struggle over the Fast and Furious operation, a botched gun-walking program initiated during the Obama administration. The move, supported by Republican leaders, will see House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell E. Issa hold a vote next week to recommend contempt proceedings, with a House floor vote potentially following shortly thereafter.\n\nAdministration officials have dismissed the move as political, while the Justice Department stated it was close to reaching an agreement to share some of the information the Oversight Committee is seeking. House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, stated that Mr. Holder has had multiple opportunities to comply, and that the Justice Department is \"out of excuses.\"\n\nTrust between both parties has eroded, with Democrats arguing that the GOP is pursuing a political agenda to discredit President Obama, and Republicans citing repeated denials and inaccurate information provided by the administration. Mr. Holder and Mr. Obama have acknowledged flaws in Fast and Furious, a program that allowed guns to be sold to straw purchasers in the U.S., knowing they were being sent to Mexican cartels.\n\nThe operation was primarily handled by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives employees, with minimal oversight from the Justice Department, according to the administration. The department initially denied many details of the operation, including the fact that guns were knowingly \"walked\" without being tracked, but recanted in December, taking the embarrassing step of officially withdrawing an inaccurate letter sent to Congress.\n\nMr. Issa is seeking to obtain documents that he believes would show how the Justice Department changed its stance on the operation's details and the level of blame that should be assigned. His committee issued a subpoena for documents in October, and Mr. Issa stated on Monday that the Justice Department is still withholding the information.\n\nThe Justice Department has not provided any valid reasons for withholding the information, according to Mr. Issa. Mr. Holder's spokeswoman described the contempt proceedings as \"political games\" that interrupted what she claimed had been productive talks on turning over information.\n\nDeputy Attorney General James M. Cole stated that he has offered to meet with Mr. Issa to negotiate a compromise on documents, but that Mr. Issa has not responded to this request. In a letter on Monday afternoon, Mr. Cole said, \"The conversations between our staffs have been productive, and we believe that an amicable resolution of these matters is achievable. Because of this, the committee's decision to set a hearing on its draft contempt resolution is premature.\"\n\nDuring the operation, nearly 2,000 guns were sold to straw purchasers with the expectation that they would be trafficked across the border to the Sinaloa Cartel. ATF agents lost track of the guns, and the guns began to appear at crime scenes, including at least two weapons found at the scene of a shootout that killed U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010.\n\nMr. Holder stated that he took steps in 2011 to shut down the program and requested an internal audit to hold employees accountable. Last week, Mr. Holder told another House panel that he would be willing to meet with Mr. Boehner to try to work out a solution that would allow the documents to be reviewed without impinging on the executive branch's deliberative process.\n\nThis is not the first time the Obama administration has faced contempt of Congress proceedings. In 2008, the House approved a contempt resolution against former White House lawyer Harriet Miers, seeking an interview with her on her role in the firings of U.S. attorneys. She refused an on-the-record sworn interview with congressional investigators. The House voted 223-32 to hold her in contempt, with most Republicans boycotting the vote.\n\nAt the same time, former White House political adviser Karl Rove was refusing to be interviewed by the House Judiciary Committee. That matter never reached the House floor. In 2009, after President George W. Bush left office, Democrats and former Bush officials reached an agreement to produce documents and on-the-record testimony.",
    " Title: Philanthropist Patty Quillin Donates $1.5 Million to Support Criminal Justice Reform in Los Angeles County\n\nArticle:\n\nBillionaire philanthropist Patty Quillin, wife of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, has donated at least $1.5 million to support efforts to reform the criminal justice system in Los Angeles County. Quillin, who resides in Santa Cruz, has contributed $1 million to a group aiming to replace incumbent Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey with a more progressive prosecutor and $500,000 to support a voter referendum (Measure R) that mandates changes for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and reduces the jail population. Both contests will appear on the countywide ballot on March 3, also known as Super Tuesday.\n\nQuillin's $1 million donation went to an independent expenditure (IE) committee backing former San Francisco District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n, who is running to become L.A. County's top law enforcement official. The \"Run, George, Run: George Gasc\u00f3n for LA DA 2020\" committee includes national leaders from the criminal justice reform community, such as Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors. The committee has funded polling, billboard space, and produced a series of ads.\n\nDuring Gasc\u00f3n's eight-year tenure as San Francisco's District Attorney, he had the support of New York billionaire George Soros, who has spent over $20 million to promote like-minded prosecutor candidates throughout the United States. However, Mr. Soros has not been involved in the current race. The pro-Gasc\u00f3n IE's top individual donors, in addition to Quillin, include Liz Simons, the daughter of a retired hedge fund billionaire, who donated $500,000 last month.\n\nQuillin is the director of a fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a group that has awarded over $6 billion in grants since its formation in 2007. Both she and her husband are reportedly \"black label\" donors, meaning they have provided tens of millions of dollars or more to the institution. In 2012, Hastings and Quillin pledged to give half of their fortune to philanthropy or charitable causes.\n\nQuillin has also been identified as a financial supporter of a nonprofit publication called \"The Appeal,\" which focuses on local prosecutors and criminal justice policies. The outlet has published several articles critical of D.A. Lacey, and Gasc\u00f3n and his campaign have shared some of these stories on social media.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Protective League, which represents rank-and-file LAPD officers, has directed $1 million into its own political action committee opposing Gasc\u00f3n. The group recently released a 30-second television ad that began airing on Friday, focusing on his performance as San Francisco's District Attorney. The cop union mocked the Gasc\u00f3n campaign for labeling the spot \"racist.\"\n\nFormer public defender Rachel Rossi is also in the race. If none of the candidates receive more than 50% of the votes in next month's primary election, the top two vote-getters will compete in a runoff in November.",
    " Title: Forensic Pathologist Suggests Jeffrey Epstein's Death Was Homicide\n\nArticle:\n\nForensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden, who observed the autopsy of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier found dead in his Manhattan jail cell in August, has stated that the evidence points towards homicide rather than suicide. Baden, who was hired by Epstein's brother, Mark Epstein, made these remarks on Fox News on Wednesday.\n\nBaden noted several unusual findings during the autopsy, including two fractures on either side of Epstein's larynx and one on the hyoid bone, above the money manager's Adam's apple. He asserted that these fractures are not consistent with hanging and are more indicative of ligature homicidal strangulation.\n\n\"Hanging does not cause these broken bones, homicide does,\" Baden insisted on Fox. \"A huge amount of pressure was applied.\"\n\nBaden also called for federal prosecutors to release the findings from DNA samples taken during the autopsy, including information about whose DNA is on the torn strips of orange sheets used as a makeshift noose. He noted that the DNA from fingernail clippings taken from Epstein has not been released either.\n\nThe pathologist also questioned the supposed \"total breakdown in security\" surrounding Epstein's death, citing the \"extremely unlikely\" coincidence of two guards falling asleep while video cameras in Epstein's cell and hallway were also not working.\n\n\"Occasionally a guard falls asleep\u2014never two guards at the same time,\" Baden said on Fox. \"The issue would be, did somebody come in and cause his death?\"\n\nBaden admitted that there would be no shortage of people who might want to harm Epstein, given the numerous allegations of sex crimes against him. However, he stressed that a large number of people would have been involved if Epstein's death was a homicide.\n\n\"It's 80 days now and the brother feels he is getting a runaround,\" Baden said. \"He thinks that his brother wasn't the type to commit suicide but he wants to get the information that he hasn't been able to get so far.\"",

Kaepernick, 29, has been without a team since he opted out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers in March 2017.\n\nKaepernick first protested by sitting during the national anthem in August 2016, before opting to kneel instead. His actions inspired other players to follow suit, and criticism from President Donald Trump in September 2017 saw the protests spread.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, Kaepernick's lawyers wrote: \"We can confirm that this morning we filed a grievance under the CBA on behalf of Colin Kaepernick. This was done only after pursuing every possible avenue with all NFL teams and their executives.\"\n\nThe statement continued, \"If the NFL (as well as all professional sports leagues) is to remain a meritocracy, then principled and peaceful political protest - which the owners themselves made great theatre imitating weeks ago - should not be punished and athletes should not be denied employment.\"\n\nThe lawyers added, \"Such a precedent threatens all patriotic Americans and harkens back to our darkest days as a nation. Protecting all athletes from such collusive conduct is what compelled Mr. Kaepernick to file his grievance.\"\n\nKaepernick's goal, according to the statement, is \"to simply be treated fairly by the league he performed at the highest level for and to return to the football playing field.\"\n\nRobert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, told BBC Sport last week that he had \"never heard anyone talking about excluding\" Kaepernick. Some players from the 49ers again knelt during the anthem before their match on Sunday.\n\nColin Kaepernick started the NFL's \"take a knee\" protest movement in 2016, but many feel he has paid a high price for his political stance. After opting out of the final year of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers (the team said he would have been dropped regardless), he has not been picked up by another organization.\n\nThis is despite injuries to quarterbacks such as Marcus Mariota at the Tennessee Titans. Kaepernick had to watch on as others were given a trial. It seems he has grown tired of this situation and is now taking direct action.",
    " Title: U.S.-China Trade War to Impact Apple Inc. Starting This Weekend\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China will affect Apple Inc., the largest U.S. technology company, starting this weekend. The 15% tariffs, announced by President Donald Trump, will impact hundreds of products entering the U.S. or being withdrawn from warehouses for consumption in the U.S., according to the order.\n\nThe tariffs, as per the order, will take effect at 12:01 a.m. local time on Sunday in Washington. One veteran analyst, Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, expressed hope for a last-minute reprieve, stating that adding tariffs to any Apple product without some form of offset could have significant negative effects.\n\nHowever, any reprieve for Apple looked unlikely as Trump showed little sign of backing down. Apple did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe following is a list of Apple products that will be hit by 15% tariffs starting this weekend:\n\n1. Nand flash, a key storage component for iPhones\n2. Apple wearable gadgets\n\nThe iPhone, which contributes more than half of Apple's revenue, will not face this 15% tariff until December 15. However, other hardware products, which made up at least 10% of sales in the company's 2018 fiscal year, will have to absorb the 15% import levy that kicks in on Sunday.\n\nIt is unclear if Apple will raise product prices or assume the cost of the tariffs. The company, one of the world's most profitable, maintains higher margins than most other consumer hardware makers.\n\nA 15% tariff on Apple wearable gadgets sold in the U.S. could potentially reduce earnings by 5 cents to 10 cents a share per year, Munster estimated on Friday. Analysts, on average, estimate Apple's adjusted profit will be $11.63 a share in the 2019 fiscal year, according to data compiled by \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nApple has been lobbying Trump for more than a year to avoid tariffs. During a recent dinner with the president at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook voiced concerns that Apple's main rival Samsung Electronics Co. will gain an edge because its products won't be subject to the levies.\n\nJust days after that dinner, Trump announced that tariffs on $300 billion of goods from China would be 15%, up from 10%. These tariffs will take effect in two tranches, with the first batch happening on September 1.\n\nApple spent decades building one of the largest supply chains in the world. The company designs and sells most of its products in the U.S., but imports them from China after assembly. This makes it one of the most exposed companies to tariffs.",
    " Title: Private Industry and Technology as Potential Solutions for Rural America's Depopulation\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the confirmation hearing for Sonny Perdue, the presumptive Secretary of Agriculture, the former Georgia governor faced questions from both Republicans and Democrats regarding President Trump's budget for rural America. The opposition stemmed from concerns about the impact of the proposed budget on small, struggling rural communities.\n\nWhile many rural Americans agree with this assessment, it is also clear that these government programs are seen as a temporary solution to a long-standing economic issue. Rural counties, like those in the Midwest, have lost their competitive advantage to urban areas.\n\nTo address this challenge, political leaders in South Dakota, among other states, have implemented initiatives such as DakotaRoots.com, a recruitment tool designed to attract young workers. The program has been successful, with more than 4,000 people now calling South Dakota home due to the Dakota Roots program.\n\nHowever, critics argue that these initiatives, while laudable, are relatively modest in their impact. Rural America needs more than a few thousand people to rebuild its economy; it needs millions.\n\nTo achieve this, some propose leveraging the expertise of America's tech firms. These companies have developed algorithms to match people with potential romantic partners, taking into account user preferences and making informed guesses about compatibility.\n\nA similar approach could be applied to matching potential residents with rural communities. By using algorithms to sort cities based on user preferences for factors such as affordable housing, healthcare, schools, transportation, proximity to recreation, and low taxes, a \"top 10\" list of locations best suited to individual needs could be generated.\n\nStates and communities eager for new talent could then dedicate resources towards recruiting these prospective citizens. This approach is seen as a potential solution to the depopulation of rural areas, as young professionals and middle-class families increasingly seek better options due to stagnant wages, student debt, and the dream of homeownership.\n\nIn the end, rural communities face a choice: they can wait for more welfare programs to trickle down from Washington D.C., or they can collaborate with private industry to recapture the restless spirit of American workers on the move. The latter approach, with fewer bureaucrats involved, is seen by some as the path to making rural America truly great again.",
    " Title: Warren Apologizes to Cherokee Nation for DNA Test Amidst 2020 Presidential Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat representing Massachusetts, has reportedly apologized to the Cherokee Nation leadership over a DNA test she undertook to prove Native American ancestry. The apology comes as Warren is set to announce her presidential bid for 2020, amidst ongoing discussions about her ancestry that have been a recurring issue in her political career.\n\nWarren, who established an exploratory committee for the presidential run on New Year's Eve, has been touring the nation in preparation for her anticipated announcement to join the growing pool of Democrats vying for the White House. However, the issue of her ancestry has resurfaced, a matter that is likely to persist during her campaign.\n\nBefore expressing her presidential aspirations, Warren released the results of a DNA test, aiming to quell questions about her ancestry. The test indicated Native American heritage but faced criticism from tribal leaders and backlash that has marked her initial months of campaigning.\n\nAccording to The Intercept and the New York Times, Warren privately reached out to Cherokee Nation leadership and apologized for the test and any harm it may have caused. Cherokee Nation spokeswoman Julie Hubbard told The Intercept, \"Senator Warren has reached out to us and has apologized to the tribe.\" She added, \"We are encouraged by this dialogue and understanding that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws, not through DNA tests.\"\n\nWarren released the results from the DNA test in October, which showed \"strong evidence\" of Native American ancestry, partly in response to criticism from Republicans, including President Donald Trump, who nicknamed her \"Pocahontas.\"\n\nConservatives have accused Warren of claiming Cherokee heritage to gain favor for jobs that boosted her career, a claim her former employers have denied. Last month, Warren addressed the test during a question-and-answer session with supporters at a rally in Iowa.\n\nAn audience member asked, \"Why did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald Trump more fodder to be a bully?\" Warren responded, \"I am not a person of color. I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry.\"\n\nWarren explained that when she ran for public office for the first time in 2012, Republicans \"honed in on this part of my history\" and made \"racial slurs.\" She added, \"My decision was, I'm just going to put it all out there.\"\n\n\"I can't stop Donald Trump from what he's going to do. I can't stop him from hurling racial insults,\" Warren said. \"But what I can do is I can be in this fight for all of our families.\"",
    " Title: Syrian President Assad Questions U.S. Commitment to Defeat ISIS, Labels U.S. Troops in Syria as \"Invaders\"\n\nArticle:\n\nSyrian President Bashar Assad has expressed doubts about the U.S.'s commitment to defeating the Islamic State (ISIS) group, stating that he has not seen any concrete actions from the Trump administration to back up the president's rhetoric. In an interview published on Saturday, Assad expressed hope that the current U.S. administration will follow through on their promises.\n\nTrump's campaign platform included a pledge to eradicate ISIS, and upon taking office in late January, he ordered his top military leaders to present a new plan to dismantle the terror group within 30 days. However, it is unclear whether they have delivered a report to Trump.\n\nAssad also suggested that the U.S.-backed military effort against ISIS in Syria has been limited, describing it as \"only a few raids.\" Despite this, Assad remains optimistic about potential cooperation between his regime and the Trump administration, although he did not elaborate on this point.\n\nThe interview, which was approximately 27 minutes long, was conducted by the Chinese TV station Phoenix and was posted on Syria's state-news agency SANA on Saturday.\n\nCritics, particularly among Republicans and military hawks, have been critical of former President Obama's handling of ISIS and his dealings with Assad. They argue that Obama and his administration failed to acknowledge \"radical Islamic terrorism\" and did not follow through on a 2012 statement that Assad would cross a \"red line\" in using chemical weapons on civilians after evidence of such attacks became apparent.\n\nISIS has gained ground in largely northern and remote regions of Syria during the six-year civil war. U.S. military leaders have primarily limited their public comments about the war on ISIS to efforts in Iraq, particularly in west Mosul. However, they announced earlier this week that the U.S. is preparing to send around 400 additional support troops to Syria, in addition to the roughly 500 already in the country, for a multi-national effort to defeat ISIS in their stronghold of Raqqa.\n\nAssad stated in the interview that winning in Raqqa was a priority for his regime, and he considered any foreign troops entering Syria without his permission as \"invaders,\" regardless of their nationality.",
    " Title: Gun Control Ads Cause Concern for Democratic Leadership Over Vulnerable Senator Mark Pryor\n\nArticle:\n\nGun control legislation has become a source of concern for the Democratic leadership, as the party braces for potential backlash from pro-gun control advocates. According to several sources, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's aides recently met with staffers of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to discuss the potential impact of targeting vulnerable Democrats, such as Arkansas's Mark Pryor, on gun control issues.\n\nAdvertisements from the Bloomberg-funded Mayors Against Illegal Guns are set to air soon in Alaska, Arkansas, and North Dakota \u2013 states with Democratic senators who opposed the White House on the recent background checks vote. The group is also planning to deploy up to 60 field organizers in about a dozen states where senators, both Democrats and Republicans, voted against the bill. The goal is to build infrastructure and counter the influence of gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association.\n\nThe increased focus on gun control has Democrats worried about maintaining their hold on the Senate, as they face opposition not only from Republicans but also from pro-gun control forces. Gun control legislation has gained momentum since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012, which left 20 children and six adults dead. However, advocates acknowledge that they cannot overcome the power of the NRA on Capitol Hill unless those who oppose them face electoral consequences for their actions.\n\nIn Arkansas, the group's radio spots will target the state's African-American community, a demographic that Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, believes is crucial for Mark Pryor's reelection. Four Senate Democrats \u2013 Pryor, Max Baucus of Montana, Mark Begich of Alaska, and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota \u2013 joined with Republicans to derail the bill, drawing criticism from the gun control movement and complaints from the White House.\n\nHowever, it is Pryor's fate that has Democratic leadership most worried. Senate Democrats point to the example of former Arkansas Democratic Senator Blanche Lincoln as a warning. In 2010, labor unions, angered by Lincoln's vote against legislation they supported, helped fund a primary challenger. Lincoln narrowly won the primary, but was then defeated by Republican John Boozman in the general election.\n\nDemocratic senators and aides also note that Pryor has supported President Barack Obama and the leadership on other significant issues such as Obamacare, banking reform, and taxes. Reid will need Pryor's support on upcoming immigration votes.",
    " Title: Advertisers Pull Out of Laura Ingraham's Fox News Show Following Controversial Tweets\n\nArticle:\n\nAt least seven companies have announced they are discontinuing advertisements on Laura Ingraham's Fox News show following her controversial tweets about a survivor of the Florida school massacre. The conservative pundit's comments sparked a call for a boycott from Parkland student David Hogg, who survived the February 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\nHogg, 17, tweeted a list of a dozen companies that advertise on \"The Ingraham Angle\" and urged his supporters to demand that they cancel their ads. Hogg, who has become a prominent figure in the youth-led movement advocating for tighter firearm restrictions, took aim at Ingraham after she mocked him on Twitter over his college applications.\n\nOn Thursday, Ingraham issued an apology \"in the spirit of Holy Week,\" stating that she was sorry for any hurt or upset she may have caused Hogg or the \"brave victims\" of Parkland. Ingraham also noted that her show was one of the first to feature Hogg after the shooting and praised his poise given the tragedy.\n\nNutrish, a pet food line created by celebrity chef Rachael Ray, travel website TripAdvisor Inc (TRIP.O), online home furnishings seller Wayfair Inc (W.N), the world's largest packaged food company, Nestle SA (NESN.S), online streaming service Hulu, travel website Expedia Group Inc (EXPE.O), and online personal shopping service Stitch Fix (SFIX.O) all confirmed they were canceling their advertisements.\n\nWayfair stated in a statement that while they support dialogue and debate, Ingraham's personal criticism of a high school student who had lost classmates in an unspeakable tragedy was not consistent with their values. Nutrish tweeted that they were in the process of removing their ads from Ingraham's program. Nestle stated they had \"no plans to buy ads on the show in future.\" Hulu confirmed they were no longer advertising on Ingraham's show and were monitoring all ad placements carefully.\n\nTripAdvisor, which was not on Hogg's list or another list of sponsors that Hogg retweeted, stated they no longer advertise on this show. Expedia, which was not on Hogg's list, also confirmed they no longer advertise on Ingraham's show.\n\nHogg wrote on Twitter that an apology to mollify advertisers was insufficient. He stated he would accept an apology only if Ingraham denounced the way Fox News treated him and his friends. \"It's time to love thy neighbor, not mudsling at children,\" Hogg tweeted.\n\nIngraham's show airs on Fox News, part of Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O).",
    " Title: Trump Promises to Repeal Johnson Amendment, Courting Social Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to appeal to social conservatives, former President Donald J. Trump, speaking at the 11th Annual Values Voters Summit on Friday, pledged to repeal the Johnson Amendment, a provision that prohibits churches and other tax-exempt organizations from endorsing political candidates.\n\nSince securing the Republican nomination and shifting focus to the general election against Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump has been reaching out to social conservatives, a significant segment of the Republican coalition. During his speech, he emphasized, \"The first thing we have to do is to give our churches their voice back. I will repeal the Johnson Amendment if I am elected your president.\"\n\nIn a jocular tone, Mr. Trump suggested that repealing the 1950s-era provision named after then-Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson might be the only way he could gain entry into heaven.\n\nThe 2016 election saw questions about the support of social conservatives, who are traditionally active in political campaigns, for Mr. Trump due to his stance on abortion, his two divorces, and high-profile extramarital affairs in the 1990s. To address these concerns, Mr. Trump has highlighted his children, who have won praise from even skeptical conservatives, and chosen Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a well-respected social conservative, as his running mate.\n\nOn policy matters, Mr. Trump has promised to nominate Supreme Court justices who will uphold the Constitution, defend \"religious liberty,\" repeal and replace Obamacare, and fight to expand school choice for students in failing schools.\n\n\"Let me state this upfront: in a Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be protected and defended like you have never seen before,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trump has also assembled high-profile figures to his Evangelical Advisory Board, including Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council, which hosted the summit, and former Rep. Michele Bachmann. Bachmann praised Mr. Trump's stances on immigration, foreign policy, and taxes.\n\n\"On every single level, if you look at the agenda that Donald Trump has put forward, it has been one that I, as a Constitutional conservative, as a believer in Jesus Christ, can not only easily embrace, but readily embrace,\" Mrs. Bachmann said.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus urged, \"Let's lock arms and do what we can to elect Donald Trump president of the United States.\"\n\n\"The Left is launching an assault on our culture. They want to strip God out of the public square. Our nation's religious heritage has helped make us what we are today. No America with religious convictions will have to bow at the altar of secularism if Donald Trump is president,\" Mr. Priebus said.\n\nSandra Seaver of Maine expressed her support, stating, \"I used to hold my nose and vote for Trump, but since he has become more presidential, I have been very impressed with him.\"\n\nOther attendees acknowledged that Mr. Trump might not be the ideal candidate for them, but his resistance to political correctness and his opposition to Hillary Clinton made him an acceptable choice.\n\n\"If you don't vote for Trump, it is essentially a vote for Hillary,\" said Jim Chamberlin, of Ohio.",
    " Title: Obama Defends Susan Rice Amidst Benghazi Criticism, Threatens Political Battle Over Nominations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated news conference on Wednesday, President Barack Obama defended his handling of the September 11 terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya's second-largest city and criticized Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham for attacking his top aide, U.N. Ambassador Susan E. Rice. The two senators have stated that Rice's inaccurate account of the cause of the Benghazi attacks makes her unfit for promotion, and they have threatened to block her if she is nominated to succeed Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nDuring the conference, Obama defended Rice, stating that she had nothing to do with the Benghazi incident and was merely presenting intelligence she had received. He accused the senators of besmirching her reputation and called their attacks outrageous.\n\nTwo hours before the news conference, McCain and Graham announced their intention to block Rice should the president nominate her to succeed Clinton. McCain criticized Rice for her account of the Benghazi attack on five Sunday political talk shows, stating that she said the incident was the result of a mob protest against an anti-Islamic video. Graham also criticized Rice's handling of China and Russia during tough negotiations at the United Nations.\n\nAfter Obama's response, Graham retorted that he does blame Obama and formally introduced a resolution calling for a special select committee to investigate Benghazi. He stated that he does not want a fight but has a firm resolve to investigate the incident further.\n\nThe exchange highlights what could be a bumpy road in the second term for some of Obama's potential nominees, as many departments and agencies that played a role in the Benghazi incident could face vacancies in their top posts. Clinton has stated she will be leaving the State Department, and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta has not indicated whether he will leave or stay put. The president may also have to fill the Pentagon's top civilian job.\n\nIn addition, CIA Director David H. Petraeus left his key national security post open with his surprise resignation and admission last week of an extramarital affair. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who has faced scrutiny over the Justice Department's ill-fated Fast and Furious gunwalking scandal, is also expected to move to the private sector early in Obama's second term.\n\nThe Justice Department's supervisory role in the unusual FBI investigation into Petraeus' personal life and the FBI's failure to inform the president of its probe until months after it had begun will complicate the confirmation process of any Holder successor.\n\nObama defended Rice, stating that she had done \"exemplary work\" as U.N. ambassador and that the senators now have \"a problem with me\" for taking her to task. However, he did not announce any more nominations at this point and stated he has not decided whether to nominate Rice.\n\nMcCain and Graham earlier stated they would do \"whatever is necessary\" to stop Rice from becoming the next secretary of state if Obama does pick her. Senator John F. Kerry, Massachusetts Democrat, is also reportedly under consideration for Clinton's job. Graham stated he does not have any concerns about Kerry, but his idea for a select committee to investigate Benghazi is meeting with resistance from top Democrats, who stated there are multiple committees already looking into the run-up to the attack and the slow U.S. military response.\n\nAmbassador J. Christopher Stevens, who was one of four Americans killed in the attack, had asked for more security, but his request was denied. There were several warnings of increased terrorist activity, including an attack on the consulate in June, which Graham stated Obama must answer whether he knew about. A Defense Department timeline released last week showed the military took hours to get a security team to the site of the attack.\n\nObama in his news conference defended his own handling of the attack, stating that his orders to his national security team were to do whatever was necessary to make the Americans safe. When pressed during the news conference to provide more answers to the families of the victims of the Benghazi attacks, Obama stated he would address the families directly, not through the press. However, he also referred to an ongoing investigation, stating he and the administration would \"provide all the information that is available about what happened that day.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the bloody civil war in Syria, Obama stated that he is encouraged that the Syria opposition has formed a new, more representative leadership council, but that the U.S. is not ready to recognize the group as a \"government in exile\" or to arm it. The president also pledged to try to engage Iran in negotiations over its disputed nuclear program, stating he would not be \"constrained by diplomatic niceties and protocols\" even though he believes there is \"still a window of time for us to resolve this diplomatically.\"",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's Allegations Against Mitt Romney's Tax History Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate over Mitt Romney's tax history escalated on Sunday, as Republican figures criticized Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for his claim that Romney, the presumed Republican presidential candidate, has not paid taxes for the past 10 years.\n\nDuring an appearance on ABC's \"This Week,\" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus labeled Reid a \"dirty liar who hasn't filed a single page of tax returns himself.\" When asked by show moderator George Stephanopoulos if he stood by his comment, Priebus responded, \"I just said it.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) also criticized Reid on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" stating, \"What he did on the Senate floor is so out of bounds. I think he's lying about his statement of knowing something about Romney.\"\n\nVirginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) called Reid's comments \"reckless and slanderous.\" On CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" McDonnell said, \"We know about [Romney's] tax returns? He's paid his taxes.\" He added that \"people don't care about Mitt Romney's tax returns\" and accused Democrats of making an issue of Romney's tax returns to divert attention from President Obama's handling of the economy.\n\nDemocrats have persisted in their claim and have raised more questions about Romney's personal fortune, estimated to be as much as $250 million. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), who heads the Democratic National Committee, said on ABC's \"This Week,\" \"There are questions that, when you're running for president of the United States, that the American people deserve answers to.\"\n\nRomney has refused to release more than one year of personal tax returns, citing concerns that the information could be distorted and used against him. There is no legal requirement that presidential candidates release their taxes, although it has become customary in recent decades.\n\nReid's initial allegation last week, that he had learned from an investor in Romney's former firm, Bain Capital, that Romney had not paid taxes, has not been substantiated. Reid has not offered proof and has stated that he is unsure whether his claim is true. He repeated the accusation on the Senate floor, a move Republicans characterized as politically motivated and inappropriate. Senators cannot be sued for defamation over statements made on the chamber floor.\n\nSince his initial charge, Reid has doubled down on his insinuation and stated that he does not need to prove it. \"I don't think the burden should be on me,\" he said in a telephone call with Nevada reporters last week. \"The burden should be on him. He's the one I've alleged has not paid any taxes. Why didn't he release his tax returns?\"\n\nReid spokesman Adam Jentleson, in an email on Sunday regarding the attacks on Reid, said the unnamed source is \"extremely credible\" and accused Republicans of trying to \"cover up for Mitt Romney's stonewalling.\"\n\n\"This issue is not going away until Romney decides to be straight with the American people and release his tax returns,\" Mr. Jentleson said.\n\nHowever, late last week, Romney himself emphatically stated that he would not release the returns and dared Reid \"to put up or shut up.\"\n\n\"Harry's going to have to describe who it is he spoke with, because of course that's totally and completely wrong. It's untrue, dishonest, and inaccurate. It's wrong,\" Romney told Fox News' Sean Hannity on his radio show. \"So I'm looking forward to have Harry reveal his sources, and we'll probably find out it's the White House.\"\n\nNo Democrat appearing on Sunday's news talk shows disavowed Reid's comments, which Republicans said last week smacked of McCarthyism in their use of anonymous sources to make insinuations that the accused must then disprove. Rather than disavowing Reid's claims, most Democrats instead tried to turn the conversation away from him and instead on Romney.\n\nDavid Axelrod, Obama's senior campaign adviser, told \"Fox News Sunday\" that he didn't know the identity of Reid's source but that \"Gov. Romney can resolve this in 10 seconds. They can release the tax returns.\"\n\nRobert Gibbs, an adviser to Obama and his former press secretary, was asked on CNN's \"State of the Union\" whether Reid should tamp down his accusations against Romney. \"I don't think anybody controls Harry Reid,\" was his reply.\n\nWhen pressed again by show moderator Candy Crowley whether Reid should drop the issue, Gibbs said instead that \"Harry Reid isn't the one who's made this debate. Mitt Romney has brought this to the fore.\"",
    " Title: Presidential Authority to Kill: Legal and Ethical Implications of Trump's Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump ordered the U.S. military to invade Iraq, a previously friendly country, without the knowledge or consent of its government, and assassinated a visiting foreign government official. The victim was the head of Iran's military and intelligence. The killing, which occurred through the use of an unmanned drone, took place as the general and his companions were driving on a public highway in a van. The general was not engaged in an act of violence at the time of his death, nor were any of his companions.\n\nThe president's supporters have argued that the general's death was revenge for Americans and others killed by the general's troops and surrogates. Trump has argued that he ordered the general's death because of what evil the general might order his own troops and surrogates to do in the future.\n\nThe question arises: Can the president legally kill a person not engaged in an act of violence because of what the person might do in the future? The president has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution, which provides only two means for the federal government to kill a human being. The first is pursuant to a declaration of war, which only Congress can do. The second way that the Constitution permits federal government killings is pursuant to due process. That means that the person to be killed is lawfully in custody, has been properly charged, lawfully tried and fairly convicted of a capital crime, and the conviction has been upheld on appeal.\n\nCan the president kill foreign military personnel and claim the justification of self-defense? The laws of war permit him to do that, but self-defense\u2014actually, defense of the country\u2014only comes into play when the foreign military personnel are physically engaged in killing Americans or are certainly about to do so. That justification only applies when force is imminent and certain. Were imminence and certainty not the requirement, then nothing would prevent a president from slaying any monster he chose simply based on a fear that the monster might someday strike. Such a state of affairs is contrary to two presidential executive orders, one issued by President Gerald R. Ford and the other by President Ronald Reagan, and neither negated by Trump.\n\nSuch a territorial invasion and killing also violate the United Nations Charter\u2014a treaty that prohibits unlawful invasions and killings of member nations' territories and officials outside of a lawful and U.N. approved declaration of war. Roaming the world looking for monsters to slay not only violates long-standing principles of American domestic and international law, but also it violates basic Judeo-Christian moral principles, which teach that the end does not justify the means and might does not make right.\n\nThe question of whether the American president can kill an Iranian government official in Iraq because of fear of what he might do\u2014without a declaration of war or any legal process\u2014raises concerns about the rule of law, personal liberty, and limited government. It also raises questions about the safety of the people, as laws are in place to prevent wanton killings, lest killers turn on us.\n\nIn Robert Bolt's play \"A Man for All Seasons,\" Sir Thomas More argues with his son-in-law, William Roper, about the extent of the law's protections of those universally recognized as evil. Roper says that he would cut down all the laws in England to get rid of the Devil. More counters that even the Devil is entitled to the benefits of the law. Then he hurls this zinger: \"And, when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you?\u2014where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast\u2014man's laws, not God's\u2014and, if you cut them down\u2014and you're just the man to do it\u2014d'you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.\"\n\nMore crystalized the dangers of those who\u2014like Trump\u2014take the law into their own hands for the sake of expedience or to rid the world of a monster. Without law, how does one decide what monsters should go and what monsters may stay?\n\nWhen President Obama used drones to kill peaceful, uncharged Americans in Yemen, candidate Donald Trump condemned that behavior. He offered that, as president, he would bring the troops home, stop the nation building, quit being the world's police force, and end the endless wars. Instead, his act of state terrorism has succeeded in doing what the general he killed could never do while alive. Trump has united the Iranian people behind their fanatical government, and he caused the Iraqi government to kick out all American troops\u2014troops that had no lawful or moral basis for being there in the first place, and whose numbers have only increased.\n\nTrump cut down the laws to get to the Devil. Whom will he kill next? Judge Andrew P. Napolitano was the youngest life-tenured Superior Court judge in the history of New Jersey. He is Fox News\u2019 senior judicial analyst. He has been published in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and numerous other publications. He is the author of the best-seller, \"Lies the Government Told You: Myth, Power, and Deception in American History.\" For more of Judge Napolitano's reports, Go Here Now.",
    " Title: Orlando Nightclub Shooting: Investigation Ongoing as Political Debate Erupts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe FBI has identified the perpetrator of the Orlando nightclub shooting as 29-year-old Omar Mateen, a U.S. citizen of Afghan descent. The FBI Director, James Comey, has stated that there is no evidence suggesting the attack was directed from the Middle East, labeling Mateen as a \"homegrown extremist.\"\n\nMateen, who was once under FBI surveillance for nearly a year, was allowed to purchase firearms despite his past surveillance. Witnesses have reported that Mateen was a regular at the Pulse nightclub and had dated men. Officials also claim Mateen scouted Disney World for a potential attack.\n\nThe shooting has significantly impacted the ongoing U.S. presidential campaign. Following President Barack Obama's refusal to mention \"Muslim\" or \"Islamic terrorism\" in his statement on the Orlando massacre, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump expanded his proposed Muslim ban. Trump's proposal now aims to close the U.S. borders to individuals from countries with a history of Islamic terrorism, regardless of their religion.\n\nTrump accused Obama of willful ignorance regarding Islamic terrorism, stating, \"There's something going on.\" Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton initially followed Obama's politically correct line, but later acknowledged the threat of \"radical Islamism.\"\n\nThe political debate has focused on gun control and anti-terror legislation, with the Democratic response during a raucous session of Congress focusing on gun control legislation. However, Republican opposition has halted the proposed legislation.\n\nInvestigators continue to gather more information about Mateen, the deadliest mass shooter in American history.

    " Title: Immigrant Households in the U.S. Use Welfare at Higher Rates Than Native-Born Counterparts, According to New Study\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study released by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) indicates that 51 percent of immigrant-headed households, both legal and illegal, reported using at least one welfare program in 2012. This is compared to 30 percent of native-headed households that used at least one welfare program.\n\nThe report, authored by CIS's Director of Research Steven Camarota, analyzed welfare data from the Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The CIS's definition of welfare includes Medicaid, cash, food, and housing programs.\n\nCamarota stated, \"If immigration is supposed to benefit the country, then immigrant welfare use should be much lower than native use. However, two decades after welfare reform tried to curtail immigrant welfare use, immigrant households are using most programs at higher rates than natives.\"\n\nCamarota noted that the skill and education level of many current immigrants is contributing to their welfare use. He added, \"The low-skill level of many immigrants means that although most work, many also access welfare programs. If we continue to allow large numbers of less-educated immigrants to settle in the country, then immigrant welfare use will remain high.\"\n\nWhile welfare use among both new and long-time immigrants is high, with 48 percent of immigrants in the U.S. for more than 20 years reporting welfare use, the rates vary based on region of origin. In 2012, 73 percent of immigrant-headed households from Central America and Mexico reported using one or more welfare program. Households from the Caribbean used welfare at a rate of 51 percent, African immigrants were at 48 percent, South America at 41 percent, East Asia 32 percent, Europe 26 percent, and South Asia 17 percent.\n\nThe report also highlights that while immigrant-headed households use welfare at a higher rate than natives, they also pay taxes at a lower rate. \"On average, immigrant-headed households had tax liability in income and payroll taxes in 2012 that was about 11 percent less than native households, or about 89 cents for every dollar native households pay, based on Census Bureau data. Immigrant households have lower average incomes (from all sources) than native households and are a good deal larger, giving them more tax deductions. As a result, their average income tax liability is less than native households,\" the report reads.",
    " Title: Florida Voters Approve Measure to Restore Voting Rights for 1.4 Million Felons\n\nArticle:\n\nFlorida voters approved Amendment 4 on Tuesday, a ballot measure that will restore voting rights to an estimated 1.4 million people with felony records in the state. The amendment, which passed by 64 percent, will re-enfranchise all felons in the state, except those convicted of murder or sex offenses.\n\nThe amendment was supported by various groups, including progressive organizations, civil liberty organizations, conservative groups aligned with the Koch brothers, and celebrities. It also received grassroots support from ex-offenders and their families who argue that those who have paid their debt to society should be returned to full citizenship.\n\nDesmond Meade, president of Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, addressed a room of overjoyed supporters at an election night watch party in Orlando, stating, \"This was a campaign about inclusion. Those numbers represented what happens when we come together along the lines of humanity and reach each other where we're at. That's what happens when we're able to transcend partisan politics and bickering, when we're able to transcend racial anxieties and discourse, when we're able to come together as God's children.\"\n\nFlorida was one of four states that imposed lifetime bans on voting for people with felony records. The two remaining states are Iowa and Kentucky. Virginia has a similar provision, but the last two governors have used their executive powers to restore voting rights of those affected.\n\nThirty-three states have various laws disenfranchising felony offenders and those under law enforcement supervision, impacting an estimated 6.1 million potential voters, according to a 2016 Sentencing Project report.\n\nFormer offenders in Florida could petition the governor for clemency to have their voting rights restored, but in 2011, then-governor Rick Scott, who is running for the U.S. Senate this year, rewrote the rules, making Florida the toughest state in the U.S. for felons to regain their voting rights.\n\nBryan Russi, 42, an ex-felon and current real estate agent from Orlando, stated, \"Ultimately, we are citizens, we are in the community, we do want to have a say\u2014I know I do\u2014and this is a great way to have that opportunity.\" Russi added, \"It's not Republican or Democrat, it's a human thing. Everyone has people who have been affected.\"\n\nKim Lawrance, an activist whose 18-year-old daughter is currently incarcerated, expressed her hope that her child would be able to vote one day. \"They should be able to come home and get reintegrated into society,\" Lawrance said. \"When your time is done, it's done.\"\n\nOne estimate suggests that 10 percent of all Floridians who are otherwise eligible to vote have been disenfranchised by the law. Felon disenfranchisement also disproportionately affects black residents. One out of every 13 African-Americans in the U.S. has lost their voting rights due to felony disenfranchisement laws, compared to one in every 56 non-black voters, the Sentencing Project report said.\n\nFlorida's felony disenfranchisement laws were, like those in many other states, a vestige of the state's racist 19th-century \"Black Codes,\" which attempted to systematically criminalize freed slaves following the Civil War and then bar them from voting.\n\nIn a statement, ACLU of Florida Executive Director Howard Simon celebrated what he called \"one of the largest expansions of the franchise in our nation's history\" but warned that the fight was not over. Simon stated, \"In the days and weeks ahead, we will seek to work with the newly elected governor to ensure that Amendment 4 is implemented as intended by the Floridians who placed it on the ballot and voted to approve it\u2014without delay and without imposing more burdens on the process to register to vote.\"\n\nShortly after Amendment 4 passed, Trump-aligned Republican Ron DeSantis narrowly defeated progressive Democrat Andrew Gillum in the race for Florida governor.",
    " Title: Obama and Trump Meet for First Time at White House, Discussing Peaceful Transition of Power\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a historic meeting at the White House, President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump discussed the transition of power on Thursday. The two men, who were intense rivals during the 2016 election, spoke well of each other and shook hands for the cameras.\n\nJust days after a campaign marked by vicious attacks, the two leaders pledged to work together to address the challenges facing the United States. Obama stated that his \"number one priority\" in the next two months in office is to facilitate the transition to the Trump administration.\n\nThe two leaders discussed \"organizational issues\" and both domestic and foreign policies. Obama emphasized the importance of unity, stating, \"I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face.\"\n\nTrump, who famously challenged Obama's birthplace, called his predecessor \"a very good man\" following their Oval Office meeting. The New York businessman also said, \"We had never met each other. I have great respect.\"\n\nThe two shook hands for the cameras, but did not take questions from reporters. After the meeting, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the two leaders did not resolve all of their differences, but did not try to either; their focus was a smooth transition.\n\nTrump later met with Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Trump and Ryan spoke of a \"fantastic, productive meeting about getting to work.\"\n\nIn his campaign, Trump pledged to reverse and tear down many of Obama's policies, including his health care law, the Iran nuclear deal, and business and environmental regulations. However, in his victory speech, Trump called for unity, stating, \"It's time for America to bind the wounds of division.\"\n\nThe Trump team is also putting together possible picks for the Cabinet and White House staff. While Obama and Trump spoke in the Oval Office, first lady Michelle Obama gave a tour of the residence to Melania Trump. During the campaign, Mrs. Obama criticized Trump over his lewd comments about women, while Mrs. Trump, during her address to the Republican national convention, used lines cribbed from a speech the first lady had once given.\n\nObama and Trump's rivalry, intrinsic to the 2016 election, goes back years. During Obama's first term, Trump made a name for himself by becoming the de facto leader of the so-called \"birther\" movement, pushing the false idea that the president was not born in the United States. In this past campaign year, Clinton described the birther movement as a racist attack on the nation's first African-American president. In 2011, Obama responded by producing a long-form birth certificate and mocking Trump at a high-profile press dinner as the New York businessman sat in the audience. At the White House on Wednesday, Obama said he wants to make sure the presidential succession is \"well executed because ultimately we're all on the same team.\"",
    " Title: Republicans Lead in Competitive 2014 Midterm Races Due to Low Obama Approval, Discontent with Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by Politico between May 2-13, Republicans are leading in the most competitive House and Senate races for the 2014 midterm elections. The poll surveyed 867 likely voters, with 41 percent indicating they would choose a Republican candidate, compared to 34 percent who would choose a Democrat. Approximately 25 percent of respondents were undecided.\n\nThe poll results reflect President Barack Obama's low job approval rating and public disenchantment with the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Politico stated that both the president's job approval and the partisan ballot matchup are more negative for Democrats in this poll than in other national surveys, indicating a challenging political landscape for the Democratic Party.\n\nHowever, the poll also showed that in a number of conservative states and races that could be a toss-up, voters lean in the liberal direction on several issues on the Democratic Party agenda, including immigration reform, pay equity, and background checks for gun sales. Healthcare, however, is a higher priority for voters, with nearly 9 out of 10 people stating their view on healthcare would be an important determinant of their vote.\n\nAmong those surveyed who had an opinion of the Affordable Care Act, the electorate was almost evenly split between those who want to repeal the law entirely (48 percent) and those who favor either leaving it alone (16 percent) or keeping it in place with modifications (35 percent). The poll suggests that fully repealing the ACA may not be a straightforward political proposition for the Republican Party, and could be a more complex issue for a GOP presidential ticket to navigate in 2016.\n\nThe survey also found that majorities of white voters (54 percent) and men (51 percent) support repealing Obamacare, but a majority of most subgroups do not support repeal, including independents, moderates, African-Americans, and Hispanics. The midterm electorate is expected to be whiter and more conservative than the country as a whole, and many of the year's highest-stakes Senate races are in Southern states, such as Arkansas, North Carolina, and Louisiana. Therefore, even if the law has gained some legitimacy with the broader public, it remains ominous for Democrats that repeal is the plurality position of likely voters.",
    " Title: President Trump Visits Puerto Rico Amidst Ongoing Hurricane Maria Recovery Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is currently on a trip to the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, following criticism from local politicians regarding the administration's response to Hurricane Maria. During a press conference last week, President Trump described the hurricane's aftermath as \"wiped out\" and \"never seen anything like it.\"\n\nThe president is expected to spend at least five hours in Puerto Rico, during which he will meet with first responders, local politicians, some residents, and Marine Corps and Navy personnel, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump. The itinerary includes meetings with Governor Ricardo Rossell, a visit to a local church, and attending briefings.\n\nThis visit marks Trump's fourth trip to a region affected by natural disasters, including Texas, Florida, Louisiana, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. However, some Puerto Rican politicians have criticized the administration's response to the disaster, with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz stating during a press conference last Friday that the administration's inefficiency is contributing to a \"genocide\" if the crisis is not handled.\n\nTrump has responded to the criticism by tweeting that the Mayor of San Juan and other Puerto Rican politicians lack leadership ability and are not helping their workers. He also claimed that 10,000 federal workers are on the island providing vital recovery support, a figure reported by FEMA. Nearly 50 percent of people now have access to drinking water, according to FEMA.\n\nHurricane Maria has exacerbated Puerto Rico's already dire economic situation, as the territory has been in economic recession for about a decade and undergoing a debt crisis. The economic woes have left the country's infrastructure in a poor state, making the recovery process more challenging.\n\nAs of now, more than 90 percent of residents are still without power, and some hospitals reportedly have no power as well. Rural areas continue to struggle to access essential needs such as food, fresh water, or medicine.\n\nThe purpose of Trump's visit is believed to be addressing the perception that the administration has neglected the response to the crisis. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders stated on Monday that the trip is about the recovery, to which the administration is \"fully committed.\"\n\n\"The top priority for the federal government is certainly to protect the lives and the safety of those in affected areas and provide life-sustaining services as we work together to rebuild their lives,\" Sanders said.",
    " Title: Protesters Demand Town Hall Meetings with Sen. Dianne Feinstein During Recess\n\nArticle:\n\nDemonstrators protested Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) on Friday outside the Public Policy Institute of California in San Francisco, expressing their disapproval of her decision not to hold town hall meetings during the current congressional recess.\n\nAccording to the San Francisco Chronicle, Sen. Feinstein, who has not held town hall meetings during her last two U.S. Senate campaigns, has no plans for any town halls during the current recess. People attending Feinstein's ticketed event were invited to send questions via email to the event moderator in advance, with free tickets available. There were reportedly only 240 chairs in the room, although many more were standing.\n\nDuring the event, Feinstein reportedly enjoyed the outbursts from the protesters, as reported by The Sacramento Bee. The protesters were from the San Francisco chapter of Indivisible, a liberal group that has disrupted talks in recent weeks to push their \"anti-Donald Trump\" agenda. They held up signs reading, \"Hold a real town hall,\" and others held up a green \"agree\" and a red \"disagree\" sign.\n\nAt another point during the event, Feinstein reportedly said there was not much she could do to remove Stephen K. Bannon from his position as President Trump's chief White House strategist, which prompted the activists to hold up a red \"disagree\" sign.\n\nFriday's protest was not the first time Feinstein's constituents have confronted her. In January, approximately 200 protesters opposed what they have labeled as her \"pro-Trump voting record\" because she voted for confirming several of the president's Cabinet picks.\n\nOn Friday night, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) held a town hall in Glendale, California, where he discussed President Donald Trump's temporary travel ban and the refugee crisis.\n\nSeveral hundred anti-Trump activists will also hold an \"empty chair\" town hall on Sunday at 10 a.m., despite the fact that Feinstein will not attend in person. A spokeswoman for Indivisible East Bay told the Chronicle that Sunday \"is not really a protest\" of the senator. \"It's a demonstration of our request that she meet with us.\"",
    " Title: ISIS Attempts Suicide Bombing on U.S. Airbase Training Iraqi Forces\n\nArticle:\n\nISIS forces, dressed in Iraqi military uniforms, attempted a suicide bomb attack on an airbase in Iraq where 320 U.S. Marines are training Iraqi forces. The attack occurred in the town of Baghdadi, which is less than five miles from the base. The attack was thwarted by Iraqi Security Forces, resulting in the death of the ISIS fighters.\n\nThe proximity of ISIS and American military personnel raises concerns, particularly as President Obama seeks authorization from Congress for the use of force, which rejects the notion of \"enduring offensive ground forces.\" The incident highlights the potential risks of American military personnel engaging with ISIS on the battlefield.\n\nRear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, stated that the base, which is roughly the size of Boulder, Colorado, has \"mini-bases inside the big base.\" He added that the incident occurred nowhere near where U.S. or coalition forces were operating.\n\nKirby emphasized that U.S. trainers and advisers are close to danger but do not have a ground combat mission. He stated that they have the right to defend themselves and the responsibility to shoot back if they feel under threat.\n\nThe capture of Baghdadi, which remains under militant control, demonstrates ISIS's continued ability to launch offensive operations despite coalition airstrikes and talks of a counteroffensive on major cities held by the group. U.S. officials maintain that the militants are largely on the defensive.",
    " Title: Senate Confirms Eugene Scalia as U.S. Labor Secretary Along Party Lines\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate confirmed Eugene Scalia, son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, as the next Labor Secretary on Thursday afternoon by a vote of 53-44. The confirmation came after a brief stint as the acting secretary by Patrick Pizzella, who filled the position following the resignation of former Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta in July.\n\nAcosta's departure was prompted by backlash over his handling of the case of Jeffrey Epstein, a now-deceased accused child predator, when he was a federal prosecutor in 2008.\n\nEugene Scalia, who has a professional history representing Wall Street banks, Walmart, UPS, and SeaWorld, among others, has a long track record of fighting labor and financial regulations. This professional history has put him at odds with Senate Democrats.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) described Scalia's nomination as a \"slap in the face of the Labor Department,\" stating that President Trump \"could have chosen a union member\" instead.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, expressed disappointment with the vote and vowed to \"fight every day to hold him and the Trump administration accountable for the harm they're doing to workers.\"\n\nHealth Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), however, praised the confirmation. GOP Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.) called Scalia \"an expert in labor, employment, and regulatory law\" with \"an unmatched resume of experience in both the private and public sector.\"\n\n\"Eugene Scalia is well-qualified to lead the Department of Labor with a steady hand at a time when workers' wages are up and unemployment is near record lows,\" Alexander said in a statement. \"Now that Mr. Scalia has been confirmed, I look forward to his getting to work to help continue to grow our economy and help workers gain the skills they need to succeed in today's workplace.\"",
    " Title: New York Governor and President Trump Disagree on Authority to Lift Lockdown Orders\n\nArticle:\n\nA dispute has arisen between New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and President Donald Trump over who has the ultimate authority to lift coronavirus lockdown orders in the United States. The disagreement began when President Trump claimed he has \"total\" power to lift virus lockdowns, a statement that Governor Cuomo refuted on Tuesday.\n\nThe US is currently the epicenter of the pandemic, with 592,743 cases and 25,239 deaths. New York state, which has the most cases, has seen signs of improvement, with the number of people hospitalized due to coronavirus falling for the first time on Tuesday. However, the state still reported 778 deaths in the past 24 hours.\n\nOn Monday, President Trump stated on Twitter that deciding when to reopen states was \"the decision of the president,\" not state governors, although he added that he would make his decision \"in conjunction with governors.\" The US Constitution states that states maintain public order and safety, and it has been individual state governors who have issued lockdown or shelter-in-place orders.\n\nOn Monday, several US state governors discussed plans to resume economic activity without apparent input from the Trump administration. Ten states, led by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and California Governor Gavin Newsom, said they would coordinate how to reopen businesses after the outbreak is contained. All but one of the states are led by a Democratic governor.\n\nThe row escalated on Tuesday, with Governor Cuomo telling CBS that President Trump does not have total authority to decide when to reopen businesses, because \"we don't have a king, we have a president.\" During his daily press briefing, Governor Cuomo criticized President Trump, adding he would \"not engage\" in a fight with him, but would have \"no choice\" if the president threatened the welfare of New Yorkers.\n\nPresident Trump took the row to Twitter on Tuesday, criticizing Governor Cuomo and issuing an oblique snipe at other governors. The president aimed particular fire at Governor Cuomo, who he said was calling \"daily, even hourly, begging for everything,\" like hospitals, beds, and ventilators for his state.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump struck a less combative tone later on Tuesday, saying he would make a decision on the economy \"in conjunction with governors\" soon. The Trump administration had previously signaled 1 May as a potential date for easing the restrictions. However, the US's top infectious diseases adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told AP on Tuesday that the 1 May date might be \"a bit overly optimistic.\"\n\nGlobally, different approaches have been adopted to loosening lockdown restrictions. The Chinese province of Wuhan, where coronavirus was first reported last December, has partially reopened after more than two months of isolation. Spain has allowed around 300,000 nonessential workers to return to their jobs. Italy - the hardest-hit country in Europe - will allow a narrow range of businesses to resume operations this week. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has announced the country's near-lockdown will extend until 11 May. The UK government has said no one should expect any changes to its lockdown restrictions this week.",
    " Title: Romney's Debate Performance Boosts Confidence Among GOP Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nRecent events indicate a significant shift in the sentiment towards Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, as his performance in the debates has led to an increase in support and enthusiasm among Republican voters.\n\nIn the past, many GOP voters expressed displeasure with Romney, with some reluctantly endorsing him due to their disdain for President Obama. However, Romney's aggressive performance in the debates has instilled new confidence within the GOP, as his rise in the polls and the positive response from the first debate have increased enthusiasm among the grassroots.\n\nGary Bauer, a prominent social conservative, notes that Romney is attracting larger crowds, such as 12,000 in Cleveland and 8,000 in suburban Virginia, which would have been inconceivable for him just a few weeks ago. Political rallies typically grow in size as Election Day approaches, but Romney's big moment came during the direct debate with Obama.\n\nRomney's ability to hold his own against a president some Republican voters find \"absolutely disgusting\" has been emotionally fulfilling for partisans. David Carney, who served as a strategist for Texas Gov. Rick Perry's presidential campaign, notes that conservatives saw Romney as someone who \"wants this thing and he's going to fight for it.\"\n\nDuring the GOP primary season, the question of who would be most likely to take Obama to task during the fall debates was a hot topic. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and Romney's primary rival, stated in January that he was the candidate who could \"clearly defeat Obama in a series of debates.\"\n\nRomney struggled to win any state by a significant margin against Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who were considered second-tier challengers but also more reliably conservative. However, Romney's debate performances might have looked like the fulfillment of the worst fears conservatives had about him, as he pivoted to the center and softened his stances on issues such as health care and tax policy.\n\nDespite these concerns, die-hard Republicans have become willing to give Romney their firm support, with Henry Olsen, vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, stating, \"It doesn't have anything to do with moving to the center \u2014 it's, 'We can be behind a winner.'\" Olsen adds, \"For the first time in months, they really get the feeling their guy can win.\" This newfound support is also attributed to Romney's choice of Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate, as it signals that he will assemble a conservative team in his Cabinet and the Supreme Court.",
    " Title: U.S. Government Faces Potential Debt Crisis with $100 Trillion in Total Debt by 2048, According to CBO\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released its latest long-term budget projections, revealing a disconcerting trajectory for the federal fiscal health of the United States. The report projects a total government debt of $100 trillion by 2048, a figure that represents 152% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that year.\n\nThe CBO's projections depict a significant increase in spending, while taxes will only slightly increase, leading to deep annual deficits that accumulate into a potentially catastrophic debt burden. Debt held by the public, which is currently 78% of GDP, is expected to reach 152% in 2048. Given that GDP will be $65 trillion that year, it means a debt total of $98.8 trillion.\n\nThe CBO also projected that Social Security will become insolvent early in the 2030s. The government is projected to pay out a staggering $4 trillion a year in Social Security payments and nearly $4.5 trillion in Medicare benefits in 2048, accounting for about half of the deficit that year. Interest on the debt is also expected to rise, from about $300 billion this year, or less than 2% of GDP, to $4 trillion, or 6.3% of GDP, in three decades.\n\nGovernment spending is projected to consume nearly one-third of GDP in 2018, approaching the level of some European governments. Tax revenue, meanwhile, is projected to rise slowly and will still be below 20% of GDP in 2048. The CBO used current law to make its calculations, anticipating the GOP tax cuts to expire within a decade.\n\nShould Congress choose to extend the tax cuts and to continue heightened spending envisioned in the latest spending law, the situation gets even more bleak. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates debt could reach about 200% of GDP\u2014or about $130 trillion\u2014in 2048. As it is, debt at 152%\u2014the CBO's projection\u2014would be the highest in U.S. history, \"by far\" surpassing even the worst years of World War II, the government analysts said.\n\nPoliticians from both parties have expressed concern over the projected debt levels. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, stated, \"Today's report is another reminder about the true costs of handing out massive tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations.\" Republicans countered that taxes, while historically low now, will be above average by the end of the three-decade window. They argue that the problem isn't a lack of government money, but too much government payouts.\n\nThe CBO did not take sides, but did highlight the large projected growth in spending on entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare as major drivers of debt. The government will pay out a staggering $4 trillion a year in Social Security payments and nearly $4.5 trillion in Medicare benefits in 2048, the CBO said. This would account for about half of the deficit that year.",
    " Title: Justice Department Warns of Federal Intervention in State Lockdown Orders\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a memo issued on Monday, Attorney General William Barr stated that the Department of Justice (DOJ) will intervene if state and local stay-at-home orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic become overly restrictive, potentially violating constitutional rights. The memo comes as states begin to reopen their economies, with businesses such as hair salons and gyms reopening in Georgia, despite health experts' warnings of a potential resurgence of coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nBarr's memo highlights restrictions on religious liberty, discrimination against \"disfavored speech,\" and undue interference with the economy as violations of federal laws. The Justice Department will reportedly be monitoring state and local directives closely, with Eric Dreiband, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, and Matthew Schneider, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Michigan, leading the effort.\n\nThe memo follows thousands of protests against stay-at-home orders in multiple states, including Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. President Donald Trump has endorsed these protests, encouraging supporters to \"liberate\" states that have seen large gatherings of protesters.\n\nGovernors across the nation, particularly in states with stricter lockdown measures, such as Michigan, are finding themselves on a political tightrope due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the pressure from anti-quarantine protests and the president's endorsement. Michigan, which has been heavily impacted by the pandemic with about 38,000 COVID-19 cases and 3,400 deaths as of Monday, has imposed some of the most stringent restrictions. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has ordered residents to stay inside except for essential purposes and nonessential businesses to not require employees to work.\n\nBarr warned last week of potential Justice Department intervention, telling conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt that officials are reviewing stay-at-home restrictions. \"And if we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them. And if they \u2019re not and people bring lawsuits, we file a statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs,\" Barr said.",
    " Title: White House Considering Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Amid Economic Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is reportedly considering a temporary payroll tax cut to stimulate the economy and potentially avoid a slowdown or recession, according to a report by The Washington Post on Monday. The administration's top economic advisors have expressed growing concerns about a possible economic slowdown as the 2020 election nears, despite President Trump's positive assessments of the U.S. economy.\n\nHowever, a White House spokesperson denied that a payroll tax cut is currently under consideration. The Washington Post reported that discussions are still in their early stages, and officials have not decided whether to seek Congress' approval for the cut.\n\nMost working Americans pay a payroll tax on their earnings, a 6.2% levy that funds Social Security programs. The payroll tax was reduced to 4.2% during the Obama administration to encourage consumer spending during the Great Recession but was increased to 6.2% in 2013. A payroll tax cut would provide relief to many middle-class families that did not see such benefits under Trump's tax cuts.\n\nPayroll tax cuts can add to the deficit and potentially take billions from Social Security. The administration's discussions about a new payroll tax cut have only begun in the past few days, according to the report, and specific details about the design have not been finalized.\n\nThe talks follow a weekend blitz in which the president and his top economic advisers touted the economy and blamed Democrats for talking it down. \"Our Economy is very strong, despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed, but the Democrats are trying to \u2018will\u2019 the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election. Very Selfish!\" Trump tweeted on Monday.\n\nA survey by the National Association for Business Economics, to be released on Monday, shows that 34% of economists believe a slowing economy will tip into a recession in 2021, up from 25% in a survey taken in February. Only 2% of those polled expect a recession to begin this year, while 38% predict it will occur in 2020.\n\nTrump has dismissed concerns about a recession, offering an optimistic outlook for the economy after last week's steep drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. A strong economy is crucial to the Republican president's 2020 reelection prospects.\n\nThe economists have previously expressed concern that Trump's tariffs and higher budget deficits could eventually dampen the economy. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on goods from many key U.S. trading partners, including China, Europe, Mexico, and Canada. Officials maintain that the tariffs, which are taxes on imports, will help the administration gain more favorable terms of trade. However, U.S. trading partners have retaliated with tariffs of their own.",

The image of McConnell sitting with his parents in rural Alabama during that time has been provided by the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville.\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic unfolds, McConnell recalls the fear and uncertainty he felt during the polio crisis, drawing parallels between the two crises. He was diagnosed with polio in 1944, and his left leg was paralyzed. After two years of treatment at a polio center in Warm Springs, Georgia, his mother was told that he would be able to walk without a leg brace.\n\nSeventy years later, McConnell walked into the U.S. Senate to pass a sweeping coronavirus rescue package and shutter the chamber for the foreseeable future. He stated, \"There's hope that we're going to get on top of this disease within a year, year and a half.\"\n\nStacey D. Stewart, president & CEO of March of Dimes, which started as FDR's National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, described polio as a \"scary virus\" that particularly struck children, causing swift closures of schools, playgrounds, and swimming pools. Thousands died, others were hospitalized, and some were left permanently paralyzed or with post-polio syndrome.\n\nMcConnell was taught to stay off his feet during his recovery, and his mother would run through physical therapy with him \"like a drill sergeant.\" He remembers the embarrassment of having a narrower left leg circumference when putting on a swimsuit and difficulty climbing stairs.\n\nMcConnell does not remember much from those earliest days, but he does remember the arrival of the polio vaccine and the relief it brought. As Congress considers the next aid package, he expressed a desire for more funding for healthcare.\n\nMcConnell returned to Warm Springs last year, reviewing files about his condition and treatments. He was unsure about how his mother afforded his medical care during that time. One memory that stands clear is the relief the country felt when the polio vaccine was discovered.",
    " Title: EPA Chief Pruitt Under Fire for Alleged Unauthorized Staff Pay Raises and Potential Conflict of Interest\n\nArticle:\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chief Scott Pruitt came under renewed scrutiny this week following a report by The Atlantic that he had granted unauthorized pay raises to two of his aides, including one who assisted him in finding housing in Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to the report, Pruitt requested that the salary of Sarah Greenwalt, his deputy chief of staff, be increased from $107,435 to $164,200, and that of Millan Hupp, his spokesperson, be raised from $86,460 to $114,590. As political appointees, these salary increases required approval from the White House. However, the White House reportedly rejected the request.\n\nIn response, Pruitt's team allegedly studied the particulars of the Safe Drinking Water provision, learning that by reappointing Greenwalt and Hupp under this authority, Pruitt could exercise total control over their contracts and grant the raises on his own. Pruitt reportedly ordered the raises, with Greenwalt receiving a raise of $28,130 and Hupp a raise of $56,765, compared to their 2017 salaries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pruitt appeared on Fox News, where he was questioned about the pay raises. In the interview, Pruitt claimed that he was not aware of the pay raises and that his staff had acted without his knowledge. However, when pressed about accountability, Pruitt stated that there would be some accountability, but did not specify whether the individuals responsible were career or political staff members.\n\nIn a separate development, it was also reported that before Pruitt rented a room from a top DC energy lobbyist, the lobbyist and his wife had funded Pruitt's political campaigns in his home state of Oklahoma. Campaign finance records show that Steven and Vicki Hart, who last year rented Pruitt a room in their Capitol Hill home for $50 per night, began donating to Pruitt's campaigns for Oklahoma attorney general in 2010. Steven Hart even hosted a fundraiser for Pruitt's reelection effort.\n\nPruitt's actions have sparked criticism and calls for accountability, with some questioning whether he has been dishonest about his knowledge of the pay raises and the potential conflict of interest presented by his relationship with the Hart couple. The EPA and the White House have not yet responded to requests for comment.",
    " Title: White House Announces National Garden of American Heroes with Statues of Prominent Figures\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has unveiled an executive order to create a \"National Garden of American Heroes,\" which will feature statues of prominent Americans. The order, announced during a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, comes amidst calls to remove Confederate statues across the country and address other racist iconography.\n\nThe executive order, which President Donald Trump announced, establishes the Task Force for Building and Rebuilding Monuments to American Heroes. This task force will use funding from the Interior Department to establish the site and has 60 days to submit a report to the White House detailing options for the creation of the National Garden, including potential locations.\n\nThe garden will include statues of John Adams, Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King Jr., Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan, Jackie Robinson, and Harriet Tubman, among others. The garden will also maintain a collection of statues for temporary display at appropriate sites around the United States.\n\nThe garden is expected to be open prior to July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence. The executive order also addresses current calls to topple Confederate statues, stating that destroying monuments is a desecration of the nation's shared heritage.\n\nPresident Trump, in an impassioned speech at Mount Rushmore, criticized those tearing down statues of Confederate leaders, accusing them of wanting to \"overthrow the American Revolution\" and fundamentally change the country. He also warned against a \"new far-left fascism\" that seeks to \"tear down every statue, symbol and memory of our national heritage.\"",

In a press conference, Van Drew explained that the party's push towards far-left policies and personal threats drove him to become a Republican.\n\nVan Drew, who has been a Democrat for many years, recounted a meeting with a local county chairman two weeks ago, who allegedly threatened him with political retaliation if he did not vote to impeach President Trump. This incident, according to Van Drew, prompted him to reconsider his political allegiance.\n\nVan Drew stated that he had previously considered switching parties during his tenure in the New Jersey state Senate, when he voted on two bills promoting faith and patriotism. These bills, he said, were met with criticism from far-left Democrats who were \"disgusted\" with his support.\n\nThe congressman emphasized his belief in American exceptionalism, capitalism, and the importance of opportunity for all. He also criticized the \"extreme\" members of the Democratic party who, in his view, denigrate the United States and oppose bipartisan efforts.\n\nVan Drew took direct aim at Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and the Green New Deal, stating that he believes the proposal should never be considered. He also mentioned his support for lowering taxes, balancing the budget, and honoring first responders and veterans.\n\nVan Drew added that the Democrats are becoming less tolerant of diverse thought as they become more extreme, and he cited former Republican President Ronald Reagan as one of his favorite presidents. Reagan's comment about the Democratic party leaving him also resonated with Van Drew.\n\nThe exact details of the threats made against Van Drew and the identity of the county chairman remain unavailable. The Democratic National Committee and Van Drew's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
    " Title: Hispanic Republican Leaders Unite Against Donald Trump's Presidential Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the growing threat of Donald Trump capturing the Republican Party's presidential nomination, Hispanic Republican leaders have taken a unified stand against the billionaire. On the eve of the third GOP debate, about two dozen Hispanic leaders emerged from a closed-door meeting in Colorado with a warning for the Republican Party: they risk losing the Hispanic vote and the White House if Mr. Trump is nominated.\n\nAlfonso Aguilar, director of American Principles Project's Latino Partnership and former official in the administration of President George W. Bush, stated, \"Our message to Trump is, 'You're done.' We think if you are the candidate, Republicans will lose the White House.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign declined to comment on the meeting. The Hispanic leaders plan to monitor the rest of the GOP field over the coming weeks and months, and could decide to write off others based on their immigration views.\n\nThe GOP presidential debate is set to take place at 8 p.m. Wednesday at the Coors Events Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Hosted by CNBC, the prime-time showdown is limited to 10 participants based on national polls and follows a 6 p.m. undercard event featuring four of the lower-tier candidates.\n\nTrump has downplayed the idea that he has fallen out of favor with Hispanics, though an AP-GFK poll this week showed 72 percent of Latinos view him unfavorably, compared to 11 percent who see him in a positive light. Given Colorado's deep pool of Hispanic voters, Wednesday's debate could focus more on immigration, which polls show is a threshold issue for many Hispanics who won't even look at a candidate that comes out against robust legalization.\n\nRosario Marin, former treasurer of the United States under President George W. Bush, who attended the meeting, said, \"Foolishly, some candidates think they don't need the Hispanic vote in the primary, so they pander to the voters with extreme views instead of just showing us who they are. Heed our warning: 'Don't expect us to come to your side during the general election. If you are not with us now, we will not be with you then.'\"\n\nThe Hispanic \"summit\" Tuesday was billed as the first of its kind, and attendees said they've scheduled another meeting a day before the Dec. 15 debate in Nevada, which is also home to many Latino voters. The group also vowed to highlight how President Obama broke his promise to push an immigration fight during his first year in office and how Hillary Rodham Clinton, the likely 2016 Democratic nominee, said last year that illegal immigrant children surging across the U.S.-Mexico border should be sent home.\n\nRepublicans have wrestled over the issue of immigration since Mitt Romney lost Latino voters by a 71 percent-to-27 percent margin in the 2012 election after he pledged to rely on \"self-deportation\" to reduce the number of illegal immigrants living in the United States. The pledge contrasted with the executive amnesty that President Obama granted to young illegal immigrants, known as Dreamers, roughly six months out from the general election.\n\nPresident Obama won the Latino vote by an even wider margin\u201475 percent to 23 percent\u2014in Colorado, which has produced Republicans with diverse opinions on the issue, including former Rep. Tom Tancredo, a staunch \"amnesty\" opponent, and Sen. Cory Gardner, who supports a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants and expanding guest worker programs.\n\nThis year, the issue has divided the GOP field, with former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, both Florida Republicans, Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich being among the candidates that have backed some sort of a path to legal status for illegal immigrants. Others, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, have vowed to oppose \"amnesty\" and have supported expanding legal immigration.\n\nMr. Trump, meanwhile, has focused on the enforcement side of the debate and signaled he is open to reducing legal immigration. In August, he rolled out a six-page plan that called for more border fencing, deporting all illegal immigrants, and ending the policy granting automatic citizenship to almost everyone born in the U.S., including to illegal immigrant mothers.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican, applauded the Trump plan, saying at the time that it \"re-establishes the principle that America's immigration laws should serve the interest of its own citizens.\" For the Hispanic leaders that gathered in Boulder Tuesday, the proposal was yet another troubling sign for Mr. Trump, who had caught their attention over the summer when he said that Mexico officials were sending drug smugglers, \"rapists and some, I assume good people\" into the United States.\n\nMr. Trump has pledged to support whoever wins the GOP nomination. Hispanic leaders, however, said they won't support Mr. Trump. \"We still have hope that we can help elect a Republican candidate,\" said Massey Villarreal, former head of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, before the meeting. \"We are 100 percent united behind the fact that Mr. Trump is not our guy.\"\n\n\"We are not going to shy away from the fact that if Mr. Trump is the nominee, we will encourage Latinos to write their own candidate in,\" he said. Mr. Aguilar said he would \"leave the ballot blank,\" and also said that it would be \"naive\" to suggest that Mr. Trump is the only GOP candidate who could jeopardize the party's chances of winning over more Hispanics.\n\n\"Trump is in a league of his own, but there is a concern about the way Cruz has been handling the issue,\" he said. Mr. Aguilar said Mr. Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant father, has sent the wrong message by cozying up to Mr. Trump, while also coming out against birthright citizenship and refusing to spell out his plans for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the country. Others said they are willing to cut Mr. Cruz some more slack. The Cruz camp did not respond to an email seeking comment.",
    " Title: High School Students' Views on Free Speech and Offensive Content: A Mixed Bag, According to a Knight Foundation Survey\n\nArticle:\n\nA book titled \"End of Discussion,\" co-authored by Mary Katharine Ham and Guy Benson in 2015, expresses concern over the increasing hostility towards free speech and open debate among Americans, particularly younger generations. The authors argue that the Left often labels ideas they oppose as hateful and offensive, aiming to prevent debates by branding them as morally unworthy of consideration.\n\nRecently, a survey conducted by the Knight Foundation on American high school students sheds light on their views regarding free speech and offensive content. The survey results are somewhat ambiguous, as they rely on the interpretation of terms such as \"bullying\" and \"offensive.\"\n\nOne positive data point from the poll is that 91% of students believe that unpopular speech is a protected right. This percentage has risen by eight points since the survey's 2004 installment, indicating a promising trend. However, only 64% of students believe that free speech is more important than protecting someone from being offended, which is a majority but not a two-thirds majority.\n\nThe survey also reveals that students are less disposed than ever to believe that the First Amendment's safeguards of fundamental rights are too excessive. This is reassuring, but the results also show that smaller majorities of high schoolers of color (Asians, Hispanics, and especially blacks) believe that the value of upholding free speech trumps the value of insulating someone from taking offense.\n\nOne of the more concerning tactics, according to the authors, is the conflation of offensive speech with physical violence, rooted in a broad definition of what constitutes \"safety.\" The survey's findings suggest that this trick may successfully and lastingly manipulate younger generations, potentially determining whether free speech and expression remain core American values.\n\nDavid Burge, also known as @iowahawkblog on Twitter, offers a simple but incisive insight that should give anyone inclined toward the \"let's ban offensive or bullying speech\" position serious pause: \"Doucheous @benshapiro tell you what: I'll let you ban hate speech when you let me define hate speech.\" This point underscores the importance of maintaining a clear and consistent definition of free speech, as well as the potential dangers of allowing it to be defined by those with extreme or biased views.\n\nIn conclusion, the survey results offer a mixed bag, with some encouraging signs and red flags. The uniting solution, as suggested by the authors, is to link arms and keep free speech as free as possible, with the exceptions to that rule (excluding hate speech) as narrow as possible, to preserve the principle and everyone's right to open expression. The survey's findings underscore the importance of educators conveying the truth about free speech and passing the American torch to the next generation.",
    " Title: House Republicans Propose Spending Measure to Avert Government Shutdown, Ease Budget Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublicans controlling the U.S. House of Representatives have moved to pass a spending measure on Monday, aiming to provide additional funding for military readiness while alleviating the impact of across-the-board spending cuts that are currently taking effect. This measure, which would fund federal operations through September, aims to prevent a potential government shutdown later this month.\n\nThe proposed legislation would maintain the detailed 2013 budgets for the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments, while other agencies would be frozen at 2012 levels and subject to the 5 percent domestic agency and 7.8 percent Pentagon cuts ordered by President Barack Obama on Friday.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have warned that these cuts, known as sequestration, are draconian and could slow economic growth and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that they would slow the economy by 0.6 percent and cost about 750,000 jobs.\n\nThe impact of the new cuts has been slow to reach the broader public. The Pentagon has announced plans to furlough thousands of military school teachers worldwide and close stores with consumer goods an extra day each week. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has reported delays in customs lines at airports, including Los Angeles International and O'Hare International in Chicago.\n\nPresident Obama has stated that he is continuing to seek out Republican partners to reach a deal to ease or head off the cuts, but no breakthrough has been reported. \"We are going to manage it the best we can to minimize the impact on American families,\" Obama said at the start of the first Cabinet meeting of his second term. \"It is not the right way to go about deficit reduction.\"\n\nThe new Republican funding measure is set to advance through the House on Wednesday. It would provide an increase for military operations and maintenance efforts, as well as veterans' health programs, while putting most of the rest of the government on budget autopilot. After accounting for the across-the-board cuts, domestic agencies would face reductions exceeding 5 percent when compared with last year.\n\nThe legislation would provide about $2 billion more than the current level to increase security at U.S. embassies and diplomatic missions worldwide. Last September, a terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nThe across-the-board cuts would carve $85 billion in spending from the government's $3.6 trillion budget for this year, focusing the cuts on the approximately $1 trillion allocated to the day-to-day agency operating budgets set by Congress each year. These so-called discretionary accounts received big boosts in the first two years of Obama's presidency when Democrats controlled Congress, but have borne the brunt of the cuts approved as Obama and Republicans have grappled over the budget.\n\nThe FBI and the Border Patrol would be able to maintain current staffing levels and would not have to furlough employees under the proposed legislation. The measure would also provide new funding for embassy security and modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal.",
    " Title: White House Celebrates January Job Growth, Cites President Trump's Economic Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House announced on Friday the first jobs report of the new administration, which showed the U.S. economy added 227,000 jobs in January. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer attributed the job growth to the consumer confidence inspired by President Trump's presidency.\n\nAccording to Spicer, recent polls indicate stronger consumer confidence. He declined to attribute specific job gains to President Trump or his predecessor, former President Obama, as the report covers the transition month. However, Spicer asserted that President Trump's economic effects began before he took office.\n\n\"President Trump campaigned on making America work again. Even before he took office, the markets knew he would deliver on that promise,\" Spicer said.\n\nIn contrast to Trump's campaign criticism of the Labor Department's employment level calculations, Spicer did not reiterate such claims in this context.\n\nThe strong hiring surpassed expectations, while the jobless rate rose from 4.7 percent to 4.8 percent, as 76,000 more workers entered the workforce to seek employment. The Labor Department reported that employers in the retail, construction, and financial sectors hired the most workers. The government also revised its estimate down for job creation in November and December, lowering the total number of jobs created in that period by 39,000.\n\nWage growth remains a concern, with average hourly earnings up 3 cents to $26 in January, compared with December's 6-cent increase. For the year ended Jan. 31, wages increased 2.5 percent.\n\n\"The president's already taken significant steps to turn our economy around, and he is looking forward to ensuring that every American who wants a job has the opportunity to find one,\" Spicer said. \"While the president's definitely pleased that the job growth has far surpassed expectations and that the labor force participation is rising, he also recognizes that there is a lot more work to be done.\"\n\nSpicer described the president's jobs agenda as \"big and bold.\" The specifics of this agenda were not detailed in the provided text.",
    " Title: GOP Struggles in 2018 Elections Despite Economic Boom: A Divided Party and the Rise of Democratic Socialism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party, despite holding all the reins of power and the U.S. economy reaching a 17-year low in unemployment (the U6 figure), is facing challenges in the 2018 special elections and the upcoming midterms. This unexpected struggle can be attributed to the party's internal divisions, a phenomenon that has intensified since President Donald Trump's election.\n\nThe American political system, characterized by a binary choice between two major parties, has created a tentpole party in the Republican Party. Unlike the Democratic Party, which has fewer differences among its members, the GOP is composed of various factions, including Libertarians, conservative internationalists, and conservative-nationalists, among others. Each faction believes their version of conservatism is the purest, leading to infighting and opposition to party consolidation.\n\nTrump's election has further exacerbated these divisions. Depending on whom one asks, Trump is either a savior figure or a Svengali-type villain. This internal discord, combined with Trump's absence from the ballot, has led to a less clear reason for voters to support the GOP. The divisions within the party are suppressing the vote at a time when the Left is galvanized, and this is particularly true for those Republicans who did not secure Trump's endorsement.\n\nAnother challenge for the GOP is the disinclination of \"Reagan Democrats\" \u2013 voters who supported Trump in 2016 \u2013 to vote for traditional Republican candidates. These voters are unlikely to support candidates who favor free trade, open borders, and are perceived as the party of entrenched wealth.\n\nMoreover, the issue of morality plays a significant role. Conventional Republicans often argue that social issues should be downplayed in tight elections to avoid damaging candidates with weaker stances on these issues. However, the Democrats are surging forward with their own take on the culture war, which appeals to younger voters.\n\nThe generational divide is crucial in understanding the GOP's difficulties in winning elections without Trump. In 2020, the largest cohort of Baby Boomers is set to retire and begin drawing on Welfare programs en masse, potentially creating economic distortions. Meanwhile, the radicalism exhibited by the Left will likely intensify and gain traction, while the Right will continue to lose influence and legitimacy as it bickers among its various factions and ignores the blue-collar voters who propelled Trump to victory.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the GOP needs to more fully embrace Trumpism, stand firm on trade and immigration issues, and unflinchingly wage the culture war. A coalition of blue-collar workers and social conservatives is waiting to be embraced by the wider GOP. As Reagan said, the Republicans need to be \"raising a banner of bold colors, no pale pastels.\" So far, without Trump, the GOP is all pastel.",
    " Title: FBI Re-opens Investigation into Hillary Clinton's Email Server Ahead of Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has announced the reopening of its investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's personal email server. The decision, made public on Friday afternoon, was based on the discovery of emails during an \"unrelated investigation\" that are deemed to be pertinent to Clinton's case. The FBI is currently determining whether these emails contain classified information.\n\nIn layman's terms, this development places Clinton under renewed legal scrutiny. The FBI does not typically investigate and recommend enforcement actions against computer servers; rather, it holds individuals accountable, and Clinton is the primary individual associated with her email server.\n\nThe newly discovered emails are likely problematic, as the FBI would not publicly reopen an investigation on the eve of a presidential election if the emails contained information about non-sensitive topics. The FBI's actions suggest that the content of the emails is causing concern within the Bureau, indicating a serious nature to the new evidence.\n\nThe emails could potentially impact the decision regarding whether to charge Clinton or her aides under the Espionage Act or for obstructing the initial investigation. The FBI's previous decision not to prosecute Clinton under a controversial legal standard may now be called into question if there are more emails and if Clinton or her aides attempted to conceal their existence from the FBI.\n\nThe FBI's investigation and its potential outcome could significantly impact Clinton's closing argument to the American people, as the election is less than two weeks away. If the FBI does not clear Clinton before the election, her campaign message may focus on the perceived danger posed by her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, despite her being under criminal investigation.\n\nIt remains to be seen if any Democrats will call for Clinton to step aside from the presidential race. In the past, a number of Republicans asked Trump to withdraw from the race following the release of tapes showing him making comments that could be construed as admitting to sexual battery. Now, the tables have turned, and the Democratic candidate is under criminal investigation. Millions of people have already cast their votes, believing Clinton had been \"cleared.\" The question remains whether Clinton's personal ambition justifies the potential national pain this development may cause.",
    " Title: FBI Whistleblower Sibel Edmonds Accuses Robert Mueller of Deep State Involvement and Conflicts of Interest\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on The Alex Jones Show, FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds accused Special Counsel Robert Mueller of being a deep state operative and a key figure in the investigation into supposed ties between President Trump and Russia. Edmonds, who has a history with Mueller, alleged that he had covered up Islamic terror networks in the past and is now conducting a \"new McCarthyism\" in the Trump-Russia probe.\n\nEdmonds, who claims Mueller helped suppress evidence and issue gag orders in her case, stated, \"Imagine my shock when I saw that Robert Mueller was appointed as the special counsel in this case, the same Robert Mueller, who in my case, put gag orders together with attorney general Ashcroft.\"\n\nEdmonds further alleged that FBI agents in Washington, Chicago, and Patterson field offices had blown the whistle on Mueller for suppressing investigations into terror networks. She also revealed that Mueller had invoked the state secrets privilege and placed gag orders to protect a terrorist network.\n\nEdmonds expressed her shock that Mueller would be brought on as an \"impartial\" prosecutor in the Trump-Russia probe, given his history of corruption. She also noted that it is a slam dunk case that Robert Mueller cannot preside as the special counsel in the Russia probe.\n\nIn another segment of the show, Edmonds stated that there are agents within the FBI who would testify that Mueller is not an impartial special counselor. This, she argued, would give President Trump all he needs to fire Mueller before he can ruin any more lives in his \"endless new McCarthyism-like witch hunt.\"\n\nIn a video on her own website, Edmonds discussed Robert Mueller's conflicts of interest in going after decorated General Michael Flynn. She stated, \"FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds exposes Special Counsel Robert Mueller's conflict of interest in pursuing General Michael Flynn's case due to his direct involvement as former FBI Director and his role in covering up and protecting Gulen Networks' criminal operations within the United States, and demands that he steps down.\"\n\nAt this point, it is clear that Robert Mueller is part of a deep state-run, mainstream media-pushed operation to take out the rightfully elected president. Regardless of one's political stance, this is a direct attack on American democracy.",

Fiorina, who served as a surrogate in John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and ran for the U.S. Senate from California in 2010, is the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company.\n\nHere are five lesser-known facts about Fiorina:\n\n1. Fiorina obtained her undergraduate degree in medieval history and philosophy from Stanford University. Her father, a federal appeals court judge, suggested she pursue a law degree after graduation. Although she attended law school, Fiorina dropped out after a semester due to daily migraines. However, she holds graduate business degrees from the University of Maryland and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\n2. Fiorina's early career included temporary work with the agency Kelly Services, where she was part of the team of secretaries known as \"Kelly girls.\" She also held secretarial positions while attending college, including working for Hewlett-Packard, the tech company she would later lead.\n\n3. In 2009, Fiorina was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. At campaign appearances, women often approach her to share their own experiences as cancer survivors. \"It's a sisterhood,\" she says.\n\n4. Fiorina's husband, Frank Fiorina, started his career driving a tow truck for a family-owned body shop. He eventually became an executive at AT&T.\n\n5. In 2010, while running for the U.S. Senate, Fiorina ran one of the most famous campaign ads ever.

    " Title: Senate Fails to Pass Healthcare Reform Bill: Analysis of the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate failed to pass the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, a Republican-proposed healthcare reform bill, last week. The bill, which aimed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), was not supported by enough votes, with no votes counted in its favor.\n\nThe failure of the bill, which occurred with a Republican president, a Republican majority in both houses of Congress, and a Republican-dominated Supreme Court, has been described as especially bitter. The lack of public support for the bill, with only 12 percent of the public in favor, is one reason for its failure.\n\nThe Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, despite its 172 pages, offers little in the way of substantial reform of the healthcare system, which has been exacerbated by Obamacare but not caused by it. The bill tweaks the system without ambition for a turnaround.\n\nThe bill allows all Americans to purchase simple, low-deductible, high-premium catastrophic plans, repeals the individual and employer mandates, block-grants some Medicaid funding to states, and caps per-person spending within the program. It also allows individuals to use medical savings accounts to pay for premiums.\n\nHowever, the bill continues to force plans to cover medical options deemed essential by politicians but neither wanted nor needed by consumers. The Senate replaces Obama's subsidies with their tax credits. In reforming Medicaid over a period of years, the bill provides much wiggle room to allow those reforms to not occur. The Senate bill also allocates tens of billions of dollars to bribe health insurance companies to continue to offer plans in unprofitable state markets.\n\nThe bill spends money equal to or exceeding the budgets of some state governments to reverse the exodus of insurers from certain markets. The bill reads, \"There are authorized to be appropriated, and are appropriated, out of monies in the Treasury not otherwise obligated, $15,000,000,000 for each of calendar years 2018 and 2019, and $10,000,000,000 for each of calendar years 2020 and 2021, to the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (in this subsection and subsection (i) referred to as the \"Administrator\") to fund arrangements with health insurance issuers to assist in the purchase of health benefits coverage by addressing coverage and access disruption and responding to urgent health care needs within States.\"\n\nThe section appears more concerned with covering up the intrinsic problems with Obamacare than with overhauling the healthcare system to restore its health. The bill's approach to healthcare reform has been met with criticism and apathy, with even policy wonks appearing bored by what the Senate offered.\n\nThe challenge facing Congressional Republicans is to reform healthcare in such a way that provides universal access but relies on market principles rather than a handout mindset. A second challenge, which also may strike some as a contradiction, involves simultaneously controlling costs with a plan that encourages universal access. In the coming weeks, this page will offer some ideas on how to achieve this.",
    " Title: New Jersey Passes Law Allowing Unauthorized Immigrants to Obtain Driver's Licenses\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey has become the latest state to allow unauthorized immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, joining 14 other states and territories. The legislation, passed by the New Jersey Legislature on Monday night, is expected to be signed by Governor Phil Murphy, a Democrat. The bill, if signed, will go into effect in January 2021.\n\nThe new law creates two types of driver's licenses: a federally compliant Real ID license for air travel and a standard driver's license for driving and identification purposes. Unauthorized immigrants can apply for the standard license using foreign passports or driver's licenses instead of a Social Security number.\n\nCurrently, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Washington, Illinois, Vermont, Maryland, Delaware, Hawaii, Oregon, and New York, as well as Puerto Rico and Washington D.C., already offer driver's licenses to unauthorized immigrants. According to 2017 estimates, roughly 5.3 million unauthorized immigrants nationwide would be eligible to get a driver's license in these states.\n\nImmigrant advocates are lobbying other states, including Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Texas, and Massachusetts, to pass similar laws.\n\nResearch suggests that making driver's licenses available to unauthorized immigrants improves safety. Obtaining a license requires testing and training on road safety, as well as proof that an applicant can get auto insurance. Drivers with licenses are also more willing to cooperate with law enforcement, reducing burdens on police forces.\n\nA 2016 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal found that after California implemented its driver's license law in 2015, hit-and-runs dropped between 7 percent and 10 percent on average, amounting to roughly 4,000 fewer such accidents annually.\n\nSuch policies also have financial benefits, both for local governments and for drivers. The Fiscal Policy Institute found in 2017 that state and county governments could collect about $57 million in annual revenue, as well as $26 million in one-time revenues, by issuing 150,000 driver's licenses to unauthorized immigrants in New York City. The researchers also determined that it would likely lower auto insurance premiums overall.\n\nAn analysis conducted by New York City also found that having a driver's license provides additional financial stability for families and increases employment opportunities for unauthorized immigrants. Having a car allows them to look for jobs and housing that are not located near public transportation.\n\nHowever, even unauthorized immigrants with driver's licenses might still be at risk for deportation. A lawsuit filed in January claimed that the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles had unlawfully targeted unauthorized immigrants by sending their names, photos, car registrations, and other personal information to ICE.\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed back against efforts to prevent ICE from accessing DMV data. As New York's driver's license law went into effect on Monday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that those records allow it to investigate crimes such as human trafficking by \"building criminal cases, identifying criminal suspects, and enhancing officer safety.\"",
    " Title: Giuliani's Disappearance from Public Eye Linked to Potential Legal Peril\n\nArticle:\n\nRudy Giuliani, once a regular presence on cable news channels and Sunday talk shows, has largely vanished from the public eye following the arrest of two of his associates on campaign finance charges this month. The former New York City mayor's sudden reticence may be due to concerns about his own potential legal peril, as his dealings reportedly come under scrutiny by federal investigators.\n\nThe most recent activities of Giuliani that may be of interest to investigators are tied to Ukraine and his connections to associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were indicted on charges including conspiracy, false statements, and campaign finance violations. The indictment alleges an alleged scheme by Parnas and Fruman to remove the then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, from her post, a goal that was reportedly pursued at the behest of a Ukrainian official.\n\nWhile nothing in the indictment implicates Giuliani, he too was pushing for Yovanovitch's dismissal. House investigators have reviewed material filed by an anonymous State Department whistleblower that alleges \"propaganda\" about Yovanovitch that was sent to the State Department by Giuliani. However, it is unclear whether Giuliani's efforts were linked to those of Parnas and Fruman or whether Giuliani was even aware of them.\n\nFormer Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, who was approached by Parnas and Fruman as part of their alleged scheme, is complying with a grand jury subpoena for documents about what he knows about the matter. This suggests that prosecutors working for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York believe there could be much more to learn, according to legal experts.\n\nGiuliani enlisted Parnas and Fruman's help to dig up dirt in Ukraine on the family of former Vice President Joe Biden and conspiracy theories tied to the 2016 election. Parnas has told NPR that he helped translate and arrange interviews for Giuliani with former Ukrainian officials.\n\nParnas' company, Fraud Guarantee, paid Giuliani $500,000 to consult on technology and provide legal advice, Giuliani has said. All of these activities are of potential interest to investigators.\n\nWith an indictment hanging over Parnas and Fruman, former prosecutors say those two are under pressure to cooperate and spill whatever they may know about Giuliani, including their conversations with him and any directions he might have given them.\n\nApart from Ukraine, questions have also been raised about other Giuliani activities that, from the outside, look like foreign lobbying, experts say. Foreign lobbying is regulated by the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which requires individuals who are doing political or public relations work on behalf of a foreign entity to disclose that fact to the Justice Department.\n\nIn Giuliani's case, questions have been raised about positions he has advocated on issues related to Turkey that align with Ankara's interests. Giuliani reportedly pushed President Trump to extradite a Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in exile in Pennsylvania. The Turkish government has been pressuring the U.S. to hand over Gulen, whom Ankara blames for the failed 2016 coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nGiuliani also reportedly used an Oval Office meeting with Trump to argue for a prisoner swap with Turkey. The swap would have involved sending back to Turkey a Turkish-Iranian gold trader named Reza Zarrab, who was indicted in New York.\n\nZarrab, who had ties to Erdogan, ultimately pleaded guilty, cooperated with prosecutors, and provided testimony implicating the Turkish president in a massive corruption scheme.\n\nGiuliani's ties to an Iranian dissident group known as the MEK have also raised eyebrows. The group was listed by the State Department as a foreign terrorist organization before being removed from the list in 2012. Politics The Evolution Of Rudy Giuliani Listen \u00b7 6:13 6:13\n\nFor years, Giuliani has made speeches on the group's behalf and has been paid for his efforts. Giuliani told NPR that the Justice Department has never contacted him about his activities and whether they fall under the rubric of foreign lobbying. However, FARA experts say that's an incorrect reading of the law.\n\n\"That itself is a fundamental misunderstanding of what FARA requires,\" said attorney Joshua Ian Rosenstein, who specializes in advocacy law. \"Making speeches on behalf of a foreign political party within the United States where those speeches are aimed at influencing the views of the U.S. public or the U.S. media, with reference to the national or political interests of that party, falls squarely within the ambit of regulated conduct under FARA.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has put a recent emphasis on FARA enforcement, particularly in the wake of the Russia investigation. One high-profile setback came in September when former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig was found not guilty of making false statements to the Justice Department about work he did for the Ukrainian government.",
    " Title: Protesters Demand Justice for Jerame Reid, Killed by Police in Bridgeton, New Jersey\n\nArticle:\n\nProtesters across the country are rallying against racial disparities in police use of force following the shooting of Jerame Reid, a 36-year-old black man, by two Bridgeton, New Jersey, police officers. The incident was captured on a dashboard camera.\n\nThe video shows the officers pulling over a car in which Reid was a passenger. One of the officers, Braheme Days, who is black, and the other, Roger Worley, who is white, approached the vehicle. The officers pulled out their guns after Days stated he saw a gun in the glove compartment. The situation escalated, with Days shouting, \"Don't you fucking move,\" \"I'm going to shoot you,\" \"You're going to be fucking dead,\" and \"Show me your fucking hands!\" Days also appeared to remove a silver handgun from the car.\n\nReid disobeyed the orders not to move, telling the officers he was getting out of the car. When Reid stepped out of the vehicle with his hands at shoulder level, both officers fired, killing him. Both officers have been placed on administrative leave while prosecutors investigate the shooting.\n\nReid had spent about 13 years in prison for shooting at three state troopers when he was a teenager, according to the Associated Press. Days, the black officer involved in the traffic stop, was also among the arresting officers when Reid was charged for drug possession and other crimes in 2014. Between 2012 and 2014, Worley was involved in 23 uses of force, and Days in 11, according to records obtained by the Associated Press.\n\nThe Associated Press also found that Days and Worley were the subjects of multiple complaints alleging abuses of power over the past two years, but all the complaints were dismissed. Reid's death comes amid ongoing protests over racial disparities in the criminal justice system and police use of force.\n\nPolice are disproportionately likely to kill black Americans, according to limited FBI data. These racial disparities remain even in situations where the shooting victim was not attacking anyone else; some of these victims were instead killed while fleeing, committing a felony, or resisting arrest.\n\nThere were several high-profile police shootings in 2014 involving black men and boys, including the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the killing of 22-year-old John Crawford and 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Ohio, and the killing of 22-year-old Darrien Hunt in Utah. In these cases, police officers appeared to overestimate the threats posed by their victims, which may be a result of subconscious racial biases. Studies show officers are quicker to shoot black suspects in video game simulations.",
    " Title: Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki Resists Pressure to Step Down, Deploys Loyal Forces in Baghdad\n\nArticle:\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is holding onto power amidst mounting pressure to step down, following a series of confrontational actions on Monday. Maliki, whose party narrowly won parliamentary elections in April, has accused Iraq's ethnic Kurdish president of constitutional violations for failing to appoint a new prime minister. The formation of a new government has stalled, causing concern from US officials and sparking domestic unrest.\n\nOn Sunday, Shiite militias and security forces personally loyal to Maliki were reportedly positioned around the capital, Baghdad. This move is seen as a clear indication that Maliki has no intention of yielding to domestic or international pressure to step down. The US and other foreign powers have emphasized the importance of a new unity government in addressing sectarian tensions and combatting the self-declared Islamic State and its allies.\n\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry stated on Monday that a new government is crucial for maintaining stability in Iraq. \"The government formation process is critical in terms of sustaining stability and claim in Iraq,\" Kerry told reporters, according to Reuters. \"Our hope is that Mr. Maliki will not stir those waters.\"\n\nMaliki's speech on Sunday followed President Fouad Masoum's missed deadline to appoint a new prime minister, prompting angry accusations from Maliki and concern from US officials. The Wall Street Journal reports that US officials were alarmed by Maliki's fiery speech and his call for the Iraqi army to protect the country's constitution.\n\nRumors swirled in Baghdad about potential political upheaval, with reports of tanks and loyal special forces units in the Green Zone of government buildings. A senior Iraqi official told The New York Times that Maliki had \"gone out of his mind\" and was living in a different reality. A Kurdish news agency reported that presidential guards were on high alert to protect the presidential palace.\n\nHowever, an official at Iraq's Ministry of the Interior told the Wall Street Journal that the extra security was in anticipation of a terrorist attack and was not related to politics. Finding a replacement for Maliki, who has been criticized for promoting his ethnicity above the country's Sunnis and Kurds, has proven difficult.\n\nThe country's highest court ruled that Maliki's State of Law bloc is the biggest in the new parliament, making it problematic for attempts to have President Masoud offer the premiership to an alternative candidate. On Sunday, the deputy speaker of Iraq's parliament, Haider al-Abadi, a member of Maliki's party, said in a tweet that a bloc of Shiite parties was close to choosing a new prime minister. Critics accuse Abadi, too, of sectarianism.\n\nThe situation remains fluid, with the potential for further political developments. The US and international community continue to express their hope for a peaceful and swift resolution to the ongoing political impasse in Iraq.",
    " Title: Federal Raid in Ohio Highlights Immigration Policy Dilemma, Caravan Crisis Elicits Polarized Response\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal raid in Sandusky, Ohio, in June, involving approximately 200 agents and resulting in the detention of 114 undocumented immigrants working at Corso's Flower and Garden Center, has brought the immigration policy dilemma to the forefront. The raid, which targeted workers who had been in the country on and off for decades, has sparked discussions about the enforcement of immigration policy and its impact on individuals trying to work and support their families.\n\nThe Corso raid serves as a backdrop for the current crisis involving a migrant caravan making its way from Guatemala and Honduras, causing concern and controversy in Washington, D.C. The caravan, primarily composed of families, has been a contentious issue, with some advocating for the deployment of the U.S. military and other drastic measures, while others view it as a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe caravan's composition, consisting of many women and children, challenges the notion that the migrant crisis is primarily a matter of national security. While some may argue that the caravan is a threat to national security, the majority of the migrants are not gang members or terrorists.\n\nPresident Trump has expressed his intention to use the military to stop the caravan from crossing the southern border, which would violate the Posse Comitatus Act, a law that prevents the military from enforcing civilian laws. The use of the military against a civilian caravan, primarily composed of women and children, raises ethical questions and concerns about the potential for violence.\n\nThe political response to the caravan has been polarized, with Republicans viewing it as a means to rally their base for the mid-term elections, while Democrats argue that the caravan is a humanitarian crisis that requires compassion and a solution-oriented approach.\n\nThe immigration crisis calls for a balanced, patient, and compassionate response, involving leniency and a path to citizenship for long-time undocumented residents already in the country, as well as support for President Trump's border wall. However, these measures will not fully address the root causes of immigration, as the United States, being the world's richest country, is located adjacent to some of the world's poorest and most violent countries.\n\nAs long as the economic and security imbalance between the United States and its neighboring countries persists, migration will continue to be a pressing issue. The army and the wall will not stop all migrants, but a comprehensive, multi-national approach, involving the affected nations in Central America, Mexico, and the United States, may help alleviate the crisis and restore order along the southern border.",
    " Title: Reddit Permanently Bans Over 2,000 Communities for Hate Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the ongoing protests for gender, racial, and LGBTQ+ equality, social media platform Reddit has decided to shut down approximately 2,000 communities that have a history of hate speech. With nearly 430 million monthly visitors, Reddit is one of the most popular websites globally.\n\nThe affected communities include subreddits such as \"Gender Critical,\" a trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF) forum, \"The Donald,\" a pro-Trump forum, and \"CapoTrapHouse,\" a radical left forum. While the company did not name every community being removed, it provided a list of at least 10: \"The_Donald,\" \"Gender Critical,\" \"CapoTrapHouse,\" \"Dark Humor And Memes,\" \"Consume Product,\" \"Cum Town,\" \"ImGoingtoHellforThis2,\" \"Wojak,\" and \"Soy Boys.\"\n\nSubreddits are user-run communities, with over 100,000 active subreddits. Rules for these forums, as well as the enforcement of such policies, are typically controlled by its moderator or creator. However, Reddit administrators have the power to intervene when users break the site's rules.\n\nIn a statement, the company stated, \"All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods [moderators] have refused to meet our most basic expectations.\"\n\nSimilar reasons were given for the ban of \"ChapoTrapHouse,\" which consistently hosted rule-breaking content and its moderators demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.\n\n\"The_Donald,\" specifically, has promoted hate speech even before the 2016 election. After it was created in June 2015, it quickly became a hub for extreme political ideas. Despite other communities complaining to Reddit, \"The_Donald\" posts were still visible due to users' ability to \"upvote\" or \"downvote\" certain posts, with people with the most influence able to drive the most popular posts to the front page of the site.\n\nLast year, Reddit attempted to address the problem by isolating \"The_Donald\" users from the rest of the site, but the measure was short-lived. The Southern Poverty Law Center published a report on \"The_Donald\" in April 2018, highlighting users' paranoia about \"white genocide\" and their support of ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Myanmar.\n\nAnother affected subreddit, \"Gender Critical,\" is one of the site's most active feminist communities for \"women-centered, radical feminists\" that consistently spews anti-trans rhetoric. With over 64,000 members, \"Gender Critical\" users have regularly denied that trans women are women and have vocally supported JK Rowling's TERF tirade.\n\nIn the \"Gender Critical\" archives, members have also blasted gender-neutral or trans-inclusive language written by trans allies and have had hateful discussions about denying trans women access to bathrooms.\n\nReddit concluded, \"Ultimately, it's our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.\"\n\nThe company also reiterated that the purge of 2,000 communities is just the beginning of its mission to create more rules around hate speech.",
    " Title: Conservative Media's Use of \"Fake News\" Label Challenged\n\nArticle:\n\nConservative media outlets have increasingly employed the term \"fake news\" to discredit mainstream media, a move that some critics argue is an attempt to undermine the credibility of established news sources. Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, a liberal media watchdog group, stated, \"What I think is so unsettling about the 'fake news' cries now is that their audience has already sort of bought into this idea that journalism has no credibility or legitimacy.\" By applying the term to credible outlets, it becomes more believable, according to Carusone.\n\nExamples of this trend can be seen in the conservative media's coverage of recent events. When coverage of Andrew F. Puzder, President Trump's choice for labor secretary, highlighted his opposition to minimum wage increases, writer and radio host Erick Erickson wrote that Mr. Puzder should have been given more credit for his stance, labeling as \"fake news\" any reporting that suggested minimum wage increases lead to higher unemployment. However, the effects of minimum wage increases have been found to vary from city to city.\n\nInfowars, a website run by conservative provocateur and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, labeled as \"fake news\" a CNN report that Ivanka Trump would move into the office in the White House normally reserved for the first lady.\n\nPresident Trump himself has used the term to deny news reports, as he did on Twitter recently after various outlets reported that he would remain as the executive producer of \"The New Celebrity Apprentice\" after taking office in January. \"Ridiculous & untrue \u2014 FAKE NEWS!\" he wrote. While it is confirmed that Trump will be credited as executive producer, it is unclear what, if any, work he will do on the show.\n\nMany conservatives are pushing back against the outrage over \"fake news,\" believing that liberals, unwilling to accept President Trump's victory, are attributing his triumph to nefarious external factors. Laura Ingraham, author and radio host, stated, \"The left refuses to admit that the fundamental problem isn't the Russians or Jim Comey or 'fake news' or the Electoral College. 'Fake news' is just another fake excuse for their failed agenda.\"",
    " Title: House Intelligence Committee Subpoenas Rudy Giuliani in Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Democrat-led House Intelligence Committee has issued a subpoena to President Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, as part of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry into alleged attempts by President Trump to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nIn a letter signed by House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA), House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel (D-NY), and House Oversight Committee Chair Elijah Cummings (D-MD), and posted on the House Oversight Committee's official website on Monday, Giuliani is ordered to produce documents related to the Democrats' Ukraine investigation by Oct. 15.\n\nThe letter begins, \"Pursuant to the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, we are hereby transmitting a subpoena that compels you to produce the documents set forth in the accompanying schedule by October 15, 2019.\" The subpoena is issued by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in consultation with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Oversight and Reform, and is part of the House's impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe letter continues, \"The subpoenaed documents shall be collected as part of the House's impeachment inquiry and shared among the Committees, as well as with the Committee on the Judiciary as appropriate.\" The letter warns that failure to comply with the subpoena, including at the direction or behest of the President or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against Giuliani and the President.\n\nThe Democrats' inquiry includes an investigation of allegations that Giuliani acted as an agent of the President in a scheme to advance Trump's personal political interests by abusing the power of the Office of the President. The letter states that the President, Giuliani, and others appear to have pressed the Ukrainian government to pursue two politically-motivated investigations. The first is a prosecution of Ukrainians who provided evidence against Trump's convicted campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. The second relates to former Vice President Joe Biden, who is challenging President Trump for the presidency in 2020.\n\nThe letter cites Giuliani's admission on national television that he personally asked the Ukrainian government to target Biden, and states that Giuliani is in possession of evidence indicating that other Trump Administration officials may have been involved in this scheme. The subpoena requires Giuliani to produce all of those communications and other related documents to the Committees in order to determine the full extent of this effort by the President and his Administration to press Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe letter concludes by ordering Giuliani to contact staff for the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to arrange for the production of documents.\n\nThough Democrats are accusing Trump of trying to \"cover up\" his July 25 call to his Ukrainian counterpart, which Trump has repeatedly defended as a \"perfect\" call, Trump authorized the release of the transcript of the call last week. In the call, Trump asked Zelensky to \"look into\" the alleged corruption scandal involving the Ukraine-based company Burisma Holdings that hired Hunter Biden just weeks after his father was appointed by then-President Barack Obama to oversee Ukraine-U.S. relations. Biden eventually used the threat of withholding $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to force the removal of the country's top prosecutor, who had been investigating Burisma for alleged corruption.",
    " Title: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Protests CNN's Exclusion from Democratic Town Hall\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) has expressed her discontent with CNN after the network did not include her in a Democratic town hall event scheduled for February 11, just days before the New Hampshire primary.\n\nLast week, CNN announced its lineup for a two-night town hall event set in New Hampshire on February 12 and 13. The event will feature eight Democratic candidates: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), businessman Andrew Yang, and billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer on the first night; and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and former Gov. Deval Patrick (D-Mass.) on the second night.\n\nGabbard, who is outpolling Patrick in national polls and outpolls Patrick, Steyer, and Yang in New Hampshire, was noticeably absent from CNN's roster. In response, her campaign has announced a demonstration outside the New Hampshire venue where the CNN town halls will take place.\n\n\"This attempt to silence Tulsi is bigger than one person -- it\u2019s our right as voters to hear from ALL the candidates, and to have our voices represented. No institution should be allowed to get away with censoring democracy: That\u2019s why we\u2019re standing up to CNN on Wednesday, February 5th, demanding that our voices be heard,\" the Gabbard campaign said.\n\nCNN did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nGabbard told Fox News last week, \"We have reached out, I think, more than once, and we received no explanation. I don't even think we've gotten a response to date about why they're excluding the first female combat veteran ever to run for president, the only woman of color in the race.\"\n\nThe two other candidates who are not scheduled to partake in the CNN town halls are Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. It is unclear if they received an invitation to participate.",
    " Title: Senate's Gang of Eight Launches Aggressive Lobbying Campaign for Immigration Overhaul\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate's bipartisan group known as the Gang of Eight is actively engaging in an aggressive lobbying campaign to address conservative opposition to a comprehensive immigration overhaul bill. The group aims to present the measure as a workable compromise on a complex issue, potentially broadening the Republican Party's appeal to Latino and moderate voters.\n\nFollowing the bill's unveiling at 2 a.m. on Wednesday, members of the Gang of Eight have been actively promoting the bill on conservative talk radio and encouraging their colleagues to withhold criticism until they have had an opportunity to analyze the legislation.\n\nThe lobbying effort is part of a broader strategy to facilitate the bill's passage in the Senate, with the goal of attracting more than a handful of Republican senators. Proponents believe that a broadly supported bill in the Senate would put House Republicans in a difficult position to reject it.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a member of the gang, stated, \"Defining the bill quickly is good. We're going to be aggressive in marketing the bill. We're going to be open-minded about making it better. But this is an all-hands-on-deck approach.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Graham and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) made multiple appearances on conservative talk radio, with Rubio planning additional appearances on Thursday. The initial response on the right was less intense than anticipated, according to proponents. Rubio's offices in Washington and Florida reported receiving fewer than 500 calls on immigration-related issues on Wednesday, with more than 150 of those calls expressing support for the bill.\n\nSome GOP senators have expressed caution, stating they will wait to review the bill's details before making a decision. Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) are among those who have expressed reservations.\n\nOn the Democratic side, efforts are being made to rally support from their own base. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), another leading supporter, and Democratic senators privately met with immigration activists to encourage them to support the bill for the \"greater good\" of passing the legislation. The White House is also engaging with House Democrats, with a senior White House official, Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, meeting with House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) to offer broad support for the bill and address concerns about the bill's treatment of undocumented immigrants. The White House also seeks revisions to the bill.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Limits Scope of Travel Ban Executive Order\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent decision, the Supreme Court partially endorsed the administration's view that the president has significant authority to control immigration, particularly for individuals with no ties to the United States. The court's opinion suggests that some justices may believe that President Trump exceeded this broad authority with his attempts to impose a blanket ban on entry to the United States from certain predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nThe travel ban, as limited by the court's decision, will be significantly narrower than the one proposed in Trump's first week in office and a later, revised version. The decision marks a rare legal victory for Trump after months of lower court rulings that criticized him for imposing a de facto ban on Muslims entering the country.\n\nIn May, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va., stated that the president's revised order \"drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.\"\n\nIn response, officials at the Department of Homeland Security stated that the court's decision would allow the department \"to largely implement the President's executive order.\" Trump also used similar language, stating that his travel ban would now \"become largely effective.\"\n\nHowever, critics of the ban, such as Cecillia Wang, the deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, disputed these assessments. Wang stated that the opinion means the ban would not apply to many people while the court case proceeds.\n\n\"Clearly, the White House press statement today is based on alternative facts,\" Wang said.\n\nThe court's decision could lead to months of administrative and legal wrangling as consular officials attempt to determine which people are allowed to seek entry into the United States and which are barred by the opinion.",

The State Department has acknowledged reports of rockets landing in the International Zone, but did not specify the embassy or the extent of any injuries.\n\nThe State Department spokesperson stated that the security situation remains tense, with Iranian-backed armed groups posing a threat. They urged the Iraqi government to take action to protect diplomatic facilities.\n\nRecent months have seen multiple attacks in Baghdad's Green Zone, where the U.S. Embassy and other Western countries' embassies are located. The State Department spokesperson reported 14 attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq, which they attribute to Iran and Iranian-backed militias.\n\nIraq has been caught in the middle of escalating tensions between Iran and the U.S. in recent months. Protests erupted at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad following the U.S.'s strike on an Iranian-backed militia, which it claims was responsible for the death of a U.S. contractor in an attack.\n\nThe U.S. also carried out a strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani at the Baghdad airport, prompting Iran to threaten retaliation and strike multiple Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops. This attack resulted in the brain injuries of 34 service members, the Pentagon announced on Friday.\n\nThe State Department spokesperson did not directly attribute Sunday's strike to Iran, and Iran has not taken responsibility for the attack.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul (Texas), the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, expressed concern in a tweet about the rocket attacks on the embassy. He stated, \"I am closely monitoring reports of a rocket attack targeting the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Violent acts against our diplomatic facilities are simply unacceptable. We must ensure the safety of American diplomats, troops, and other Americans in Iraq.\"\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi condemned the strike, stating that Iraqi forces will investigate to prevent future attacks and punish the perpetrators.",
    " Title: MSF Accused of Reinforcing Colonialism and White Supremacy by 1,000 Employees\n\nArticle: M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), a global medical aid organization, has been accused of reinforcing \"colonialism and white supremacy\" by over a thousand current and former employees in a letter to the NGO's management. The signatories have demanded an investigation into the activities of the organization, which provides medical services worldwide and has previously engaged in transporting migrants across the Mediterranean from North Africa.\n\nProminent members of the organization, including board members in the UK and southern Africa, have spoken out about the group's perceived faults. They called for the elimination of \"decades of power and paternalism\" in the organization, according to Franceinfo. Other signatories denounced a so-called \"white savior\" mentality among members of the organization.\n\nThe letter reportedly came in response to a statement released by the Italian branch of MSF that suggested members should discuss how \"all lives matter,\" which some saw as conflicting with the Black Lives Matter movement. Italy's MSF president, Claudia Lodesani, later apologized for the statement, stating that she and the Italian branch fully support and stand with the BLM movement and condemn racism and all discrimination.\n\nDr. Christos Christou, the international president of MSF, welcomed the letter. He said, \"Our priority is to shift the decision-making closer to where the needs are, and involving the patients and community in designing strategies of intervention. To shrink the decision-making power of Europe and redistribute it to the rest of the world.\"\n\nMSF halted its partnership with the French migrant transport NGO SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e in April. However, the latter NGO and its ship, the Ocean Viking, have resumed operations in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the Ocean Viking picked up around 180 migrants but was initially denied access to ports in Italy and Malta. The ship was later granted access to a port in Italy after unrest among the migrants on board was reported, including several threats to the crew and suicide attempts by migrants.",
    " Title: Trump-Democrat Infrastructure Meeting Disruption Affects White House Priorities, Including USMCA Trade Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington \u2013 President Donald Trump's abrupt departure from an infrastructure meeting with Democrats has left lawmakers questioning the impact on other White House priorities, such as the pending trade deal with Canada and Mexico, known as the USMCA.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump walked out of the meeting, expressing his frustration over ongoing Democratic investigations into his presidency. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accused the president of throwing a \"temper tantrum for us all to see.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday, the president characterized the truncated meeting as calm and dismissed the Democratic and media portrayal of the event as a \"rage.\"\n\nTrump has indicated that he may delay most of his legislative agenda until after the 2020 election, acknowledging the unlikely consensus between Democrats and Republicans on many issues, as the Democratic primary race heats up.\n\nIn a hastily arranged statement Wednesday in the Rose Garden, Trump stated that Washington could not be on an \"investigations\" track while pursuing legislation. He added, \"Let them play their games. We're going to go down one track at a time.\"\n\nThe status of several White House priorities, including the USMCA trade deal and government funding, remains uncertain following Wednesday's outburst. Daniel Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade attorney, stated that the USMCA's prospects have become even more doubtful due to the latest squabble.\n\nThe USMCA faces a high hurdle in the Democratic-controlled House. The deal's approval would allow Trump to honor his campaign promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nAnother potential issue is the funding for the government after September and the raising of the nation's debt ceiling. The White House and lawmakers were making progress this week on a two-year agreement to avoid another government shutdown and the potential for a financial crisis if the government is forced to default on its debt.\n\nWhite House officials did not respond to questions about the trade agreement. An administration official stated that negotiations on the budget and the debt ceiling continued between the White House and Congress.\n\nIn a series of late-night tweets last month, the president said Republicans would not vote on a health care plan until after the election. \"Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win \u2026 back the House,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nAs the president rolled out the broad outlines of a proposal to deal with legal immigration, he conceded that Democrats might not embrace his ideas.

    " Title: Attorney General Holder: Domestic Drone Strikes on Americans Unlikely but Not Impossible\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a letter to U.S. Senator Rand Paul, Attorney General Eric Holder has stated that while it is theoretically possible for the U.S. government to authorize the use of lethal force, including drone strikes, against American citizens on U.S. soil in extraordinary circumstances, such a scenario is unlikely to occur. The Attorney General's statement was made in response to questions raised during the confirmation process for John Brennan, who was nominated to head the CIA.\n\nIn his letter, Holder outlined potential extraordinary circumstances that might warrant such action, such as protecting the homeland in the aftermath of attacks like the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington or the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. However, he emphasized that the administration prefers to use law enforcement authorities to incapacitate terrorist threats rather than military force.\n\nSenator Paul, who had threatened to hold up Brennan's nomination until he received a full response to his query, was not satisfied with Holder's response. Paul stated, \"The U.S. attorney general's refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes on American citizens and on American soil is more than frightening. It is an affront to the constitutional due process rights of all Americans.\"\n\nCNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin noted that Holder made it clear in his letter that he would have to examine the facts of each situation separately and advise the president on his legal authority. Toobin added, \"Again, he made a point of saying Sen. Rand Paul's question is hypothetical at this time. But at some point down the road, this may not be hypothetical.\"\n\nThe issue of targeting American terror suspects with lethal force was brought into sharp focus in 2011 when Anwar al-Awlaki, a New Mexico-born individual, was killed in a drone strike in Yemen. Officials stated that he played an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The Obama administration has maintained that targeting Americans overseas with drones is only permitted when the U.S. government determines a suspect to be an imminent threat to the United States and when capture would not be feasible, and all applicable laws must apply.\n\nThe Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel released new documents on its legal rationale to the Senate intelligence panel on the same day. Key members who had been pressing for this information expressed satisfaction with the White House's cooperation, stating, \"We are pleased that we now have the access that we have long sought and need to conduct the vigilant oversight with which the committee has been charged. We believe that this sets an important precedent for applying our American system of checks and balances to the challenges of 21st-century warfare. We look forward to reviewing and discussing these documents in the days ahead.\" They credited Paul with raising the use of drones domestically as a question of \"fundamental importance.\"",
    " Title: President Obama's 2012 Income and Tax Returns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2012, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama reported a nearly $609,000 income, with approximately 40% coming from book sales. The majority of their income, about $608,611, came from the president's salary, book royalties, and other sources.\n\nThe Obamas paid $112,214 in federal taxes last year, resulting in an effective federal tax rate of 18.4%. The first family donated almost a quarter of their income to charity, according to tax returns released by the White House.\n\nMost of the income from book sales came from the president's memoir \"Dreams From My Father,\" his 2006 political book \"The Audacity of Hope,\" and a 2010 children's book \"Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.\"\n\nIncome from Obama's books has decreased since 2009, when the Obamas made $5.5 million, but the figure dropped precipitously the next year to $1.73 million. In 2011, the Obamas reported about $790,000 in income.\n\nThe Obamas signed their tax returns on Monday, one week before the April 15 deadline for Americans to file their 2012 returns. Itemized deductions of $258,385 brought their taxable income down to $335,026. The first family deducted $45,056 in interest on the mortgage for their home in Chicago, plus $36,554 in state and local taxes and $26,751 in real estate taxes.\n\nThrough withholding and estimated tax payments during the year, the Obamas paid $129,029 to the Internal Revenue Service, an overpayment of $16,815. The Obamas directed that, rather than receive a refund, the overpayment will be applied to their taxes for next year.\n\nThe Obamas also claimed $39,875 in income from outside the United States. A White House official said all of that income came from book royalties, but did not disclose details about which countries the income came from.\n\nThe president and first lady reported donating $150,034, or 24.6% of their income, to 33 charities. The largest contribution last year was a $103,871 donation to Fisher House Foundation. Other charitable groups that received donations from the president for $5,000 or less include the American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and the United Negro College Fund.\n\nThe president and the first lady also paid $29,450 in income taxes to Illinois, according to their state tax returns. The White House also released tax returns for Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden. The Bidens paid $87,851 in federal income taxes on $385,072 in adjusted gross income, for an effective federal tax rate of 22.8%. The vice president and his wife paid state income taxes in two states -- $13,531 in Delaware and $3,593 in Virginia. They reported donating $7,190 to charity.",
    " Title: Republican Response to Obama's Deportation Suspension Remains Ambiguous\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has garnered significant attention, President Obama announced on Friday the suspension of deportations for some illegal immigrants. This decision, while met with criticism from some Republicans, has been met with a relatively passive response from the party, particularly in an election year known for its partisan rhetoric.\n\nWhile some Republicans, such as Rick Santorum and Alberto Gonzales, have denounced the president's decision, others have taken a more equivocal stance. Notable figures like William Kristol have praised the decision outright, while Marco Rubio has pushed back on the circumstances rather than the substance of the decision.\n\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, has yet to take a clear stance on the issue. Despite Romney's conservative immigration stance during the primaries, he has largely avoided questions about the decision. This ambiguity could potentially lead to accusations of flip-flopping, but candidates often adjust their positions when they perceive the alternative to be more costly.\n\nThe ambiguous response from the Republican party could be a strategic move, as the party seems to be acknowledging the changing demographics of the United States. In the years leading up to the 2008 presidential election, the \"emerging Democratic majority\" theory was proposed, suggesting that groups more favorable to Democrats were becoming a larger share of the American population. Hispanic voters, who represented about 9 percent of voters in the 2008 election, have been a key focus of this theory.\n\nHistorically, Hispanics have not been as likely to register to vote as other groups, but voting participation has been relatively low, even among those who are registered. However, Mr. Obama's decision could potentially motivate additional turnout among these voters. If, for instance, Hispanic turnout increases by 5 percent, and 5 percent of Hispanics who might otherwise have voted for Mr. Romney now vote for Mr. Obama instead, it would swing a net of about 1 percentage point in support to Mr. Obama.\n\nIt is important to note that Hispanic and Asian-American voters care about more than just immigration. A survey in December by the Pew Hispanic Center found that only about one-third of Hispanic registered voters listed immigration as an extremely important issue, whereas close to 50 percent said the same of jobs, education, and health care.\n\nIn the Pew survey and in others, Mr. Obama's approval ratings have not always been outstanding among Hispanic voters. However, relatively few have said that they plan to vote for Mr. Romney. The danger for Democrats was that these voters, unenthusiastic about both choices, might not have turned out to vote at all. This decision could potentially mitigate that risk.",
    " Title: Shift in Criticism: Republicans Focus on Hillary Clinton After Benghazi Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing Wednesday's Benghazi hearing, the focus of criticism has reportedly shifted from President Barack Obama to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The incident in Benghazi, Libya, is seen by many on the right as a significant scandal, with the initial response by the State Department and the White House being perceived as a cover-up during the 2012 presidential election, less than two months away at the time.\n\nIn the aftermath of the hearing by the GOP-led House Oversight Committee, a pro-Republican opposition research group, America Rising PAC, released an email with the headline \"Benghazi Hearing Raises Serious Questions About Clinton.\" The group followed up with a web video on Thursday, titled \"The Serious Questions Raised About Hillary Clinton's Leadership in the House Oversight Committee Hearing.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee, American Crossroads, the Karl Rove-backed pro-GOP super PAC, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a potential 2016 GOP White House contender, also issued critical emails and videos regarding Clinton, America's top diplomat at the time of the attack.\n\nWhile the president remains in the crosshairs of Republicans and conservatives, 2016 politics are also at play in this story. Obama is ineligible to run for a third term, and Clinton, who is considering a presidential bid, would be the instant front-runner for the Democratic nomination if she decides to run.\n\nClinton stepped down as secretary of state with high poll numbers, but the incident in Benghazi is seen as a stain on her record at the State Department. An independent review of the Benghazi incident, led by Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and former ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, found no wrongdoing by Clinton. However, critics noted that neither Mullen nor Pickering interviewed Clinton.\n\nBefore stepping down in late January, Clinton testified for hours on Capitol Hill on the Benghazi attack. She was forceful in her defense, and the conventional wisdom at the time was that she was not politically wounded. However, the story was given new life thanks to the House hearing, which showcased the testimony of State Department whistleblowers who had not previously testified, including the riveting details from an official who was on the ground in Tripoli at the time of the attack in Benghazi.\n\nThe question now is whether any smoking gun emerged from Wednesday's hearing regarding what Clinton knew and when she knew it. Republicans and Democrats obviously disagree on this question.\n\n\"I rather doubt the current right-wing demagoguery is going to hurt Hillary if she chooses to run,\" said Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala, who was a top political adviser in Bill Clinton's White House. \"It is increasingly looking like the only president named Clinton may be Bill,\" he added.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner called on the president to release emails on Thursday that he claims show how the White House wanted to change the Benghazi attack \"talking points.\" The question now is whether this story will continue to unfold in the coming days and weeks.",
    " Title: Cruz Expresses Optimism for Defunding Obamacare, Faces Opposition from Both Parties\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has proposed a plan to defund President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law by withholding funding for the federal government, but he admitted in an interview this week that he does not currently have enough Republican support to make the idea a reality.\n\n\"We do not have the votes right now,\" Cruz said, noting that to succeed, he would need 41 senators or 218 representatives to back his legislation, which would provide a year of funding for the federal government, minus Obamacare.\n\nHowever, Cruz argued a coming \"grass-roots tsunami\" would bring over fellow conservatives to his side in the next month. \"I'm convinced there's a new paradigm in politics, that actually has Washington very uncomfortable,\" he said. \"And it has politicians in both parties very uncomfortable.\"\n\nCruz's opponents argue he is risking a government shutdown in order to repeal Obama's health law, and claim the president would never sign a measure defunding the signature legislation of his five years in office.\n\nBut Cruz casts the effort differently: Democrats would be the ones shutting the government down if they refuse to support a measure that funds all federal programs except Obamacare.\n\n\"President Obama, Harry Reid, will scream and holler that the mean, nasty Republicans are threatening to shut down the government,\" Cruz said. \"And at that point, Republicans have to do something we have not done in a long time - stand up and win the argument.\"\n\nCruz has support for his plan from a handful of Republicans in Congress, including Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Mike Lee (R-UT), but many others in his party have said the plan risks alienating Americans who are tired of seeing the federal government's finances put in the middle of partisan bickering.\n\nEstablishment figures like Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and last year's GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, have voiced opposition to the plan, as has Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a tea party-backed senator who has aligned with Cruz in the past.\n\nDemocrats also fiercely oppose the tactic, including former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who appeared on \"State of the Union\" Sunday.\n\n\"These are crazy ideas from the far right,\" Dean said, calling Cruz \"a slick spokesman.\"\n\n\"God help us if he gets to be anything more than the senator from Texas,\" he added.\n\nCruz was speaking with CNN in Houston, where he appeared at a town hall meeting that was part of a tour sponsored by the conservative Heritage Foundation meant to build support for the effort to defund Obamacare.\n\n\"Obamacare was passed under false pretenses,\" Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, a former senator, said on \"State of the Union\" Sunday. \"The American people were lied to and they have every right to demand that their representatives stop this unfair and un-American law.\"\n\nWatch State of the Union with Candy Crowley Sundays at 9am ET.

    " Title: Texas Senate Race: Cruz and O'Rourke Engage in Heated Debate on Domestic Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated debate on Friday night in Dallas, Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke engaged in a lively exchange during the first of three debates. The focus of the debate was domestic policy, with the candidates sparring on issues such as immigration, healthcare, gun control, and the national anthem protests by professional football players.\n\nSenator Cruz portrayed O'Rourke as a politician \"out of step with the people of Texas\" and associated him with socialist policies, citing his stance on abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), gun control, and impeaching President Trump. O'Rourke, in response, accused Cruz of prioritizing tax cuts for corporations over his constituents and of being an absentee senator who spent more time campaigning in Iowa than working for Texas.\n\nThe competitive Senate race between Cruz and O'Rourke has garnered significant attention, with recent polls showing the candidates running within single digits of each other. The Cook Political Report recently reclassified the race as a toss-up, a significant development in Texas, which has not elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994. The outcome of the race could potentially impact the balance of power in the Senate, as Democrats aim to retake control of the Senate from Republicans.\n\nImmigration and border security were key areas of disagreement between the two candidates. Cruz emphasized the need for border security, including the construction of a wall, technology, infrastructure, and increased law enforcement presence. O'Rourke, on the other hand, advocated for bringing undocumented immigrants out of the shadows and allowing them to legalize their status.\n\nThe debate also touched on gun control, with Cruz supporting the Second Amendment and O'Rourke advocating for universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons. The candidates' positions on guns, police violence, and mass shootings were particularly animated, as the area has recently grappled with high-profile incidents of police violence and mass shootings.\n\nThe next debates between Cruz and O'Rourke are scheduled for September 30 in Houston and October 16 in San Antonio.",
    " Title: McConnell Secures 51 Votes for Impeachment Trial Rules Without Witness Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has reportedly secured the 51 votes necessary to establish the rules for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial without a concrete agreement on witnesses. According to multiple reports, McConnell informed colleagues during a closed-door lunch on Tuesday that he had secured the necessary backing to begin the trial.\n\nThe decision comes despite protests from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who stated, \"Republicans may run but they can\u2019t hide\" from the question of whether witnesses and documents will be called in the trial. Schumer declared, \"There will be votes at the beginning on whether to call the four witnesses we\u2019ve proposed and subpoena the documents we\u2019ve identified.\"\n\nDemocrats have argued that White House officials who have first-hand knowledge of President Trump's dealings with Ukraine, such as former adviser John Bolton, should be required to testify during the trial. Bolton said Monday that he would testify if subpoenaed.\n\nMcConnell has been planning the trial in a format similar to that of former President Bill Clinton's trial, with opening arguments being held before a vote to determine which witnesses, if any, would be called to testify.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) stated before the lunch that Republican leadership was \"trying to get consensus among Republicans about how to go forward.\" Thune added, \"We are taking the temperature of our members to see where they are but I\u2019m hoping our members will be prepared to move forward along the lines of the Clinton rules which is what we think makes sense.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has delayed sending the articles over to the Senate, but Republicans have been ramping up pressure on her to deliver them. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a resolution on Monday that would preemptively dismiss the articles if they aren't sent over in a timely manner.",
    " Title: Obama Stresses Economic Progress and Focus on Action for 2014\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his opening remarks, President Barack Obama emphasized the signs of economic growth and stated that building on such progress would be the focus of his efforts in the year ahead. However, he did not provide specific details about his agenda for the year, despite citing improvements in employment, growth, and deficits.\n\nThe news conference began with a question about whether 2014 had been the worst year of his presidency. In response, Mr. Obama offered a reflective review of a year that started with the optimistic language, high hopes, and call for political unity in his second Inaugural Address. He acknowledged the numerous challenges faced since the January celebration, including setbacks on immigration, budget policy, gun violence, and health care.\n\nDespite these disappointments, Mr. Obama maintained a resilient demeanor, joking about the numerous \"near-death experiences\" he has faced during his presidency. His approval ratings have reached a record low, and many Democrats have expressed disillusionment due to controversies over the health insurance law and revelations about widespread intelligence surveillance of phone records.\n\nAs the first year of his second term comes to a close, Mr. Obama finds himself in a Congress where Republicans are more determined than ever to obstruct his initiatives before the midterm elections in 2014. This marks a challenging period for policy achievements, as the second term is typically the best opportunity for policy achievements before the lame-duck status sets in.",
    " Title: Biden Declares Equality Act as Top Legislative Priority, Vows to Address Discrimination Against LGBTQ Community\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has declared that the Equality Act will be his top legislative priority if elected, aiming to enshrine LGBTQ protections into the nation's labor and civil rights laws. The former vice president made this statement during a keynote address at the Human Rights Campaign's annual Ohio gala, marking the beginning of Pride Month.\n\nIn his half-hour speech, Biden praised the resilience of the activists in attendance and criticized the policies of President Donald Trump. He cited several Trump administration actions, including attempts to bar transgender troops in the U.S. military, allow medical professionals to refuse treatment to LGBTQ individuals, and allow homeless shelters to deny admission to transgender individuals.\n\nBiden stated, \"It's wrong and it is immoral what they're doing.\" He also noted that the Equality Act, which recently passed the Democratic-run House but will not become law under Trump and the Republican Senate, would address many such discriminatory practices.\n\nThe Equality Act aims to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in areas including public accommodations, education, federal funding, employment, housing, credit, and jury service. If passed, it would extend and amend existing federal civil rights laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nBiden's visit to Ohio, a political battleground, was his first since the start of his presidential campaign. The event provided an opportunity for both Biden and the audience to discuss LGBTQ rights beyond the simplified framing of the 2020 landscape. Shawn Copeland, Ohio director for the Human Rights Campaign, noted the diversity of Ohio and the significant number of \"equality voters\" in the state.\n\nBiden used the forum to emphasize his long-standing alliance with the Human Rights Campaign and LGBTQ activists, recalling his 2012 announcement of his support for same-sex marriage before President Barack Obama had done so. He also addressed the widespread discrimination faced by the LGBTQ community, both in the U.S. and abroad, and spoke about the high rates of suicide attempts among LGBTQ children and teens.\n\nSeveral other Democratic presidential hopefuls have also addressed Human Rights Campaign state dinners this year. The organization has worked with the campaigns and state organizations to schedule these occasions. The choice to go to Ohio, according to a Biden campaign statement, demonstrates Biden's desire to have conversations about LGBTQ rights \"not just on the coasts of this country, but in the heartland and with any and all Americans.\"",
    " Title: Gay Rights Advocate Apologizes for Hosting Republican Senator Ted Cruz\n\nArticle:\n\nIan Reisner, one of two openly gay hoteliers who hosted Republican Senator Ted Cruz at a Manhattan event last week, has issued an apology following backlash from the LGBTQ+ community. In a post on his Facebook page over the weekend, Reisner expressed remorse for his actions, stating, \"I made a terrible mistake.\"\n\nReisner, along with his business partner Mati Weiderpass, are well-known New York real estate developers and advocates for gay rights. Their hotel, OUT NYC, is renowned for its gay-friendly atmosphere. The event with Cruz was intended to discuss common ground on issues such as Israel.\n\nOnce news of the event leaked, a wave of criticism ensued, with some members of the LGBTQ+ community accusing Reisner of being unaware of Cruz's opposition to same-sex marriage and his political stance in favor of states determining the definition of marriage. However, it is unclear whether Reisner was genuinely unaware of Cruz's views or if the apology was a response to public pressure.\n\nIn his apology, Reisner claimed, \"I've spent the past 24 hours reviewing videos of Cruz's statements on gay marriage and I am shocked and angry.\" He went on to express remorse for any hurt caused to the LGBTQ+ community and vowed to make amends for his poor judgment.\n\nThe term \"Gaystapo\" and \"The Big Gay McCarthy Hate Machine\" are used in the original text, but these terms are not recognized or widely used in mainstream media and may be considered derogatory or inflammatory. It is important to note that this article is intended to provide factual information and not to perpetuate any form of hate speech or discrimination.\n\nThe backlash against Reisner and Weiderpass led to boycotts and social media campaigns against their businesses. It is unclear how widespread these boycotts are or their impact on the businesses.\n\nBy issuing an apology, Reisner may have chosen to end the public pressure and avoid potential damage to his personal and professional life, as suggested in the original text. The apology serves as a reminder of the importance of public opinion and the potential consequences of associating with individuals or causes that are not in line with the beliefs of certain communities.",
    " Title: Milo Yiannopoulos Accuses Former Editor of Bias and Flirting in Unpublished Memoir Dispute\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, writer Milo Yiannopoulos has responded to comments made by his former editor, Mitch Ivers, regarding his unpublished memoir. Court documents have revealed Ivers' critical notes, such as \"unclear,\" \"unfunny,\" \"delete,\" which were made when Yiannopoulos sued the publisher, Simon & Schuster. The publishing house cancelled Yiannopoulos' book in February following the emergence of footage where he appeared to condone pedophilia.\n\nYiannopoulos has since accused Ivers of flirting with him and being biased against his work. The alt-right provocateur's critics have mocked him for the highly critical editorial feedback, with comments like \"The way you casually bring up the KKK makes no sense\" and \"This entire paragraph is just repeating Fake News. There was NO blood, NO semen and there was NO Satanism. Delete.\"\n\nIvers also attempted to make Yiannopoulos aware of his perceived image, advising, \"You MUST ACKNOWLEDGE that this is EXACTLY what people accuse you and Breitbart of being: a new age of partisan propaganda masquerading as journalism.\" \"This is definitely not the place for more of your narcissism,\" he added.\n\nWhen Yiannopoulos accused feminists of being \"more desperate to be noticed than Kanye West at an awards show,\" Ivers responded with \"This is what people say about you.\"\n\nIvers' scathing remarks were made public when lawyers for Simon & Schuster filed them in court in response to Yiannopoulos' July lawsuit, where he alleges breach of contract after the deal was cancelled in February.\n\nIn July 2016, Milo Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter for \"inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others.\" This action followed his comments directed at Leslie Jones, a black actress in an all-female Ghostbusters reboot, which led to a barrage of abuse from other Twitter users.\n\nYiannopoulos has also been widely criticized for comments he has made about transgender people, Muslims, Black Lives Matter activism, feminists, and gay people, despite being openly gay himself. Yiannopoulos, in a statement on social media, claimed, \"Mitchell Ivers, the liberal gay editor Simon & Schuster put in charge of neutering its edgier conservative authors, hates Republicans and thinks they are all virulent homophobes. He told me so himself.\" He further stated, \"Ivers said one thing in manuscript edits, but quite another when he was giggling and flirting with me.... I look forward to prevailing in court.\"",
    " Title: \"Secret Earpiece Speculation in Presidential Debates: A Recurring Election Theme\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Drudge Report, a prominent news aggregator, published a story on Thursday titled \"HILLARY AND THE EAR PEARL,\" which linked to an article from Infowars.com, a website known for promoting conspiracy theories. The story questioned whether Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was wearing a secret earpiece during the previous night's presidential forum, based on images that appeared to show a flesh-colored device in her ear.\n\nThe Infowars article, citing a tweet from actor and right-wing commentator James Woods, suggested that Clinton might have had someone secretly feeding her answers during the forum. The story gained traction, with Donald Trump Jr., the son of the Republican presidential nominee, sharing a link to the Infowars story on Twitter.\n\nThis \"secret earpiece\" story is not a new phenomenon in American politics. The first significant instance of such speculation emerged during the 2004 presidential election, when blogger Joseph Cannon noticed an odd bulge in George W. Bush's suit jacket during a debate. The speculative accusation gained traction, with some mainstream media outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, reporting on the issue. However, no direct evidence was ever produced to support the allegation that Bush was wired during the debate.\n\nIn 2008, during the Oct. 7 presidential debate, blogger Ann Althouse noticed an alleged earpiece in Barack Obama's ear and posted a photo of the device. She later retracted her claim, acknowledging that she was looking at light reflecting off Obama's ear, but left open the possibility that a secret earpiece might still exist.\n\nThe 2012 election saw less prominent earpiece speculation, though some chain emails circulated, accusing Obama of wearing an earpiece and having a suspicious bulge in his suit. The primary example of overwrought \"he's a cheater\" attacks during the 2012 cycle were directed at Republican contender Mitt Romney, who was accused of consulting crib notes during the first debate with Obama.\n\nThe relative lack of earpiece mania in 2012 has been more than compensated for in 2016, with the Clinton \"clandestine listening device\" story featured prominently on one of the world's most heavily trafficked political websites and endorsed by the son of the Republican nominee. Other Clinton-related conspiracies have proven to be remarkably persistent this cycle, with her allegedly failing health being the most prominent among them.\n\nJoseph Uscinski, a professor of political science at the University of Miami who has written extensively about political conspiracy theories, explained that these beliefs are dependent on a conspiracy worldview and partisanship. \"People point fingers at the other side,\" Uscinski said. \"If you're already predisposed to believe that a candidate from the other party is going to cheat, then you're more likely to take at face value an allegation that he or she cheated during a debate.\"\n\nThese cheating allegations tend to take the form of a secret earpiece because that's the only way someone participating in a nationally televised presidential debate could conceivably cheat, Uscinski added. \"It's just like when Hillary Clinton goes on [Jimmy Kimmel Live] and opens the pickle jar,\" Uscinski explained, referring to a humorous feat of strength that Clinton performed to mock questions about her health. \"The only way she could have cheated in that test...was to have a preopened pickle jar. It's sort of obvious that if people are going to be predisposed to thinking that cheating was taking place, that would be the method in which it would be done.\"\n\nIt remains unclear whether Matt Drudge and Donald Trump Jr. genuinely believe that Clinton was wired during the debate, but their actions legitimize the idea in the minds of those who are already inclined to believe it.",
    " Title: New Massachusetts Representative Seth Moulton's Military Service and Political Career\n\nArticle:\n\nSeth Moulton, the newly elected House Representative for Massachusetts' Sixth Congressional District, previously stated that he never aspired to become a politician. Instead, he joined the Marines shortly after graduating from Harvard University, just before the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. Moulton served four combat tours in Iraq, a war he has expressed doubts about, stating that this experience influenced his decision to run for office.\n\nDuring his campaign, Moulton's military service became a significant focus, as he unseated nine-term Democratic incumbent John Tierney in a primary challenge, the first successful primary challenge to a sitting Massachusetts congressman in two decades. He also defeated state Sen. Richard Tisei in the general election. Moulton received endorsements from high-ranking military officials such as Generals Stanley McChrystal and David Petraeus, and he emphasized reforming the Department of Veteran Affairs in his platform.\n\nIn an effort to distance himself from the trend of politicians boasting about their military connections, Moulton has been praised for downplaying his service history. He told The Boston Globe, \"There is a healthy disrespect among veterans who served on the front lines for people who walk around telling war stories.\"\n\nMoulton has been so discreet about his military career that he chose not to publicly disclose that he was twice decorated for heroism for his actions in Iraq, including receiving a Bronze Star in 2004. This information was not known to his parents until last month, according to a campaign spokesman.\n\nBesides campaigning for VA reform and criticizing the Iraq war and various aspects of President Obama's foreign policy, Moulton has also focused on other issues, such as fishing regulation in his district and his business experience. After leaving the Marines, he obtained an MBA from Harvard Business School and spent several years working at a startup.\n\nElected to a House of Representatives that is now Republican-controlled, Moulton's background and his secure position in a deep blue state could make him a significant figure in an otherwise challenging election night for Democrats.",
    " Title: Putin and Poroshenko Discuss Peace Deal for Eastern Ukraine, Ceasefire Agreed Upon\n\nArticle:\n\nRussian editor Fyodor Lukyanov stated that Russia aims to demonstrate control over the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine, with a focus on preventing Ukrainian forces from perceiving a potential military victory and accepting separatist leaders as negotiation partners. The specifics of the peace deal remain unclear due to complex diplomatic maneuvers and domestic politics.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Petro O. Poroshenko reportedly held an extensive telephone discussion regarding the conflict. Initially, Mr. Poroshenko's office announced a \"lasting cease-fire\" agreement, but later clarified that both leaders had only endorsed the need for a cease-fire, with Mr. Poroshenko expressing hope for earnest negotiations to begin on Friday. Mr. Putin claimed his notes were based on the telephone conversation.\n\nThe proposed plan, as outlined by Mr. Putin, includes Ukrainian artillery withdrawing and relocating out of range of separatist strongholds, an end to airstrikes, an exchange of all detainees, opening humanitarian corridors for residents of separatist areas, repairing damaged infrastructure, and deploying international observers to monitor the cease-fire.\n\nThe agreement does not mention autonomy for the separatist eastern regions, a central political demand that Russia has emphasized since March. This omission is widely perceived as crucial to Russia's long-term goal of maintaining influence over Ukraine's domestic affairs and obstructing any future Ukrainian attempts to join NATO.\n\nThe negotiations are set to take place in Minsk, Belarus, on Friday, with all parties involved in the talks, including representatives of the separatists. The two-day NATO summit meeting is also scheduled to conclude on Friday.",
    " Title: U.S. President Trump Defends Migrant Family Separation Policy Amidst Bipartisan Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has defended his administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, blaming Democrats and reiterating his stance against turning the United States into a \"migrant camp.\" The policy has faced increasing criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, with former first lady Laura Bush calling it \"cruel\" and \"immoral.\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have defended the policy, with Sessions calling on Congress to act and end the \"lawlessness.\" Nearly 2,000 children were separated from their families over a six-week period in April and May.\n\nU.S. protocol prohibits detaining children with their parents because the children are not charged with a crime and the parents are. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has argued that releasing parents with their children amounts to a \"get out of jail free card\" for those in the country illegally.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump, who has tended to stay out of contentious policy debates, has also waded into the issue, expressing her hope that both sides of the aisle can come together to achieve successful immigration reform.\n\nThe Rev. Franklin Graham, a longtime Trump ally, called the policy \"disgraceful.\" Several religious groups, including some conservative ones, have pushed to stop the practice of separating immigrant children from their parents.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci has criticized the administration for blaming Democrats and using the issue as a way of pressuring Democrats into negotiating on a Republican immigration bill. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has expressed deep concerns about the child separation policy.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has called the policy \"an utter atrocity that debases America's values and our legacy as a beacon of hope.\" Trump plans to meet with House Republicans on Tuesday to discuss pending immigration legislation amid the election-season debate. Both House proposals face broad opposition from Democrats, and even if a bill does pass, the closely divided Senate seems unlikely to go along.",
    " Title: Nine Key Battleground States in the 2012 Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2012 presidential race has narrowed to a core of nine states, a collection of margin-of-error battlegrounds spread across nearly every region. These states, ranging from New Hampshire in the Northeast to Nevada in the Rocky Mountain West, are generally agreed upon as key battlegrounds by both the Obama and Romney campaigns.\n\nAside from New Hampshire and Nevada, the seven other states are Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Some of these states are familiar presidential battlegrounds, accustomed to playing a pivotal role every four years. Others are relative newcomers to the swing state roster. Each of these nine states was carried by President Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nColorado, with nine electoral votes, is the biggest prize in the Mountain West. This explains why, for the two weeks preceding the conventions, two of the nation's top five media markets in terms of ad buys were Denver and Colorado Springs.\n\nThe Romney campaign strategy depends on turning out the GOP base, especially on the energy-oriented Western Slope and in El Paso County's Colorado Springs, home to a politically active evangelical Christian community and a heavy military influence. This year, the expectation among Republicans is that Romney will also gain more traction in the Denver suburbs than John McCain.\n\nThe Obama campaign strategy closely resembles the one successfully employed by Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet in 2010. Bennet ran well among Hispanics and benefited from an enormous gender gap\u201417 points, according to exit polls. The same themes Bennet used\u2014notably abortion rights and contraception\u2014have been put to use again in Colorado and were underscored at the Democratic convention in Charlotte last week.\n\nIt is worth noting that the president campaigned in Colorado with Sandra Fluke in early August, and he will return again later this week.\n\nA correction has been made to the story. The last year Wisconsin voted Republican at the presidential level was 1984.",
    " Title: Cashless Payments Gain Traction Amid Pandemic, Sparking Debate Over Convenience and Equity\n\nArticle:\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has led to a surge in the use of cashless payments, with nearly half of Americans opting for digital transactions when making in-person purchases, according to a YouGov poll. This shift is prompting businesses to implement cashless protocols, such as Starbucks' pledge to transition to cashless payments to minimize virus spread.\n\nProponents of cashless payments argue that they are more hygienic, faster, and more convenient. Cash can potentially spread germs, and cashless transactions are quicker, as demonstrated by the millions of Americans still waiting for their coronavirus stimulus checks, who could have received the funds directly into their bank accounts. Businesses would also save time and money by eliminating the need to handle cash, and there would be a decrease in thefts due to the absence of money in cash registers and improved payment tracking.\n\nHowever, opponents of cashless transactions argue that they are discriminatory, as they exclude individuals without bank accounts, such as the young, low-income, homeless, and undocumented. A cashless society would also be challenging for the less tech-savvy, such as the elderly, who may struggle to navigate digital systems. Critics also worry about the potential for increased hacking and privacy concerns, as well as logistical difficulties in a global digital banking system.\n\nChina is currently piloting the world's first digital national currency, and other countries are considering following suit. In the United States, there have been discussions about providing Americans with \"digital dollars\" for future stimulus relief and banking for the unbanked, but no legislation has been passed yet.\n\nEconomists and financial experts, such as Kenneth Rogoff and Gary Cohn, argue that digital wallets would have improved the government's ability to help individuals and small businesses during the pandemic. On the other hand, labor union president Stuart Appelbaum contends that a cashless business model is discriminatory and disadvantages low-income people, people of color, undocumented immigrants, and seniors.\n\nThe U.S. financial system's outdated and inefficient technologies have been exposed during the pandemic, and there is a growing consensus that the U.S. must invest in its financial infrastructure to promote economic growth and strategic influence abroad. The debate over cashless payments will likely continue as the pandemic evolves and businesses and governments weigh the benefits and drawbacks of going digital.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Cites Multiple Factors for 2016 Election Loss in CBS Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a CBS News interview, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose book \"What Happened\" is set to be released on September 12, outlined several reasons for her 2016 presidential election loss to Donald Trump. Clinton pointed to the FBI Director James Comey's letter announcing the reopening of the investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state as a significant factor in her defeat.\n\n\"I watched how analysts who I have a great deal of respect for, like Nate Silver, burrowed into all the data and said that 'but for that Comey letter, she would have won,'\" Clinton said.\n\nClinton and her team have previously attributed her defeat to the FBI letter, as well as alleged Russian interference. However, Clinton has also given speeches citing a wide range of other reasons for her loss.\n\nIn a speech in New York City on Thursday, Clinton seemed to blame angry voters, stating, \"I think the kind of leadership I was offering was not satisfying enough for certain people, and it wasn't enough for me to say, 'Look, I understand, and here's what I want to do to help' if I didn't display more anger so that they could feel I got their anger.\"\n\nIn the CBS News interview, Clinton also cited Russian interference, the leak of John Podesta's emails by WikiLeaks, alleged voter suppression, and sexism and misogyny as reasons for her loss. She claimed that Facebook took money from Russian companies to run negative stories about her, and that voter suppression was implemented in states like Wisconsin and North Carolina.\n\nClinton also promised a chapter about sexism and misogyny in her upcoming book. More reasons for her election defeat are likely to emerge with the release of \"What Happened.\"\n\nAdam Shaw, a politics reporter based in New York, reported the story.

    " Title: Greta Thunberg and the Progressive Agenda: A Critical Analysis of Individuality and Conformity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent commentary, the pro-life movement has drawn attention to the perceived hypocrisy of progressives, arguing that their focus on climate change overlooks the value of human life before birth. This perspective, as presented, is a critique of the progressive approach to individuality and conformity, using the example of climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nThe article suggests that Thunberg, a 16-year-old climate activist, has been \"groomed\" into her role as a zealot for the progressive cause. It is argued that her Asperger's syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, has facilitated her transformation into a one-note activist. The piece questions the authenticity of the progressive emphasis on individuality and diversity, suggesting that it is a facade for the pursuit of power and control.\n\nThe article further argues that Thunberg's life has been entirely dedicated to the climate cause, mirroring the perceived disregard for individuality in the womb. It suggests that Thunberg's parents have manipulated her condition to serve the ends of the progressive movement. The piece concludes by stating that the progressive model, as represented by Thunberg, encourages conformity, marginalization, and the suppression of individuality.\n\nThe article also touches on the devaluation of human value in modern society, suggesting that education has led to a transactional view of worth, with the price of conformity becoming increasingly steep. The piece concludes by suggesting that the current price for conformity is set at \"Kamikaze mode,\" implying a self-destructive approach to life.\n\nIt is important to note that this article presents a critical perspective on the progressive movement and Greta Thunberg, and readers are encouraged to form their own opinions based on the information provided.

    " Title: U.S. Government Modifies Student Visa Program Due to COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing Wuhan coronavirus pandemic has prompted changes in the way American education is delivered, particularly in secondary and post-secondary schools, colleges, and universities. As a result of the pandemic, educators have had to adapt and teach their lessons online. With the coronavirus pandemic continuing and schools planning for the fall, many are preparing to continue with remote learning. This shift to online classes has led the federal government to reconsider its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) for foreign students planning to study in the United States.\n\nOn Monday, SEVP announced changes to its visa program in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Foreign students will not be allowed to remain in the United States if they are taking a full online course load. If the institution the student is currently attending is conducting all online classes come the fall, the student has the ability to enroll in other schools or programs to meet the in-person requirements.\n\nThe changes apply to F-1 nonimmigrant students, who pursue academic coursework, and M-1 nonimmigrant students, who pursue vocational coursework while studying in the United States.\n\nHere are the guidelines for F-1 and M-1 students:\n\n* Nonimmigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating entirely online may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States. The U.S. Department of State will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will U.S. Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States. Active students currently in the United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status. If not, they may face immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.\n* Nonimmigrant F-1 students attending schools operating under normal in-person classes are bound by existing federal regulations. Eligible F students may take a maximum of one class or three credit hours online.\n* Nonimmigrant F-1 students attending schools adopting a hybrid model\u2014that is, a mixture of online and in-person classes\u2014will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, \u201cCertificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,\u201d certifying that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load this semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program.\n\nThe rule change requires colleges to update their information in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) within 10 days of the start of the fall semester if instruction starts in-person and is then switched to online-only. Students will be responsible for falling into compliance, either by adjusting their courseload or returning home.\n\nAccording to the Institute of International Education, international students make up 5.5 percent of the United States' higher education population. These students are said to have contributed $44.7 billion to the U.S. economy in 2018.",
    " Title: Tariff on Aluminum Imports Could Increase Costs for U.S. Brewers and Consumers\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's proposed 10% tariff on aluminum imports could result in increased production costs for U.S. brewers, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. This is according to a statement by the Beer Institute, a trade group, which claims the tariff would amount to a $347.7 million tax on brewers and result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.\n\nMore than half of the beer produced annually in the U.S. is sold in aluminum containers, traditionally marketed to cost-conscious consumers. Cans of popular beer brands such as Natural Ice and Bud Light are staples among cash-strapped college students and working-class America, a key part of Mr. Trump's political base.\n\nAnalysts suggest that some of these increased costs could be passed on to consumers. Nico von Stackelberg, a consumer-goods analyst at Liberum, stated, \"Businesses don't assume cost increases, they pass them on to consumers.\"\n\nThe tariffs could also impact the craft beer industry, as artisanal brew is increasingly sold in cans due to aluminum's good surface for colorful, effective branding. Industry watchers suggest the planned levies may exacerbate a shift by consumers away from beer toward spirits and wine, which are mainly sold in bottles.\n\nSoda companies, such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, use more aluminum cans than makers of alcoholic beverages, though only about 29% of soda and other soft drinks are sold in cans, according to the American Beverage Association. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo declined to comment.\n\nBrewers are not passively accepting the tariff. MillerCoors, the U.S. division of Molson Coors, tweeted that \"American workers and American consumers will suffer as a result of this misguided tariff,\" adding that there isn't enough can sheet aluminum available in the U.S. to satisfy demand.\n\nAB InBev, the world's largest brewer, was presenting its fourth-quarter earnings on the same day Mr. Trump announced the tariff. AB InBev Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra stated, \"We urge the Department of Commerce and President Trump to consider the adverse impact that the trade restrictions on aluminum will have on the more than two million American jobs before making his final decision.\"\n\nRoughly 25% of AB InBev's cost of goods sold in the U.S. stems from aluminum purchases, according to analysts.\n\nFood manufacturers that rely on steel and aluminum for packaging have also asked the administration to exempt packaging containers from the tariffs. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, the trade group representing big food companies, stated, \"Such tariffs will act as a regressive tax on low income consumers.\"\n\nThe Can Manufacturers Institute, representing can makers, states the tariffs could cause closures to U.S.-based plants. The industry employs 22,000 workers across 34 states in the U.S. The group also argues that domestic metal supplies can't meet its needs, potentially leading to higher food costs for consumers.\n\nIn unveiling his plans to impose the tariffs on aluminum and steel, the president cited what he described as a trade imbalance and national security concerns. However, The Beer Institute argues that imported aluminum used to make beer cans is not a threat to national security. Jim McGreevy, the group's president, stated, \"Imported aluminum used to make beer cans is not a threat to national security.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Government Temporarily Halts Prosecution of Parents Crossing Border Illegally with Children\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The U.S. government has temporarily halted prosecution for parents crossing the border illegally with their children due to a lack of space to house them, according to officials. The Trump administration had vowed to prosecute all adults crossing the border illegally but faced international criticism for its policy of separating immigrant children from parents.\n\nIn an effort to keep detained families together while parents await trial, the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency is not referring new cases for prosecution, CBP officials stated. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the administration was not dropping its \"zero-tolerance\" policy on illegal immigration but needed a \"temporary solution\" until it can house migrant families.\n\nThe U.S. military has been asked to prepare to house up to 20,000 unaccompanied child migrants on its bases. However, the administration has yet to reunite more than 2,000 children with their parents, and it is unclear how it will house thousands of families while parents are prosecuted.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers in Congress, but disagreements between moderates and conservatives over immigration matters have hindered prospects for a speedy legislative fix to the border crisis. Mark Meadows, leader of a conservative faction among Republicans in the House of Representatives, said on Monday he expected an immigration bill being worked on by Republicans to fail.\n\nA group of Republican and Democratic senators met late on Monday to discuss potential legislation establishing a protocol for treating immigrant families as their asylum or other protection from deportation claims are considered. However, after the meeting, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said \"Nothing's going to happen this week\" on legislation in the Senate.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed frustration with U.S. immigration laws and reiterated on Monday that people should be turned away at the border. Democrats have accused him of wanting to circumvent the U.S. constitution's guarantee of due process for those accused of crimes.\n\nThe immigration crisis has triggered new political tension, with Trump lashing out at Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who urged Americans to confront members of his inner circle in public places. Trump called Waters an \"extraordinarily low IQ person.\" Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was confronted at a Mexican restaurant in Washington by protesters.\n\nHouse of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called for cooler heads on both sides, stating, \"Trump's daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable. As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea.\"",
    " Title: Bomb Explosion on Tel Aviv Bus Labeled as Terrorist Attack\n\nArticle: A bomb explosion occurred on a bus in central Tel Aviv on Wednesday, injuring at least 10 individuals in what Israeli officials have described as a terrorist attack. The incident took place on a tree-lined street adjacent to Israel's large defense ministry complex.\n\nAccording to Israel's ambulance service, three of the wounded are in severe condition. The blast shattered the bus's windows. Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, confirmed that this was a terrorist attack.\n\nIsraeli authorities are currently searching the area for the individual who planted the device, and reports indicate that a man has been arrested. The bombing occurred on the eighth day of an Israeli offensive against the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. Celebratory gunfire was heard across the Palestinian enclave following the news of the explosion.\n\nYesterday, Israel expressed skepticism about a truce deal with Hamas, despite the presence of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the country and international efforts to broker a deal. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri praised the bombing but did not claim responsibility.\n\nAbu Zuhri stated, \"Hamas blesses the attack in Tel Aviv and sees it as a natural response to the Israeli massacres... in Gaza.\" He added, \"Palestinian factions will resort to all means in order to protect our Palestinian civilians in the absence of a world effort to stop the Israeli aggression.\"\n\nWith this latest attack, Israel may be more inclined to proceed with a ground invasion of Gaza, a move that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu postponed in hopes of reaching a diplomatic solution first.",
    " Title: Polling Shows Increasing Support for Censorship of Extreme Views in the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll by YouGov reveals growing support among Americans for censorship of extreme and fringe worldviews, causing concern for those who uphold the First Amendment's protection of free speech. The survey, which asked questions about the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), neo-Nazis, ISIS, and Antifa, shows a significant number of respondents in favor of banning these groups from speaking in their communities, having their literature in local libraries, and teaching at local colleges.\n\nAccording to Allahpundit's analysis, the impulse appears to be bipartisan, with only small pluralities of Trump supporters making an \"exception\" for the KKK. Pluralities of Democrats and Republicans agree that neo-Nazis and Klansmen should be subject to bans from speaking in their community (54% of Democrats and 46% of Republicans) and from having their literature carried by the local public library (52% of Democrats and 44% of Republicans). Americans are also roughly evenly split on whether people should be barred by law from joining the Klan (35% in favor, 39% opposed) or the American Nazi Party (38% in favor, 37% opposed).\n\nHowever, there is one demographic that stands out as an outlier in the case of the KKK: \"Narrow pluralities of Trump voters would allow the speech (49% in favor, 39% opposed) and keep the book on the shelves (46% would not remove the book, 39% would),\" according to the poll. This is, of course, the correct position if you support the First Amendment, as the amendment protects vile, ugly speech just as much as prim and proper speech.\n\nThe survey also asked about ISIS. Results show a stronger inclination toward censorship, fueled disproportionately by Republican responses. According to YouGov, GOPers lead Democrats in wanting to remove ISIS books from the library by 14 points. The interpretation of this depends on what one thinks motivates Republicans. To the left, no doubt, it's a sign that conservatives see this issue more starkly when Muslim radicals rather than white radicals are the problem group. However, ISIS is an explicitly murderous terrorist group whose goal is world domination, achieved through brutal violence and subjugation.\n\nThe survey did not poll any explicitly left-wing organizations or movements, such as Antifa. The answer, according to the author, should be straightforward: The speech and political gatherings of communists and hard leftists are absolutely protected, but any criminal conduct is not. That should be the consistently applied standard. Incidentally, does anyone doubt that while self-described Democrats outflank Trump voters on censoring KKK speeches or writings in this poll, the opposite would be true for Antifa?\n\nFor those in the hardcore pro-First Amendment camp, the survey also raises concerns about the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), traditionally a bastion of First Amendment absolutism, starting to go \"wobbly.\" The ACLU is reportedly vulnerable to the currents of American political tribalism. On the flip side, the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on the First Amendment has been consistently and lastingly strong for years.\n\nFinally, the article highlights Megan McArdle's important essay on \"private coercion,\" exploring how outrage mobs, often abetted and fueled by corporate actors, are stamping out controversial opinions and ruining lives, often with little recourse for the target.",
    " Title: Military Sexual Assault Reform: Senate Pursues Significant Changes in Response to High-Profile Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the United States Senate is pursuing significant changes to military law in response to the issue of sexual assault in the military. The changes aim to address concerns about commanders' power in prosecuting sexual assault cases and the impact of unlawful command influence.\n\nA Navy judge ruled this week that two defendants in military sexual assault cases could not be punitively discharged due to President Obama's public remarks in 2013, where he stated that offenders should be \"prosecuted, stripped of their positions, court-martialed, fired, dishonorably discharged. Period.\" This decision was first reported by Stars and Stripes.\n\nEugene R. Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School, commented on the issue, stating, \"Statements by high officials have always been problematic. On the one hand, people do look to them to take a stand on things; on the other hand, we are administering justice here.\"\n\nThe measures in the Senate include a mandatory review of decisions by commanders not to prosecute sexual assault, making retaliation a crime, and subjecting sex offenders to automatic dishonorable discharges. Commanders would also no longer be able to overturn jury convictions unilaterally.\n\nSenator Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine and a co-sponsor of the proposed changes, said, \"What\u2019s been lost in all this is that for the first time ever we are going to have strong legislative changes that are going to make a real difference in curbing sexual assault.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties have been pursuing changes to military law to combat sexual assault for years, but a recent series of events, including startling sexual assault data released by the Defense Department, a spate of high-profile cases, and a handful of lawmakers who have perceived that their pursuit of the issue would be politically advantageous, has put a stronger spotlight on the issue.\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand, who has attached herself to the effort, oversaw the first Senate hearing in nearly a decade on sexual assaults in the military in March. Her efforts received support from several committee members who joined her in pressing members of the military every time they came to the Hill to testify this spring, even if the topic was the defense budget.",
    " Title: Hurricane Dorian Strengthens, Florida Declares State of Emergency\n\nArticle:\n\nHurricane Dorian, currently classified as a Category 1 hurricane, is expected to intensify into a major hurricane by Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). As of 5 a.m. ET on Thursday, the hurricane's maximum sustained winds were 85 mph, with higher gusts. Dorian is approximately 150 miles north-northwest of Puerto Rico, moving at a speed of 13 mph towards the northwest.\n\nThe storm has already impacted Puerto Rico and St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, with sustained winds exceeding 80 mph. Forecasters predict that Dorian will strengthen into a dangerous Category 3 hurricane, defined as sustained winds of at least 111 mph.\n\nHeavy rainfall is expected to affect portions of the Bahamas, Florida, and other areas in the Southeastern United States later this week and into early next week. The NHC stated, \"All indications are that by this Labor Day weekend, a powerful hurricane will be near or over the Florida peninsula.\"\n\nIn response to the approaching hurricane, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for 26 counties potentially in Dorian's path. The Hurricane Warning for Vieques, Culebra, and the U.S. Virgin Islands has been discontinued, and the Hurricane Watch and Tropical Storm Warning for Puerto Rico have been discontinued.\n\nDorian has caused only limited damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Culebra Mayor William Sol\u00eds reported no damages to the AP, with only one community on his island losing power.\n\nCurrent predictions show Dorian's center making landfall on Florida's coast late Sunday or early Monday. The exact location of the eye's landfall is still uncertain, and the NHC advises everyone in the affected area to make emergency preparations.\n\nThe NHC forecasts that the northern Bahamas and coastal sections of the Southeast United States could see 4 to 8 inches of rain, with 10 inches possible in isolated areas. This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods.\n\nPresident Trump has declared an emergency in Puerto Rico, ordering the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide \"equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency.\" Puerto Rico Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced expressed gratitude for the declaration, stating it would \"allow federal aid to arrive more quickly\" after the storm passes.\n\nTrump also approved an emergency declaration for the Virgin Islands on Wednesday. In a statement about its preparations, FEMA stated that its stock on the island compared to 2017 levels includes three times as many generators, nine times as many meals, five times as many liters of water, and 16 times as many blue tarps.\n\nMeanwhile, Tropical Storm Erin formed late Tuesday, with winds reaching 40 mph. The storm, several hundred miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C., was downgraded to a tropical depression on Wednesday. Erin is expected to remain on a north-northeastern track, likely arriving at Canada's coast late this week.",
    " Title: \"Teen Vogue's Transformation into a Political Rage Pamphlet and the Obsession with Celebrity Footwear\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent times, the American culture seems to be evolving into a pervasive default mode of \"All Politics, All The Time.\" This shift is evident in various aspects of society, including the transformation of Teen Vogue, a once-lighthearted magazine, into a politically charged and sometimes alarming platform.\n\nA recent essay in Teen Vogue declared, \"We walk around as if we were bombs about to go off, worried about admitting how livid we really are, even to ourselves.\" The article suggests that women should always be angry and that apathy might indicate underlying issues. Another Teen Vogue writer publicly threatened to bite off male private parts belonging to \"the Evangelicals,\" highlighting the magazine's increasingly aggressive tone.\n\nAnother topic of concern is the obsession with the footwear choices of public figures, particularly first ladies. The recent uproar over Melania Trump wearing high heels during a Hurricane Harvey visit is a prime example. Major media outlets, including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and Politico, published articles criticizing the \"optics\" of her footwear, despite her bringing tennis shoes for her time in Corpus Christi.\n\nEven celebrities, such as Taylor Swift, are not immune to this political creep. A recent New York magazine article labeled Swift as an embodiment of the Trump era, suggesting that the president's presence has given a home to a grim and cynical strain of pop culture.\n\nThis relentless political focus has led to a war on fun, as people seem to find entertainment in political hand-wringing and hectoring. This obsession is not unique to the Trump era, as Michelle Obama faced similar criticism for wearing expensive shoes to a food bank in 2009.\n\nIn conclusion, the culture's encroaching default mode of \"All Politics, All The Time\" is not only exhausting but also cringe-worthy and tedious. It is essential to remember that sometimes, celebrities are just celebrities, and political events do not always require a deep analysis or public outcry. A more balanced approach to politics and entertainment could help preserve the essence of fun in our culture.",
    " Title: Study Finds Partisanship Influences Climate Policy Support Among Democrats and Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent study, which also referenced a similar study, surveyed Democrats, Republicans, and independents in Washington State regarding a carbon tax that was on the ballot in their state in 2016. The study found that participants generally supported climate policies that were perceived as backed by their own party and were neutral toward policies supported by the opposing party.\n\nThe research suggests that Democrats and Republicans are swayed by partisanship because they believe their fellow party members are also heavily influenced by partisanship. This was observed when participants were asked to estimate how their fellow citizens would respond to the policies. People overestimated the opposition of Democrats and Republicans to policies backed by the other side. These exaggerated estimates strongly predicted their own support for a policy.\n\nThis finding aligns with the fundamental lessons of social psychology, which emphasizes that people are profoundly affected by what other people think. In their desire to be upstanding members of their political tribe, people are pulled toward embracing the stances of their peers and are loath to publicly disagree with them.\n\nAs a result, the actual degree of political polarization on climate change belief and support for climate policy is considerably less than people think it is. The study suggests that climate policy gridlock is largely due to exaggerating disagreement for the sake of disagreement.\n\nHowever, there is some cause for optimism. The study revealed a consistent, if somewhat surprising, pattern: Political disagreement was substantially smaller when it came to Republican-backed policies. In particular, there was very little distance between Republicans and Democrats when evaluating a Republican-proposed carbon tax. This suggests that a carbon tax, such as the one proposed by prominent Republicans like James Baker III and George Shultz, may hold more promise for bipartisan agreement than we have seen with Democratic policies in the past.",
    " Title: Croatia Deploys Army to Manage Border Crossings Amidst Refugee Influx\n\nArticle:\n\nCroatia has activated its military forces along the border with Serbia as thousands of refugees and migrants continue to enter the country. The influx follows Hungary's closure of its borders, pushing migrants towards Croatia as an alternative route into European Union (EU) countries.\n\nSpeaking to Lauren Frayer at the Croatia-Serbia border, Jamal al-Shahoud, a refugee from Syria, shared his experience, stating, \"Here, there's no food, no water. No buses, no trains. Nothing here. Just tired.\"\n\nThe situation has led to migrants and refugees streaming into Croatia, with some breaching police lines and running into the countryside. Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic commented, \"What else can we do? You are welcome in Croatia and you can pass through Croatia. But, go on. Not because we don't like you but because this is not your final destination.\"\n\nCroatia has closed highways leading from Serbia, and Hungary has begun constructing a fence on its border with Croatia, in addition to fences along its borders with Serbia and Romania. The new developments come as EU member nations prepare to meet next week to discuss their response to a crisis in which over 440,000 refugees and migrants have reached Europe this year, with more than half coming from Syria, fleeing the country's civil war.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has urged Europe to establish reception centers in Greece, where over 300,000 people have made their first landfall. These centers could register and screen those arriving, according to the U.N. agency. The agency also suggested setting up similar centers in Serbia to register and relocate the new arrivals.\n\nFurthermore, the U.N. agency called for each EU member nation to accept 40,000 refugees, in addition to the voluntary amounts they've already committed.",
    " Title: U.S., European Diplomats Convene in Geneva for Unprecedented Nuclear Talks with Iran\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, along with British, French, and German foreign ministers, have joined nuclear diplomacy talks with Iran in Geneva, marking an unexpected development in the ongoing negotiations to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. This sudden shift follows nearly two years of fruitless discussions.\n\nIran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 today that a joint text is being prepared, but a \"very difficult task\" lies ahead. Zarif stated, \"The only way that we can create confidence and sustain this process is to have balance in the first step, about each side trying to alleviate the most immediate concerns of the other side.\"\n\nU.S. officials aim for an initial deal that would halt the advancement of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for \"very limited\" sanctions relief until a final, more comprehensive agreement is reached, possibly within six months. Iran, on the other hand, seeks a defined endgame that allows for a robust peaceful nuclear program, including uranium enrichment on Iranian soil, and all sanctions lifted.\n\nZarif emphasized the critical nature of the ongoing negotiations, stating, \"This is going to be a critical stage today, and a critical process once we start implementing it.\" He added, \"I believe leaders must show courage and leadership in order to take this process forward.\"\n\nAs the day's events began, European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton's spokesman, Michael Mann, reported that \"intense\" diplomacy was underway to close a deal. The arrival of the three European foreign ministers was also prompted by the news of Kerry's decision to join the talks.\n\nHowever, as hopes for a nuclear deal with Iran grow, so does the opposition from critics. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denounced a potential agreement as a \"historic mistake,\" while hardliners in Iran have vocally opposed any accommodation with the West.\n\nZarif acknowledged the short timeline for all parties involved, but expressed readiness to work as long as necessary to finalize the text. He warned that new U.S. sanctions could deepen mutual mistrust and spark a fierce reaction in Tehran.\n\nIn response to the ongoing negotiations, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has given unprecedented support to Iran's negotiating team, praising them as \"sons of the revolution\" to quell hard-line opposition. Meanwhile, Ayatollah Movahedi Kermani warned that any deal in Geneva would be harmful to Iran.\n\nAs the talks continue, Iran hawks in Congress are moving to speed up fresh sanctions measures, a step that the White House has fought against on Capitol Hill in recent weeks, citing the potential disruption of sensitive talks. Zarif warned that new U.S. sanctions would deepen mutual mistrust and spark a reaction in Tehran.\n\nZarif also highlighted the dismal record of U.S. sanctions, stating, \"Now in 10 years of sanctions and intimidation, what the United States gained, what Congress gained, was 19,000 centrifuges spinning in Tehran. So that's their record, and it's a dismal record.\" He urged American lawmakers to be cautious not to repeat the past mistakes.",
    " Title: Key Moments from the Final GOP Debate Before New Hampshire Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nThe final Republican debate before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary saw several key moments, with candidates taking the stage being one of the first. However, the entrance of Ben Carson proved more complicated than usual. Carson initially refused to walk out to his podium, allowing Ted Cruz to go out first. Donald Trump then stood beside Carson instead of walking out himself, and Jeb Bush walked past them as he took the stage.\n\nAnother notable moment came when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took shots at Sen. Marco Rubio. In a heated exchange, Christie criticized Rubio's pattern of missing votes in the Senate, a criticism that has been a recurring theme in the nomination contest. Rubio, in response, repeatedly used a line attacking President Obama's policies.\n\nMarco Rubio's repeated use of the same line drew attention, with Christie referring to it as a \"memorized 25-second speech.\" Rubio's line was a recurring theme throughout the debate, and Christie called him out on it.\n\nThe debate also saw a discussion on ISIS and foreign policy, during which moderator David Muir asked Sen. Ted Cruz whether waterboarding is torture. Cruz responded that it is not torture under the definition of torture, but he was ambiguous when asked if he would bring the practice back as president.\n\nDonald Trump was more forceful in his response, stating that he would bring back waterboarding and \"a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\" Jeb Bush seemed to rule out the practice, instead suggesting the need to expand intelligence capabilities.\n\nRubio was asked directly if waterboarding is torture, but he did not directly answer the question. Instead, he reiterated that he did not want to give away to the U.S.'s enemies what he would want to do.\n\nTowards the end of the debate, Cruz found himself on the defensive, answering questions about his comments on Donald Trump's temperament and the controversial campaign messages his team sent out on the night of the Iowa caucuses. Cruz apologized to Ben Carson for the incident, with Carson earlier describing it as indicative of Cruz's \"DC values.\"\n\nOverall, the debate saw heated exchanges, repeated lines, and defensive moments, as the candidates vied for votes in the upcoming New Hampshire primary.",
    " Title: Pentagon to Maintain Current Transgender Troop Policy Pending Presidential Direction\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a letter to the military on Thursday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford announced that the Pentagon would not implement a ban on transgender troops until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and implementation guidance has been issued. Until that point, there will be no modifications to the current policy, and the military will continue to treat all personnel with respect.\n\nCurrently, approximately 15,000 transgender troops are serving openly in the United States military. In June of 2016, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that already-serving transgender troops could come out without fear of discharge and established a plan to let openly transgender people enroll in the military within one year. However, on Wednesday morning, President Trump declared on Twitter that \"the United States Government will not accept or allow\" transgender individuals \"to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\" Trump's proclamation raised the real possibility that the thousands of transgender troops in uniform might be purged.\n\nTrump made his announcement without consulting the Pentagon, reportedly not even discussing the issue with his Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, who has strongly supported open transgender service in the past. Trump's sudden decision threatened to jettison years of careful planning and preparation on the part of the military. It also left military leaders in a lurch, caught between the president's tweets and formal policy. The Navy has clarified that, at least for now, transgender troops may still serve and receive transition-related medical care; Dunford's letter makes clear that remains official policy in every branch of the armed forces.\n\nDunford's careful wording indicates real discomfort with Trump's declaration. By writing that \"we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,\" Dunford strongly implies that Trump's policy would entail treating service members with disrespect. His follow-up\u2014\"As importantly, given the current fight and the challenges we face, we will all remain focused on accomplishing our assigned missions\"\u2014suggests that Trump's tweets are a distraction.\n\nThe Pentagon is not defying Trump. However, it is signaling its discomfort, and perhaps even irritation, with his abrupt attack on transgender individuals who simply want to serve their country in uniform. Mattis will soon have to decide whether to escalate this discomfort into concrete pushback.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Unity in Washington: Focus on Foreign Issues Over Domestic Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent article on the Politico website has highlighted a peculiar trend in Washington, D.C.: the seemingly effortless unification of politicians from both parties over foreign issues, while domestic concerns remain unaddressed. The article, titled \"Trump unites the GOP \u2014 against him,\" discusses the ongoing disagreements within the Republican Party regarding President Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria.\n\nThe article points out that the President's decision to disengage from foreign conflicts, including the Syrian civil war, has sparked a wave of opposition from both Democrats and Republicans. This opposition has led to the drafting of bipartisan legislation, a rare occurrence in recent years, as politicians have not been able to achieve such unity for the benefit of American citizens.\n\nOne such bill, reportedly enjoying widespread support in Congress, aims to support the Kurds, a group of people from Syria. The article notes that this bill is said to be \"veto-proof,\" implying that it has garnered such significant support that it would likely bypass a potential presidential veto.\n\nThe article also mentions the lack of similar unity for American soldiers and their needs. For instance, the USMCA trade agreement, which has the support of both parties and thousands of family farmers across the United States, remains stalled due to concerns about President Trump receiving credit for its approval.\n\nThe article concludes with quotes from various politicians expressing concern for the Kurds and the potential consequences of the troop withdrawal. However, it is important to note that the Kurds are not American soldiers, and the conflict in Syria is a civil war, not an American war.\n\nThe article raises questions about the priorities of politicians in Washington, D.C., and the focus on foreign issues over domestic concerns. It is unclear why politicians seem to unite more easily for foreign issues, while issues affecting American citizens, such as the USMCA trade agreement, remain unaddressed.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Gains Access to Ready for Hillary Email List for Fundraising and Organizing\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton's presidential campaign has obtained access to the full Ready for Hillary email list, a significant data resource that is expected to bolster the Democratic front-runner's fundraising and organizing efforts. The campaign gained entry to the independent super PAC's list through a swap with another independent group, according to a Democrat with knowledge of the list. The source declined to identify the other group.\n\nThe list, containing nearly 4 million names, was primarily created by Ready for Hillary over the past two years to serve as a plug-and-play list of supporter names with contact information. For the first six weeks of Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, this data trove was unavailable due to legal reviews regarding the options available to the campaign. The campaign could either trade an old list for the new list or rent \"a la carte\" pieces of the list, such as names of volunteers in Iowa before a campaign stop there. However, the campaign eventually decided it was easier to have access to the entire list.\n\nTracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist who served as a senior adviser to the independent super PAC before it shut down, stated, \"I could offer about 4 million reasons why the Ready for Hillary list is an important resource.\"\n\nTo illustrate the importance of the list, consider the recent experience of Lynette Hull, a 17-year-old high school student from Las Vegas who was one of the first interns to sign up with the campaign after Clinton announced her presidential bid. Hull was tasked with phone-banking, working through an old database of Clinton supporters to sign up new volunteers. However, she found the work time-consuming and unproductive, with many contacts either not answering or being too old to volunteer.\n\nThere is some overlap between the Ready for Hillary list and the campaign's own list of supporters. When Clinton officially announced her presidential bid six weeks ago, Ready For Hillary emailed its list six times, encouraging them to sign up with the official campaign. Clinton staffers have also been signing up new supporters in the early states on their own. A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment for this report.",
    " Title: San Francisco's Ongoing Debate on Bans and Subsidies: A Look at Recent Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nSan Francisco, a progressive city known for its tech industry and environmental initiatives, has been in the news recently for its controversial policies on banning certain items and subsidizing others.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, two San Francisco supervisors proposed a ban on company cafeterias offering free food and drink to employees. This proposal aims to support local restaurants that are reportedly losing business due to in-house dining options provided by tech companies. The city's tech community is known for its large, trendy cafeterias, which offer employees a convenient dining option while they work.\n\nIn a different context, San Francisco made headlines for its ban on plastic straws, joining a list of other progressive cities such as Seattle, Malibu, Santa Cruz, and Santa Barbara. The city's ban on straws is part of an effort to reduce plastic waste in the ocean. However, critics argue that plastic straws account for a small percentage of ocean waste and that the ban may have unintended consequences, such as increased use of other plastic products.\n\nAnother significant policy change in San Francisco involves the city's supervisors urging the city to screen insurers for their investments in coal and tar sands. This resolution, if implemented, would make San Francisco the first U.S. municipal body to force insurance companies to stop insuring and investing in fossil fuels.\n\nThese policies highlight the ongoing debate in San Francisco and other progressive cities about the role of government in regulating businesses and addressing environmental concerns. The city's approach to electric bicycles, cafeterias, plastic straws, and fossil fuel investments demonstrates the complexity and unpredictability of the \"ban it or subsidize it\" game that cities play in response to various social and environmental issues.",
    " Title: White House Argues Non-Compliance with Impeachment Inquiry Without House Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nFox News senior judicial analyst and Fox Nation host Judge Andrew Napolitano has backed the legal argument behind a White House letter expected to be sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arguing that the White House does not have to comply with the Democrats' impeachment inquiry without a formal vote from the House of Representatives. The letter, which may be sent as early as Friday, reportedly dares Pelosi to put the question of a formal impeachment inquiry before the House for a vote.\n\nOn Sept. 24, Pelosi announced that House Democrats would undertake the probe without asking for the support of the members of the House. Wall Street Journal Editorial Page Editorial Board member Bill McGurn explored the issue on Fox Nation's \"Deep Dive,\" stating, \"If we're hearing how serious impeachment is\u2014what does it say for Mrs. Pelosi to do this in a way that's without precedent? It's just a decree on her part.\"\n\nHowever, Pelosi's decision carries other serious implications, as explained by Judge Napolitano, host of Fox Nation's \"Liberty File with Judge Napolitano.\" The White House letter will argue that the White House is not required to comply with the Democrats' investigation because Pelosi has not codified the probe with a formal vote on the House floor.\n\nJudge Napolitano's remarks were recorded before Fox News confirmed that the White House planned to send this letter, but his legal analysis finds that the White House's argument has merit. He explained that Speaker Pelosi is not required to put the question of an impeachment inquiry up for a vote, but if she did, and if it was approved by a majority of House members, then her inquiry would be strengthened.\n\n\"Mrs. Pelosi is correct that the Constitution does not require a full House vote, before the House begins an impeachment inquiry, but when it does so\u2026 without the full House vote it does so based on federal law\u2026 that authority comes from statutes, not the Constitution. That's very significant. When an authority comes from a statute, there are other statutes that can contradict it,\" the judge said.\n\nHe further explained that if Pelosi put the question of an impeachment inquiry up for a vote and a majority of House members approve it, that changes the game. \"If\u2026 the House of Representatives voted by majority vote to proceed with an impeachment inquiry, that changes the rules all together. There are no privileges because the House's right to impeach comes from the Constitution and the Constitution trumps\u2026 any statute that would interfere with it.\"\n\nIn the latest episode of \"Liberty File with Judge Napolitano,\" the judge spoke with two Republicans mounting presidential primary challenges against President Trump in 2020. The judge asked them what they make of Democrats' allegations that the president violated his oath of office by asking the president of Ukraine to investigate his political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld said he agrees with the president's critics. \"The conduct that the president has engaged in is precisely the sort of conduct that the Framers were worried about and why they put the impeachment and removal power in the hands of Congress. They were worried about, number one, foreign interference... In the Oval Office, the president said that he doesn't care as much about the interference in the 2016 election, that 'everybody does it.' There couldn't be a more clear instance of inviting foreign interference. And of course, the Ukraine call goes right into the same thing.\"\n\nTo see more of Judge Napolitano's analysis and the full episode of the latest edition of \"Liberty File with Judge Napolitano,\" go to Fox Nation and sign up today.

    " Title: Jussie Smollett Files Counterclaim Against Chicago, Police, and Brothers Involved in Alleged Hate Crime\n\nArticle:\n\nActor Jussie Smollett has filed a counterclaim against the city of Chicago, multiple police officers, two brothers, and the Chicago Police Department in response to a lawsuit filed by the city seeking to recover $130,106 from an investigation into a purported hate crime that occurred in late January.\n\nSmollett, who was initially charged with 16 counts of making false statements to police, pleaded not guilty to the charges and maintained that he was a victim of a racist and homophobic attack. However, the city later determined that the alleged attack was a hoax.\n\nSmollett's counterclaim, reported by the Chicago Sun-Times, alleges \"malicious prosecution\" and claims that the actor suffered \"humiliation, mental anguish, and extreme emotional distress\" as a result. The counterclaim was filed in response to the city's lawsuit, which was filed in August. At that time, Smollett requested that the city's lawsuit be thrown out, stating that he could not have known what the police investigation would cost.\n\nAs of August, Smollett's team still insisted that it had evidence that the hate crime hoax was real. The counterclaim names the city, the Chicago Police Department, Detectives Michael Theis and Edward Wodnicki, Supt. Eddie Johnson, and the two brothers involved in the alleged attack, Abimiola and Olabinjo Osundairo.\n\nThe counterclaim states that the proceedings against Smollett were terminated in his favor and \"in a manner which indicates his innocence because all 16 counts of the criminal indictment were dismissed two and a half weeks after the indictment was filed.\" The claim also insists that the city of Chicago cannot recover investigation costs from Smollett because it already accepted the $10,000 fine from him \"as payment in full in connection with the dismissal of the charges against him.\"\n\nFurther details about the case and its background can be found here.",
    " Title: Google, Facebook, and Twitter Accused of Discrimination and Censorship Against Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nA class-action lawsuit filed by former Google engineer James Damore and other right-of-center Google employees alleges a culture of censorship and discrimination within the tech giant. The lawsuit claims that Google illegally discriminates against white male employees as part of the company's diversity efforts, with managers openly discussing blacklists to sabotage promotions, performance reviews, and employment opportunities for those with conservative viewpoints.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in 2018, states that Google employees are pressured to undergo one-sided \"Bias Busting\" re-education sessions focusing on white male privilege, and employees risk their careers by speaking out against progressive orthodoxy. Internal messages included in the lawsuit reveal employees openly conspiring against Damore after he shared a memo criticizing the company's diversity policies and calling for more tolerance of conservative viewpoints.\n\nGoogle's new fact-checkers, as revealed by The Daily Caller on Tuesday, are reportedly almost exclusively devoted to policing right-of-center media outlets, with the company allegedly wrongfully attributing false statements to TheDC. Left-of-center outlets received no such policing from Google, which has previously censored content that doesn't align with its political goals.\n\nThe lawsuit is not the only instance of alleged discrimination and censorship against conservatives in the tech industry. Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube (which is owned by Google) have all exhibited similar patterns of behavior. Facebook regularly buried conservative viewpoints from its trending topics section, several former employees told Gizmodo. YouTube and Google have targeted conservative and independent video channels for censorship and demonetization. Both Facebook and Google empowered left-wing fact-checkers to discredit conservative voices on behalf of the companies, with little oversight. Twitter buried tweets damaging to the Clinton campaign and censors conservatives but allowed racist death threats against Trump FCC chairman Ajit Pai.\n\nConservatives face discrimination, censorship, and even violence when left-wing authoritarians run a college campus. But what happens when left-wing authoritarians run the most powerful companies in the world? The lawsuit against Google is ongoing, and the tech industry's handling of conservative viewpoints remains a contentious issue.",
    " Title: TSA Faces Security Failures at Major U.S. Airports as Undercover Tests Reveal 95% Success Rate for Mock Explosives and Banned Weapons\n\nArticle:\n\nAn internal investigation by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has uncovered security lapses at numerous major U.S. airports, with undercover investigators successfully smuggling mock explosives or prohibited weapons through security checkpoints in 95% of trials, according to a report by \u2588\u2588\u2588. The tests were conducted by Homeland Security Red Teams, who pose as passengers with the intention of bypassing security measures.\n\nAccording to sources briefed on the results of a recent Homeland Security Inspector General's report, TSA agents failed 67 out of 70 tests, allowing Red Team members to surreptitiously transport potential weapons through checkpoints. In one instance, an undercover agent triggered a magnetometer alarm but was not detected after a follow-on pat-down, despite a concealed fake explosive device taped to their back.\n\nThe exact timeframe for the testing has not been disclosed, other than it concluded recently. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson reportedly sought a detailed briefing on the findings last week at TSA headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. U.S. officials have stated that changes have already been implemented at airports to address the identified vulnerabilities.\n\n\"Upon learning the initial findings of the Office of Inspector General's report, Secretary Johnson immediately directed TSA to implement a series of actions, several of which are now in place, to address the issues raised in the report,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in a written statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nHomeland security officials maintain that security at the nation's airports remains strong, with multiple layers of security including bomb-sniffing dogs and various technologies. However, the officials who spoke to \u2588\u2588\u2588 acknowledged the disappointing results of the latest tests.\n\nThis is not the first time the TSA has struggled to detect Red Team agents. A similar incident occurred in 2013, when an undercover investigator with a fake bomb concealed on their person passed through a metal detector, underwent a pat-down at New Jersey's Newark Liberty Airport, and was never apprehended.\n\nAt the time, the TSA stated that Red Team tests took place weekly across the United States and were designed to \"push the boundaries of our people, processes, and technology.\" In a 2013 blog post, a TSA official wrote, \"Our testers often make these covert tests as difficult as possible.\"\n\nIn a 2013 hearing on Capitol Hill, then-TSA administrator John Pistole described the Red Team as \"super terrorists,\" who are adept at exploiting the TSA's weaknesses. \"Testers know exactly what our protocols are. They can create and devise and conceal items that... not even the best terrorists would be able to do,\" Pistole told lawmakers at a House hearing.\n\nMore recently, the DHS inspector general's office completed a series of undercover tests targeting checked baggage screening at airports nationwide. That review found \"vulnerabilities\" throughout the system, attributing them to human error and technological failures, according to a three-paragraph summary of the review released in September. Additionally, the review determined that despite spending $540 million on checked baggage screening equipment and an additional $11 million for training since a previous review in 2009, the TSA failed to make any noticeable improvements in that time.",
    " Title: Twitter Agrees to Remove Racist Tweets in Response to French Legal Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Twitter has agreed to remove racist and hateful tweets following a threat of legal action from a French organization. The social media giant has historically resisted efforts to police its content, but hate speech is illegal in many European countries, and anti-hate groups there are grappling with how to deal with the challenge of social media.\n\nThe incident that led to this decision began on October 10, when a hashtag #unbonjuif, or \"a good Jew,\" prompted a flood of anti-Semitic tweets. The influx of hateful messages continued for several days.\n\nElie Petit, Vice President of the French Union of Jewish Students, explains the situation from the Paris office. He demonstrates how it all started on October 10. The tweets, he says, were not \"abuse content\" as Twitter claimed, but rather calls for the murder of Jews, which is a crime in France.\n\nMany European countries have strict laws against hate speech targeted at specific groups. These laws evolved in the aftermath of the Holocaust, a result of years of Nazi hate propaganda.\n\nOn a conference call with Twitter executives in California, Petit and his colleagues tried to explain the French perspective, but they claim Twitter refused to delete the tweets, insisting that such demands must come from national authorities or police. The Jewish students prepared to file a lawsuit, but on Friday, Twitter reversed its decision, agreeing to erase the offensive tweets.\n\nManuel Diaz, whose company, Emakina, advises corporations on how to adapt to the digital era, comments on the situation. He is adamantly against controls on free speech, but he argues that, given Twitter's global status, it must take responsibility for its content.\n\n\"The content spread through Twitter has to respect the different local laws of the different countries where they are accessible,\" Diaz says. This, he notes, is not an easy task for a global company.\n\nTwitter's decision in France came a day after the company complied with German law and blocked an account of a neo-Nazi group. However, digital expert Diaz argues that Twitter must react even faster if it wants to succeed in the international media market.\n\n\"Waiting for the French state or the French police department to do something, well, the buzz is already out and it's too late,\" he says. \"If they are not able to monitor a buzz and take some decisions very quickly, I would be very disappointed.\"\n\nDiaz expresses his disappointment in what he considers the best real-time media tool in the world. He suggests that Twitter should not censor but should build global monitoring teams to make quick decisions in cases like the French one. If Twitter can detect and quickly suspend fake accounts, as it has done in the past, then it can easily suspend tweets that do not respect local laws.",
    " Title: Arrested Man Admits No Intention to Harm in Pizzeria Incident, Believes in \"Pizzagate\" Conspiracy\n\nArticle:\n\nEdgar Welch, the man arrested on Sunday for discharging a military-style rifle inside the Washington, D.C. pizzeria Comet Ping Pong, told The New York Times via video chat on Wednesday that he drove up from North Carolina to investigate the restaurant due to its association with the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory. Welch, a 28-year-old father of two, stated that he had no intention of firing a shot and expressed regret for his actions.\n\nWelch claimed that he was led to believe that Comet Ping Pong was the center of a child sex ring run by associates of Hillary Clinton, but admitted that the information he received was not 100% accurate. He stated that just because no children were found inside the pizzeria, it does not mean that the \"Pizzagate\" pedophile ring does not exist.\n\nWelch acknowledged that he does not believe in conspiracy theories but listens to Alex Jones, who regularly spreads conspiracy theories on his radio show and websites. He described Jones as \"a bit eccentric\" and noted that while Jones touches on some viable issues, he goes off the deep end on some things.\n\nThe \"Pizzagate\" myth, built through creative interpretations of emails hacked from John Podesta and released by WikiLeaks to harm Clinton's presidential campaign, is spreading beyond Washington, D.C., and has even reached Austin, Texas, where the pizzeria East Side Pies has become embroiled in the false story.\n\nThe owners of East Side Pies became aware of \"Pizzagate\" through strange comments on the restaurant's Facebook page, then were pointed to Reddit threads linking their pizzeria to the fake story. The Austin American-Statesman's Matthew Odam outlines several of the red herrings in the online posts, including wild and baseless accusations about East Side Pies, interpretations of the restaurant's logo as a symbol of the \"Illuminati,\" questions about photos of pizza-eating children on East Side Pies' Facebook account, inferences that a picture of staffers with former Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell was proof of nefarious political ties, and claims that co-owner Michael Freid, an alumnus of the Culinary Institute of America, had \"connections to the CIA.\"\n\nOwen Shroyer, who makes videos for Alex Jones' Infowars and hosts his own podcast, posted a 2.5-hour video detailing his own investigation of East Side Pies on Saturday. Austin police and the FBI are currently investigating the threats and vandalism of a pizza delivery truck.",
    " Title: Trump Voters Remain Loyal Despite Media Criticism and Political Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's voters remain steadfast in their support for the president, despite criticism from the national media, neighbors, and political opposition. These voters attribute their continued support to their frustration with the resistance from Democrats and the stalled Trump agenda due to internal squabbles within the Republican party.\n\nKevin Madden, a Republican Party strategist, attributes this loyalty to the belief that their support for Trump is yet to be validated and that it can still yield positive results. Trump voters express less trust in the media, political elites, and other institutions that question their decision, compared to their trust in President Trump himself.\n\nPolls, including those released around the 100-day mark of his presidency, have consistently found that stories of Trump voters abandoning their support are rare. Instead, most Trump supporters view him as a powerful leader and celebrate his crusade against political correctness and his combative approach to the news media.\n\nTrump voters have forgiven him for backing off some campaign promises, attributing it to his learning curve as a political novice. A Fox News survey showed 97 percent of Trump backers remained satisfied with their vote, while 2 percent wished they had voted differently. A Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 96 percent of Trump voters said supporting him was the right decision, and 2 percent regretted their choice.\n\nA University of Virginia Center for Politics and Public Opinion Strategies poll showed 93 percent of Trump's backers approved of the job he was doing, compared to 52 percent for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and 28 percent for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\"They are more loyal [to Trump] than they are to the GOP, but they are still anti-Democrat and much more inclined to support the GOP,\" said Glen Bolger of Public Opinion Strategies. \"There are not a whole lot of Trump voters who say, 'I am ready to defect.' That is not to say that a year from now things might be different.\"\n\nCable news networks have focused on finding Trump voters who may have fallen off the bandwagon, running stories about those who could potentially suffer under the work-in-progress healthcare bill or from his proposed budget cuts. However, this relentless negative focus is met with derision by Trump loyalists who loathe the press.\n\nThe University of Virginia survey found 88 percent of respondents agreed with Trump's assertion that the press is \"the enemy of the American people.\" The Washington Post/ABC News poll showed that 8 in 10 Trump supporters believed news organizations regularly publish false stories.\n\nOverall, Trump's approval rating is underwater, as the White House grapples with accusations of campaign operatives having ties to Russian officials and the recent firing of FBI Director James B. Comey, which has ignited calls for Trump's impeachment.\n\nDemocrats hope that the anti-Trump wave, coupled with Trump defections, could help them make significant gains in congressional elections next year. However, so far, anti-Trump sentiment has failed to yield results at the polls. Republicans have won two special congressional elections to maintain Republican-held districts, with the Republican candidates winning by considerably less than the double-digit margins Trump himself achieved in those districts.\n\n\"I haven't seen any evidence that his core support has faded,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. \"What may be more important is whether the opposition is hardening. In other words, are folks who have been saying that Trump is not really doing a great job shifting to the view that he is actually being harmful?\"",
    " Title: Democratic Party Faces Continuing Rift as Sanders Leads in Iowa Caucuses\n\nThe Democratic Party is currently experiencing a rift between its moderate and progressive wings, with criticism directed towards Iowa's use of caucuses. In the ongoing Iowa caucuses, as of the reported results, Senator Bernie Sanders leads in the popular vote with 26.3%, followed by former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Vice President Joe Biden, and Senator Amy Klobuchar.\n\nSanders' lead in the popular vote is not due to support from entrenched party powers or institutional backing, but rather, he has managed to secure the lead despite lacking traditional electoral success mainstays and facing a wave of establishment attacks. The results have been less favorable for Biden, who is now facing doubts about his campaign's weak organizing effort in Iowa.\n\nMayor Buttigieg, who is currently in fourth place, has been a surprise contender in Iowa, and while he has a real chance of finishing first, his ability to expand his support across the country, particularly among minority voters, remains uncertain. This could impact his chances of winning the nomination.\n\nThe preliminary results from Iowa show a relatively even split between the party's progressive and moderate wings, with Sanders, Warren, and Yang accumulating 51,821 votes, while Biden, Buttigieg, and Klobuchar have 54,894 votes combined. These numbers suggest a protracted and competitive primary that could potentially lead to a contested convention.\n\nThe ongoing Iowa caucuses have sparked discussions about reform, with some calling for Iowa to switch from a caucus to a primary system. Critics argue that the current caucus system is complex, time-consuming, and not representative of the entire electorate. Some have also called for ending Iowa's first-in-the-nation status, citing the state's small population and perceived inability to manage the process effectively.\n\nA former Democratic congressman from Iowa, however, defends the Iowa caucuses, arguing that they provide an opportunity for real voters to assess the candidates and that the state's politics are open, honest, and not governed by a kingmaker. The congressman also highlights Iowa's history of rewarding diverse candidates, such as a black American, a woman, and an openly gay former mayor.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses will continue to unfold, and the results could have significant implications for the Democratic Party and the 2020 presidential race. The rest of the primary season, including the New Hampshire and Nevada primaries, will provide further insight into the candidates' abilities to appeal to a broader electorate and secure the Democratic nomination.",
    " Title: Obama Criticizes Romney-Ryan Medicare Plan, Citing Harvard Professor's Study\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama renewed his criticism of the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan on Sunday, citing a study by Harvard professor David Cutler that suggests increased costs for future Medicare recipients and higher insurance company profits. The attack comes after the release of a disappointing August unemployment report last week.\n\nAt a rally in Melbourne, Florida, Obama stated, \"Your costs would rise by the thousands, and the insurance companies' profits would rise by the billions.\" He also accused the plan by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, of increasing insurance profits by $16 billion to $20 billion and of not supporting their plan to transform Medicare into a voucher system.\n\nThe president did not specify the source of the numbers, but senior campaign officials attributed them to Cutler's study. Cutler, a Harvard professor and health policy expert who served in the Clinton administration and was Obama's top health care adviser during the 2008 presidential campaign, conducted the study for the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund.\n\nThe Romney campaign responded by labeling Cutler an \"Obamacare drafter\" and stating that the president's attacks this weekend were a sign of desperation. Campaign spokesman Ryan Williams said, \"Only one candidate in this race has robbed today's Medicare of $716 billion to pay for Obamacare \u2013 Barack Obama.\"\n\nRomney's plan aims to control Medicare costs by providing retirees with voucher-like government payments that can be used to purchase either traditional Medicare or private health insurance. However, Cutler argues that older Americans would have to pay more out-of-pocket to cover rising healthcare costs under this plan.\n\nObama's aides believe they have forced Romney to shift his focus from the sluggish economy following Ryan's selection as the running mate. Romney and Ryan have countered by arguing that Obama planned to cut hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicare spending over 10 years to fund his healthcare plan.\n\nThe political impact of this debate is unclear. However, Republican analysts suggest that Romney's focus on Medicare has diverted attention from the economy, which they consider crucial for his election chances, especially after a weak jobs report showing limited job growth and more unemployed people choosing not to seek work.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, campaigning in Ohio on Saturday, referred to the Romney-Ryan plan as \"Vouchercare.\" Biden said the plan would require \"Mom\" to find the best insurance deal in the market, with the possibility of needing to borrow money to cover costs exceeding the voucher amount.\n\nMuch of Cutler's data is based on studies by the independent Congressional Budget Office, which has projected even higher costs for future retirees under a 2011 budget plan written by Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee. The budget agency stated that, by 2030, a typical 65-year-old would be paying two-thirds of their health costs.\n\nRomney and Ryan are currently off the campaign trail, but both taped appearances for Sunday talk shows.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Engage in Comedy Routine at New York Charity Event\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from the contentious political debates, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney participated in a comedy routine at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York on Thursday. The event, organized by the Catholic Archdiocese of New York to benefit needy children, followed the presidential contenders' debate at Hofstra University two days prior.\n\nDuring the light-hearted event, the candidates exchanged humorous jabs on topics such as the deficit, media bias, Romney's wealth, and Big Bird. The evening served as a respite from the bruising campaign, with the event expected to raise $5 million for Catholic charities.\n\nRomney, a teetotaling Mormon, joked about the media's portrayal of his campaign, stating, \"People seem to be very curious about how to prepare \u2014 first refrain from alcohol for 65 years, then get the biggest straw man and mercilessly attack it.\" He also made light of the controversy surrounding his statement to cut funding for public broadcasting, saying, \"Big Bird did not even see it coming.\"\n\nObama poked fun at his own performance in the first debate, which took place on his and first lady Michelle Obama's 20th anniversary. He joked, \"I particularly want to apologize to Chris Matthews. Four years ago, [he] gave him a thrill up his leg; this time I gave him a stroke.\"\n\nThe candidates also took jabs at their respective running mates, with Romney making light of Vice President Joe Biden's performance in his debate against Paul Ryan, stating, \"I was hoping Biden would be along, because he'll laugh at anything.\"\n\nRomney, dressed in a tuxedo, commented on the formality of the event, saying, \"It's nice to finally relax and wear what Ann and I wear around the house.\" He also made a jab at Obama, saying, \"You have to wonder what he's thinking. So little time, so much to redistribute.\"\n\nObama, in turn, took a jab at Romney's wealth, stating, \"Earlier today I went shopping at some stores in Midtown. I understand Governor Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown.\"\n\nThe candidates will resume their debates on Monday in South Florida for their third and final debate, with the focus on foreign policy. The event was overseen by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.",
    " Title: Americans' Skepticism Towards Government Intervention, Yet Dependence in Times of Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nAmericans, in general, exhibit a skepticism towards excessive government intervention, with a majority preferring less government involvement, according to Gallup's three-decade-long data. However, this skepticism wanes during national crises, as people increasingly rely on the government to address issues that individuals and private industries cannot handle.\n\nCurrently, the number of Americans desiring government intervention to solve the country's problems is almost on par with those who believe the government is already doing too much. This is one of those times when government intervention is crucial, as it fills the gaps left by individuals and private sectors during hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, economic, and health crises.\n\nPresident Trump has faced criticism for his handling of information regarding the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. In an attempt to mitigate potential panic and fear, Trump initially downplayed the severity of the virus, and his messages have been inconsistent. This has led to a lack of trust in his statements about the coronavirus, according to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.\n\nConversely, Americans trust the information provided by their local officials and government health experts regarding the virus. The White House press briefings were absent over the weekend, with Trump tweeting that they are not worth the time and effort. A briefing scheduled for Monday evening was later removed from the White House schedule.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump's efforts to withhold funding from the World Health Organization and other reported steps to sideline the global health agency. Meanwhile, two former federal health officials are spearheading a call for a $46 billion public health investment in the next coronavirus aid package to safely reopen the economy.\n\nResearchers suggest that one standard for safely easing social distancing measures is 1 new infection per million people in a given state. They estimate that states adhering to this level of transmission should be able to control outbreaks even after people start mingling again, though they stress that large gatherings should still be limited.\n\nThe World Health Organization stated that there is currently no evidence that recovered COVID-19 patients are immune to a second infection. New York City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reported an uptick in poison control calls following Trump's disinfectant comments, with 30 cases in an 18-hour period compared to 13 cases during the same time frame last year.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic dominates the political conversation, Americans' ambivalence towards science and experts is likely to come to the forefront.",
    " Title: American Jewish Congregations Divided Over United Nations' Palestine Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of American Jewish congregations, including those from different branches of Judaism, have expressed varying opinions regarding the United Nations' recent vote recognizing Palestine as a non-member observer state. While some congregants have praised the move as a bold and courageous stand, others have expressed shock and dismay over the public expression of support for Palestine.\n\nGil Kulick, a congregant, commended the congregations for their strong and unequivocal stance, stating, \"I thought it was very courageous of them. I think, as of late, there has been a reluctance to speak out on this issue, and that's why I was really delighted that they chose to take a strong stand.\"\n\nHowever, Eve Birnbaum, a member of a congregation for about 15 years, expressed her dismay over the rabbis' e-mail, stating, \"I am very dismayed, as a longstanding member of the synagogue, that the rabbis and the board would take a position that is contrary to what many members believe, contrary to the peace process.\"\n\nThe rabbis at B'nai Jeshurun, a synagogue in New York City, did not respond to requests for comment on the e-mail. The gist of the e-mail, which expressed cautious optimism about Palestine's new status and the potential for a two-state solution, was not surprising to congregants, but its tone and timing were jarring to some.\n\nThe debate over the United Nations' Palestine vote and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been a long-standing and often contentious issue within the American Jewish community. Samuel Norich, the publisher of The Forward, a Jewish affairs weekly based in New York, stated, \"At most times we impose a kind of discipline upon ourselves\u2014nobody imposes it on us\u2014particularly on a matter that the Israeli government has asked for unanimous support from the Jewish community.\"\n\nThe rabbis' e-mail is not the only instance of public criticism of Israeli government policies within the American Jewish community. Rabbi Sharon Brous of Los Angeles sent an e-mail to her congregants during the Gaza conflict stating, \"The Palestinian people are also children of God, whose suffering is real and undeniable.\" This statement was met with criticism from Rabbi Daniel Gordis, who attacked the sentiment in a column for The Times of Israel.\n\nThe debate over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the appropriate level of criticism of Israeli government policies within the American Jewish community continues to be a contentious issue. Rabbi David Ingber of Romemu, another liberal synagogue on the Upper West Side, stated, \"This is the constant question among liberal, progressive Jews: what does it mean to support Israel? Does it mean never criticizing Israel?\"",
    " Title: Charleston Church Shooting Suspect Identified as Dylann Roof, Former Friend Says He Was Avowed Racist\n\nArticle:\n\nA former friend who reconnected with the man accused of the shooting massacre at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, said Dylann Roof had become an avowed racist. Joey Meek reconnected with Roof a few weeks ago and said that while they got drunk together on vodka, Roof began complaining that \"blacks were taking over the world\" and that \"someone needed to do something about it for the white race.\"\n\nRoof, 21, is accused of fatally shooting nine people during a Bible study at The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston on Wednesday night, ripping out a piece of South Carolina's civic heart and adding to the ever-growing list of America's racial casualties. Police in Charleston charged Roof with nine counts of murder as well as possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.\n\nMeek called the FBI after recognizing Roof in the surveillance footage, down to the stained sweatshirt he wore while playing Xbox videogames in Meek's home the morning of the attack. \"I didn't think it was him. I knew it was him,\" Meek told The Associated Press after being interviewed by investigators.\n\nAccording to a CBS News report, a classmate reportedly described Roof as a \"pill popper\" who \"told racist jokes.\" Those who knew Roof say they remember him talking about a scheme, fueled by his segregationist ideals. Meek said Roof told him he wanted \"to start a civil war.\"\n\nMeek said during their reunion a few weeks ago, Roof told him that he had used birthday money from his parents to buy a.45-caliber Glock pistol and that he had \"a plan\" that was six months in the making. He did not say what the plan was, but Meek said it scared him enough that he took the gun out of Roof's car and hid it in his house until the next day.\n\nRoof made incriminating statements indicating he was involved in the shooting, according to unnamed sources. Police captured Roof in Shelby, North Carolina, after a motorist spotted him at a traffic light on her way to work. His apprehension ended an intense, hours-long manhunt.\n\nRoof waived extradition and was back in Charleston on Thursday night, authorities said, with a bond hearing pending. On Friday, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley told NBC's \"Today\" show the shooter should get the death penalty. \"We will absolutely want him to have the death penalty,\" Haley said.\n\nCharleston officials announced a prayer vigil for Friday evening. The city's mayor described the shooting at the church as an act of \"pure, pure concentrated evil.\" The victims included a state senator who doubled as the church's minister, three other pastors, a regional library manager, a high school coach and speech therapist, a government administrator, a college enrollment counselor, and a recent college graduate - six women and three men who felt called to open their church to all.\n\nPresident Barack Obama called the tragedy yet another example of damage wreaked in America by guns. NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks said, \"There is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people.\" Others bemoaned the loss to a church that has served as a bastion of black power for 200 years, despite efforts by white supremacists to wipe it out.\n\n\"Of all cities, in Charleston, to have a horrible, hateful person go into the church and kill people there to pray and worship with each other is something that is beyond any comprehension and is not explained,\" said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. \"We are going to put our arms around that church and that church family.\"\n\nGov. Haley: After S.C. church shooting suspect was in custody, community could start to heal\n\nSurveillance video showed the gunman entering the church Wednesday night, and a Snapchat video reportedly taken by one of the few survivors of the attack shows a small group of people gathered together inside the church. All of them are black except for one man.\n\nCharleston County Coroner Rae Wilson said he initially did not appear threatening. \"The suspect entered the group and was accepted by them, as they believed that he wanted to join them in this Bible study,\" she said. Then, \"he became very aggressive and violent.\"\n\nIt's not clear whether Roof had any connection to the 16 white supremacist organizations operating in South Carolina, but he appears to be a \"disaffected white supremacist,\" based on his Facebook page, said Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nOn his Facebook page, Roof displayed the flags of defeated white-ruled regimes, posing with a Confederate flags plate on his car and wearing a jacket with stitched-on flag patches from apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia, which is now black-led Zimbabwe.\n\nRoof was arrested in February at a mall in Columbia, South Carolina - charged with felony drug possession. He was wearing all black and suspicious employees called police. They found Roof with strips of the drug suboxone - often abused, but typically used to treat opiate addiction. The mall banned him from the premises but he was arrested for trespassing there in April.\n\nSpilling blood inside a black church - especially \"Mother Emanuel,\" founded in 1816 - evoked painful memories nationwide, a reminder that black churches so often have been the targets of racist violence. A church founder, Denmark Vesey, was hanged after trying to organize a slave revolt in 1822, and white landowners burned the church in revenge, leaving parishioners to worship underground until after the Civil War. The congregation rebuilt and grew stronger, eventually winning campaigns for voting rights and political representation.\n\nIts lead pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney - among the dead - recalled his church's history in a 2013 sermon, saying \"we do not see ourselves as just a place where we come to worship, but as a beacon and as a bearer of the culture.\"\n\n\"What the church is all about,\" Pinckney said, \"is the 'freedom to be fully what God intends us to be and have equality in the sight of God. And sometimes you got to make noise to do that. Sometimes you may have to die like Denmark Vesey to do that.'\"\n\nPinckney, 41, was a married father of two and a Democrat who spent 19 years in the South Carolina legislature after he was first elected at 23, becoming the youngest member of the House. The other victims were Cynthia Hurd, 54; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Myra Thompson, 59; Ethel Lance, 70; Susie Jackson, 87; and the reverends DePayne Middleton Doctor, 49; Sharonda Singleton, 45; and Daniel Simmons Sr., 74.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the attack would be investigated as a hate crime.",
    " Title: FCC Proposes to Repeal Net Neutrality Rules, Shifting Digital Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced plans on Tuesday to repeal landmark 2015 rules known as net neutrality, a move that could reshape the digital landscape. The proposal, led by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, is set to be voted on at a Dec. 14 meeting.\n\nThe net neutrality rules, championed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, prohibited internet service providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content. The rules aimed to ensure a free and open internet, give consumers equal access to web content, and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content.\n\nThe repeal of these rules would grant internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp, and Verizon Communications Inc sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can access and at what price. This move is a victory for these large internet service providers, which opposed the rules, and a setback for companies like Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, which urged Pai not to rescind the rules. Netflix expressed opposition to the measure on Tuesday, stating it aims to \"roll back these core protections.\"\n\nWith three Republican and two Democratic commissioners, the move is all but certain to be approved. Trump, a Republican, has expressed opposition to net neutrality, calling it a \"power grab\" by Obama in 2014. The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday.\n\nPai's proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules, as internet service is considered an interstate service. This preemption is likely to handcuff Democratic-governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers' equal access to internet content.\n\n\"The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,\" Pai said in an interview. He added that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised \"heavy-handed\" regulation of the internet.\n\n\"We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses,\" Pai added.\n\nTom Wheeler, who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules, called the planned repeal \"a shameful sham and sellout.\" AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon have stated that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing.\n\nComcast stated that it would \"not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.\" Verizon said it believed the FCC \"will reinstate a framework that protects consumers' access to the open internet, without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation.\"\n\nThe Internet Association, representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook, stated that Pai's proposal \"represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans.\" The FCC received more than 22 million comments, and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments.\n\nA U.S. appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations, which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom. The group praised Pai's decision to remove \"antiquated, restrictive regulations\" to \"pave the way for broadband network investment, expansion, and upgrades.\"\n\nThe FCC's repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality. Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. House of Representatives Democrat, stated the FCC move would hurt consumers and chill competition, saying the agency \"has launched an all-out assault on the entrepreneurship, innovation, and competition at the heart of the internet.\" The planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump took office in January.",
    " Title: U.S. Attorney Assigned by Barr to Investigate Russia Probe's Origins is \"Dialed In\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. attorney assigned by Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate the origins of the Russia probe is reportedly making significant progress, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. The attorney, John Durham, has been described as \"very dialed in\" and \"asking all the right questions.\"\n\nRecent meetings between Barr and Durham, who was in Washington, D.C. this month, have been confirmed by sources within the Justice Department to Fox News. Durham has been briefed on the \"four corners\" of the investigations into the FBI's use of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, among other issues.\n\nDurham's high level of engagement in the probe comes after Barr stated he has not received satisfactory answers from the intelligence community in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation. In an interview with CBS News, Barr expressed that he has \"more questions\" and that some facts \"do not hang together with the official explanations of what happened.\"\n\nDurham is specifically reviewing the FISA warrant obtained by the FBI to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page, as well as general issues relating to surveillance during the 2016 campaign and matters flowing from the FISA process. Fox News reports that Durham would handle the prosecution of any criminal action he might uncover.\n\nBefore the 2016 midterm elections, sources tell Fox News, Republicans who controlled key House committees sought to \"tee up\" potential targets for future investigation. Particular attention was drawn to the apparent conflict in testimony between the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, and DOJ official Bruce Ohr. Fusion GPS was retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which in turn hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to write the infamous dossier that the FBI relied on in its FISA application to surveil Page.\n\nSimpson testified to the House Intelligence Committee that he contacted Ohr about the largely discredited dossier after Thanksgiving 2016, but Ohr's records point to contact months earlier, in August. Bruce Ohr became a backchannel for Steele to the FBI in the fall of 2016 after the bureau fired the ex-spy over contacts with the media.\n\nLast month, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows made a criminal referral for Ohr's wife, Nellie, who worked for Fusion GPS. Nellie did extensive opposition research on Trump family members and campaign aides while working for Fusion GPS, according to a transcript of her closed-door interview with Congress.\n\nIn her transcribed interview, Ms. Ohr testified she \"would not have any knowledge of what [was] going on in an ongoing investigation\" at DOJ and would not \"have any knowledge of the Department of Justice\u2019s investigations on Russia.\" Ms. Ohr also denied she shared her research on Russian organized crime and Donald Trump with individuals outside of Fusion GPS (her employer), her husband, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele.\n\nHowever, documents reviewed by our committees raise concerns that Ms. Ohr not only had knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation, but that she shared information and research on Russian organized crime to assist DOJ, in direct contradiction with her testimony.",
    " Title: Congressman Calls for Investigation into Cape Wind Project Amid Allegations of Political Pressure\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Cliff Stearns (R-Fla) has called for a congressional investigation into the nation's first offshore wind farm, Cape Wind, following the release of emails suggesting political pressure was applied to expedite the project's approval. Audra Parker, president of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, an organization opposing the wind farm's development, claims to have obtained documents that allegedly show the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) fast-tracked the project despite safety concerns for local aviation.\n\nParker asserts that the documents, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, reveal a pattern of political pressure and the FAA's subsequent sacrifice of aviation safety in favor of the project. An internal FAA email from 2009 acknowledges the Cape Wind project in Nantucket Sound as \"highly political.\" A 2010 PowerPoint presentation states that the project's approval was politically motivated due to the administration's push for green energy production.\n\nRep. Stearns, who previously led the investigation into the failed solar panel firm Solyndra, compares the Cape Wind project to Solyndra, stating, \"I think the Cape Wind project is something similar to Solyndra in the sense there's a lot of pressure from the White House.\"\n\nCape Wind spokesman Mark Rodgers maintains that the project has undergone extensive review and is confident of its approval, despite the concerns raised by opponents. The FAA is currently reviewing the project again following a federal appeals court's overturning of the agency's ruling that 130 proposed turbines posed \"no hazard\" to aviation.\n\nDespite ongoing legal battles and the potential for further delays, Cape Wind aims to begin construction next year. The battle over the development, however, continues as both sides accuse politics of playing a role in the project's approval process.",

Marks, who was born and raised in South Africa and attended the University of the Witwatersrand, has no diplomatic experience or training.\n\nProfessionally, Marks is recognized for her high-end handbags, which can sell for between $19,000 and $400,000. According to CNN, the concept for her luxury handbags was born when she could not find a bag to match the suit she planned to wear to a birthday celebration for Queen Elizabeth.\n\nMarks' nomination has raised questions about her qualifications for the position, as she has no prior diplomatic experience. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will consider her nomination, and her past legal issues may be taken into account.\n\nIn the past, Marks has been involved in more than a dozen lawsuits in Aspen, New York, California, and South Florida. She has been accused of stiffing attorneys, accountants, landlords, and employees. In July 2015, she was evicted from her office on Worth Avenue for failing to pay $25,399 in rent and other expenses. In 2004, 2007, and 2009, the landlords for her store on Worth Avenue also filed complaints against her for failing to pay rent, although the cases were settled without eviction.\n\nPresident Trump's relationship with South Africa has been controversial. Last August, Trump tweeted that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to \"closely study\" the government's \"large scale\" land seizures and killing of white farmers, which are not actually happening anywhere but in the minds of white supremacists from whom our president apparently gets his policy ideas. With Marks' nomination, it remains to be seen how her qualifications and past legal issues will be evaluated by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
    " Title: Biden Calls for Impeachment of President Trump, Citing Obstruction of Justice and Constitutional Violations\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has expressed his support for the impeachment of President Donald Trump, citing obstruction of justice and violations of the Constitution. During a campaign event in Rochester, N.H., Biden stated, \"With his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself by obstructing justice, refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry.\"\n\nBiden argued that Trump's actions, such as withholding congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine in exchange for political favors, demonstrate a disregard for the Constitution and the rule of law. He continued, \"To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached.\"\n\nBiden had previously signaled his support for the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry but had refrained from taking a position on its conclusion. The investigation was triggered by a whistleblower's complaint against Trump over his pressure on the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of Burisma Holdings until earlier this year.\n\nThe White House released a memo summarizing Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a conversation Trump has defended as \"perfect.\" The call was part of a whistleblower's complaint against the president, which led to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement late last month of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nSince then, a flurry of developments have given added impetus to the impeachment probe. Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn last week, Trump called on China to investigate the Bidens, but the president has yet to provide evidence of any wrongdoing.\n\nIn 2016, then-Vice President Biden pressured Ukraine to remove its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who had investigated Burisma. However, Shokin's investigation had been closed by the time Biden made the demand on the Ukrainian government. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund, along with several congressional Republicans, shared the Obama administration's view of Shokin as corrupt.\n\nBiden's response to Trump's attacks over recent weeks has been criticized as slow and ineffective by some Democrats, raising unpleasant memories of the \"Swift Boat\" attacks by Republicans on Democratic nominee John Kerry in 2004.\n\nIn response to Trump's tweets attacking Biden, Biden's campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, stated, \"We're not going to play Donald Trump's game. We're not going to let him distract from the corruption in his own administration.\"\n\nTrump tweeted, \"So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden, who with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars, calling for my impeachment\u2014and I did nothing wrong.\" Trump also tweeted, \"Joe's Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!\"\n\nBiden responded, \"Thanks for watching. Stop stonewalling the Congress. Honor your oath. Respect the Constitution. And speaking of taxpayers, I've released 21 years of my tax returns. You?\"",
    " Title: Romney Outlines Foreign Policy Differences with Obama, Critics Question Substance\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, outlined his foreign policy positions on Monday, emphasizing a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, conditions on U.S. aid to Egypt, and support for Syrian opposition forces. The speech, delivered at the Virginia Military Institute, aimed to define key differences with President Obama's foreign policy.\n\nRomney accused the Obama administration of passivity on the international stage, stating that the world is left wondering about the U.S.'s stance. He pledged that, if elected, the world would see clear and predictable behavior from the White House.\n\nHowever, critics, including former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, questioned the speech's substance, stating that it lacked specifics on how Romney would operate and understand the Arab world.\n\nRomney emphasized \"bedrock principles\" toward the Middle East, stating that the U.S. must adhere to these principles to provide a stable world. He pledged to champion free trade and reverse the lack of new free-trade agreements signed during Obama's tenure.\n\nOn Iran, Romney did not specify whether he would support a pre-emptive military strike, instead stating that the U.S. must make clear to Iran that its nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated. He also called for new conditions on U.S. aid to Egypt, pushing the new regime to respect democracy and honor its peace treaty commitments with Israel.\n\nWeeks after expressing doubts about a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, Romney reaffirmed his commitment to a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living peacefully with Israel. He criticized the Obama administration for failing to negotiate a peaceful resolution and for allowing the conflict to devolve into disputes at the United Nations.\n\nRegarding Syria, Romney called for the U.S. to do more to arm opposition forces, particularly those the U.S. trusts. He argued that Iran is supplying arms to Assad's regime because it knows Assad's downfall would be a strategic defeat for Iran.\n\nCritics argued that Romney's speech did not articulate a dramatically different vision from Obama's. Gordon Adams, an international relations professor at American University, stated that when it comes to defining exactly what Romney would do, it is the same as what Obama is already doing. Adams added that when it comes to overall U.S. foreign policy, the elusiveness of strategy in the 21st century is intense, particularly in the Middle East.\n\nOn the issue of countering Iranian nuclear ambitions, Albright stated that, short of immediate military action, Romney cannot specify what he would do differently than the president. Regarding U.S. assistance to Egypt, Albright added that the aid is already conditioned on many of the things that Romney listed, such as Egypt meeting its obligations to its peace treaty with Israel and transitioning to democracy.",
    " Title: Constitutionality of Obamacare and Impeachment Discussion\n\nArticle:\n\nSince its enactment in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has faced significant changes and controversy. Critics argue that the law has led to the cancellation of many Americans' healthcare plans and has violated President Obama's promise that individuals could keep their insurance if they liked it.\n\nIn early 2010, before signing Obamacare, President Obama acknowledged during a healthcare summit that up to nine million people might lose their coverage due to the new legislation. In September 2010, every Senate Democrat voted against a resolution aimed at allowing people to keep their healthcare plans.\n\nIn 2013, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius admitted under oath in front of Congress that end-to-end security testing was not conducted on Healthcare.gov before its launch, potentially putting the personal information of Americans at risk.\n\nAssociate Professor of Economics at St. John's University, M. Northrop Buechner, has argued in Forbes that President Obama's changes to Obamacare are unconstitutional, as the Constitution does not authorize the President to change existing laws. Buechner contends that by changing the law based on his own wishes, Obama has set a precedent that could potentially allow him to rewrite or ignore any law.\n\nThe main responsibility the Constitution assigns to the President is to faithfully execute the laws. If the President rejects this duty, as some argue Obama has done, the implications for the future of American governance are unclear.\n\nWhile impeachment is unlikely with a divided Congress, Buechner's argument presents a solid case for impeachment based on the President's disregard for the Constitution. The future of American governance and the role of the President in interpreting and executing laws remains a topic of ongoing debate.",
    " Title: Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann's Retirement Highlights Her Impact on Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nMinnesota Representative Michele Bachmann's announcement on Wednesday that she will not seek a fifth term in Congress has sparked a flurry of commentary, with some on the political left mocking the former 2012 presidential candidate. However, her retirement has also provided a glimpse into Bachmann's impact on Washington.\n\nBachmann, who was first elected to Congress in 2006, has amassed a portfolio of missteps and fabrications during her tenure. Yet, she has also secured a place in political history by riding the Tea Party wave early and parlaying an unrepentant, cable-ready persona and House seat to national conspicuousness.\n\nEven her detractors acknowledge that Bachmann's audacity helped open the door for conservative female candidates and new Republican Tea Party favorites, such as Texas Senator Ted Cruz and, to some extent, Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Bachmann also established herself as a fundraising juggernaut, raising nearly $15 million for her 2012 race against Democrat Jim Graves, who spent about $2.3 million in a race that was nationalized by her polarizing politics.\n\nConservative blogger Dan Riehl, who chose to \"ignore most of the calamity, the gaffes\" that have punctuated her political career, describes Bachmann as a voice against the Republican establishment, a thorn in its side. \"In certain ways, she was an iconic figure\u2014effective just because she was there... She was kicking on the door early and was isolated. You have some people benefiting from the heat she took,\" Riehl says.\n\nBachmann's national profile was not built on her effectiveness as a legislator; she was rated as a House backbencher during her time on Capitol Hill. However, she founded the House Tea Party Caucus, became a face of the emerging movement, and made \"repeal Obamacare\" her clarion call, thus guaranteeing a role on the national stage.\n\nKathryn Pearson, an American politics expert and associate professor at the University of Minnesota, notes that Bachmann skillfully used the media, particularly cable media, to articulate a very conservative message and articulate opposition to the Obama administration in ways that went beyond that of mainstream Republicans. \"She did not do a lot legislatively; it was not her focus,\" Pearson says, \"but she gave voice to Tea Party members and made life difficult for her party's leadership.\"\n\nBachmann's penchant for hyperbole, if not outright falsity, made her ubiquitous in the cable TV arena but tarnished her reputation as a serious political player and made a wide swath of her home state Republicans cringe. \"To the degree that she was a laughingstock\u2014that's not good when you're a Republican in Minnesota,\" says Sarah Janecek, a GOP activist and founder of Politics in Minnesota, a state public affairs news service.\n\nBachmann was not always good for national Republicans either, as the party attempted to broaden its appeal. She proved to be a reliable villain for Democrats, who often used her over-the-top comments to fuel their own direct-mail fundraising efforts. \"She was a polarizing figure and has drawn a lot of fire, and made some missteps,\" says Riehl, the conservative blogger. \"The Tea Party movement, however, in some ways, has moved ahead of her now, grown beyond her, and is not as handcuffed to the social right.\"\n\nEven so, Bachmann's improbable, audacious run for the presidential nomination in 2012 still resonates with Riehl and other Republicans. \"She wasn't the first conservative bomb-thrower from the House to run for president, but she proved a more viable candidate than any other before her campaign fizzled prior to the Iowa caucuses,\" Riehl says. \"Say what you want, but she was a woman making her way into an all-boys' club, and because she was on the right, she didn't have women's groups rallying around her.\"\n\nBachmann's detractors provided her with a lot of material, but earlier this month, 400 people turned out to see her at a local Tea Party gathering. \"She packed the house,\" says Jake Duesenberg, who heads the East Metro Tea Party organization that reaches into her district. \"You can say this or that about how she messages, but she stood up for free markets, fiscal responsibility, and respect for the Constitution.\"",
    " Title: Obama Campaign Faces Questions on Economic Progress\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, then-candidate Barack Obama stated that he would be a \"one-term proposition\" if people did not feel better off after three years of his presidency. This statement is now being revisited during the current election cycle, as questions about the nation's economic progress under Obama's administration have arisen.\n\nThe debate began with Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley's flip-flop on the issue. On CBS's Face the Nation, O'Malley stated that the nation is not better off, but later tweeted that the country is creating jobs and, therefore, better off.\n\nThe question of economic progress also followed Vice President Joe Biden on the campaign trail in Detroit. Biden asserted that the nation is better off, but did not provide specific reasons.\n\nObama campaign senior adviser David Axelrod and Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace had a back-and-forth discussion about the issue. Wallace asked Axelrod if the average American is better off than four years ago, to which Axelrod responded that it took years to create the economic crisis that occurred in 2008 and peaked in January 2009, and it will take time to work through it.\n\nOn CNN's Early Start, anchor John Berman asked Democratic National Committee spokesman Brad Woodhouse if the nation is better off than four years ago. Woodhouse responded that the nation is better off.\n\nObama campaign deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter was also asked on the Today Show if the nation is better off than it was four years ago when Obama was elected. Cutter responded that the nation is better off and proceeded to outline the state of the economy four years ago.\n\nJournalist Jake Tapper noted in a post that being honest about the fact that the nation is not better off may not be a winning strategy, but the soundbites from Democrats on the issue are still being circulated, and many people are aware of the struggles faced by those who are out of a job or whose businesses are still struggling. It remains to be seen if the Obama campaign will provide a more detailed explanation of the nation's economic progress.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Engage in Escalating Trade War\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States and China have initiated a trade war, with President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods entering the U.S. This marks the beginning of a conflict that shows no signs of abating soon. The tariffs, which took effect just after midnight Washington time on Friday, target products such as farming plows and airplane parts. China retaliated immediately with duties on U.S. exports, including soybeans and automobiles.\n\nNeither side appears to be backing down, with Trump already considering another $16 billion of Chinese goods and indicating that the final tariff total could exceed $500 billion, nearly the same amount the U.S. imported from China in 2017. China's Commerce Ministry has accused the U.S. of \"bullying\" and igniting \"the largest trade war in economic history.\"\n\nThe tariffs, which are the first ever U.S. tariffs aimed solely at China, are expected to rally Trump's voters who support his \"America First\" argument that China has not played fair for years, stealing American intellectual property and undercutting its manufacturers. However, the risk is that the conflict could undermine economic growth by complicating international supply chains and increasing prices for companies and consumers.\n\nThe initial impact of the tariffs on some items will be significant. For instance, the tariff on pure-electric vehicles, such as Tesla, will rise to 40 percent of the value from the current 15 percent. U.S. whiskey will be taxed 30 percent, compared with 5 percent for alcohol from other nations. U.S. soybeans, a key flashpoint in the worsening trade relations, will see their tariff increase to 28 percent of the value, while the soybean duty for some other nations has been lowered to zero recently.\n\nThe extent of the economic damage will depend on how far both sides go. If the U.S. and China cool off after a first round of tariffs, the fallout will be modest, according to \u2588\u2588\u2588 Economics. Under a full-blown trade war in which the U.S. imposes 10 percent tariffs on all other countries and they respond, the economists reckon U.S. growth would slow by 0.8 percentage point by 2020.\n\nBeijing has shown little interest in making fundamental changes to its economic model. President Xi Jinping has balked at U.S. demands to stop subsidizing Chinese firms under his plan to make the nation a leader in key technologies by 2025. The strength and size of both economies mean the fight could rage on for years.\n\nIn the past, the U.S. has used its influence to win trade skirmishes with developing countries. China, whose economy has grown tenfold since it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, poses a much more formidable adversary. \"The dynamic is different from anything we've seen,\" said James Boughton, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Ontario. \"China has an ability to ride out this kind of pressure, to weather the storm, that a lot of countries didn't have in the past.\"\n\nOn Friday, Trump was uncharacteristically reserved on Twitter about the trade dispute with China. \"JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!\" he tweeted after the employment numbers.",
    " Title: Lost Friendship Over Political Differences: A Personal Account of the Divisive Election Aftermath\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a personal account, a writer recounts the estrangement from a longtime friend, a Hollywood agent, following the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. The friend, a leftist, had been a significant part of the writer's life for decades, but their relationship has been severed since the election due to their differing political views.\n\nThe writer voted for Donald Trump, while their friend was a vocal opponent of the President. The writer claims that their friend was terrified of Trump, but they could not understand the reason. On election night, the writer admitted to their friend that they had been wrong about Trump's chances of winning, and that they had voted for Trump out of revulsion at Hillary Clinton's arrogance.\n\nSince the election, the writer has reached out to their friend multiple times, but their attempts have been met with silence or angry responses. The writer sent their friend two large plants and another letter asking for a conversation, but received no response.\n\nThe writer notes that similar stories have been shared by friends and colleagues, suggesting a widespread rift among people due to political differences. The writer questions why Trump is causing such rage and bitterness, as policy issues are not typically the source of such strong emotions.\n\nThe writer suggests that the reason for the intense hatred and fear of Trump may be due to his personality, citing the theory that some people are repulsed by a strong and dominant father figure. The writer also notes the left's capacity for hate, comparing it to historical events such as the Two Minute Hates in George Orwell's 1984, Kristallnacht, and KKK lynchings.\n\nThe writer questions why the left is almost always the source of such hate and rage, and why there are no mass marches or riots from other groups demanding an end to certain policies. The writer concludes by expressing their sadness over the loss of their friend and questioning why Trump, whose speeches are often seen as meaningless clich\u00e9s, is causing such strong reactions. The writer also mentions the Nobel Peace Prize and Bob Dylan's decision not to accept his Nobel Prize for Literature.",
    " Title: Trump Accuses Mueller's Office of Coercing Witnesses Amidst Ongoing Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday, President Donald Trump accused the special counsel's office of attempting to coerce witnesses to testify against him. The accusations come after the special counsel's office accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to the FBI about the Russia investigation and violating a plea agreement.\n\nTrump's reference to three \"major players\" appears to refer to Manafort, long-time political adviser Roger Stone, and conservative writer Jerome Corsi, an ally of Stone who said he rejected a plea deal from Mueller. Lawmakers and legal analysts suggest that the president is trying to damage Mueller's reputation ahead of an expected report on Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election in Trump's favor.\n\nProsecutors are examining whether Trump and his campaign worked with Russians who hacked Democratic emails and pushed fake news about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and whether the president has sought to obstruct that investigation. Trump has repeatedly denied collusion and obstruction, and accused Mueller's office of political motivations.\n\nTrump's legal team has joint defense agreements with witnesses in the Mueller investigation, and they have shared information about the probe. Manafort, Stone, Corsi, and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani have all accused Mueller's office of coercing testimony.\n\nGiuliani accused prosecutors of treating Manafort \"like he\u2019s a terrorist, incarcerating him before trial, solitary incarceration and repeated questioning\" about Trump. In a text, Giuliani said they are \"willing to exert unusual pressure that could tempt someone to lie and get out of jail.\"\n\nAfter his conviction on financial fraud charges, Manafort struck a deal to cooperate with Mueller's team in September \u2013 yet maintained his joint defense agreement with Manafort, an unusual development. Former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, a CNN legal analyst, tweeted that Manafort's decision to do so was \"highly deceptive and undermined Mueller's investigation.\"\n\nIn accusing Trump of seeking to undermine Mueller, some lawmakers have proposed legislation to protect the special counsel's job. They have also accused Manafort and other witnesses of seeking pardons from the president. The proposed legislation \"would protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller and future Special Counsels from inappropriate removal or political pressure,\" said a statement from the office of Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump has no plans to get rid of Mueller. \"The President has had Robert Mueller doing his job for the last two years, and he could've taken action at any point, and he hasn\u2019t,\" Sanders said. \"So we'll let that speak for itself.\" Sanders also said, \"I'm not aware of any conversations for anyone's pardon involving this process at all.\"\n\nAdditional reporting indicates that Manafort has been giving Trump's legal team updates on what Mueller asks, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to stop the bill to protect Mueller's job even after the No. 2 GOP leader floated the possibility of it.",
    " Title: House Democrats Introduce For The People Act, a Comprehensive Voting and Ethics Reform Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Democrats have introduced the For The People Act, also known as HR 1, a 571-page bill aimed at addressing issues in four key areas: voting, political money, redistricting, and ethics. The bill, which serves as the first legislative action of the new Democratic House, is a compilation of existing problems and proposed solutions.\n\nRep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) stated, \"We heard loud and clear from the American people. They feel left out and locked out from their own democracy.\" If the bill were to become law, it is unlikely to happen this year due to Republican control of the Senate, a Republican president, and the GOP's vehement opposition to the bill's approach.\n\nThe bill includes provisions that push the envelope, such as taking away the power of state legislatures to draw congressional districts and having independent commissions do it instead. This move is intended to prevent local politicians from gerrymandering districts to help their party and cripple the opposition.\n\nOther proposals in the bill are not surprising, such as an update of the Disclose Act, a pro-transparency measure that Democrats have introduced regularly since 2010. The bill also includes measures to make voter registration easier, such as allowing citizens to register online or automatically via data from driver's licenses or other government sources. For federal elections, states would have to provide same-day registration and at least 15 days of early voting, with Election Day declared a federal holiday.\n\nThe bill also aims to crack down on efforts to take voters off the rolls or prevent them from casting ballots. Felons could regain their voting rights after finishing their sentences. Federal elections would require paper ballots to prevent computer tampering, and state chief election officials could not get involved in federal campaigns.\n\nThe bill declares an intent to revive core anti-discrimination provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that were effectively shut down by the Supreme Court six years ago. It also states that failing to vote is not grounds for taking away a person's voter registration.\n\nProvisions from the Disclose Act would expand the prohibition on foreign political money and mandate the disclosure of the big donors behind politically active 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations. Digital companies, like Facebook and Google, would have to set up public databases cataloging political ad purchase requests of $500 or more and create new measures to block ad buys by foreign nationals.\n\nPresidential inaugural committees would have to disclose expenditures, in addition to the existing requirement for donor disclosure. This is a response to reports of unexplained spending by Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nA new matching-fund program would support House candidates who agree to raise only small-dollar contributions. Similar provisions for Senate candidates would have to come from the Senate. The public financing system for presidential candidates, largely irrelevant since 2012, would be updated.\n\nThe bill would quash \"sidecar\" superPACs that support individual candidates.",
    " Title: Decline in Military Equipment Transfers to Police Departments Despite Trump Executive Order\n\nArticle:\n\nThe amount of surplus military equipment sent to local police departments across the United States has significantly decreased in recent months, despite an executive order signed by President Trump in August 2017 that aimed to increase such transfers, according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis.\n\nShipments of military gear in the first three months of 2018 fell by half compared to the same period in 2017, Department of Defense data shows. The value of armored vehicles, high-caliber rifles, and other equipment also decreased.\n\nTrump's executive order rescinded limits imposed on the program by the Obama administration in response to the controversial police response to the Ferguson, Missouri, riots in 2014. Some police officials have approached the program cautiously despite robust support from Trump.\n\nSgt. Stephen Wells, a spokesman for the Kern County Sheriff's Office in California, which ordered about 90 military items from the Pentagon in 2015 but only one last year, stated, \"If you have a long rifle or you have a military vehicle, it looks bad. We're not an occupying force.\"\n\nSince 1991, the program has recycled approximately $6.8 billion in military equipment purchased by federal taxpayers. The program came under scrutiny following the Ferguson riots, with images of officers wearing tactical gear and standing alongside armored vehicles being broadcast across network news and drawing bipartisan criticism in Congress.\n\nIn response, Obama placed limits on some kinds of equipment in 2015. Obama stated then that the show of force opened a rift between the police and the community at a time when both would have benefited from better relations.\n\nHowever, Trump administration officials argued that the restrictions went too far, limiting police from obtaining equipment that could help them meet modern challenges. Trump's order was touted by those officials as a way to increase the flow of \"lifesaving gear\" to police.\n\nAnnouncing the order last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized Obama for the limits and vowed that the Trump administration would not \"put superficial concerns above public safety.\"\n\nThe data show a bump in shipments in September, the month immediately following Trump's action, but that appears to have been an anomaly. The average monthly value of military gear shipped to local departments in 2016 was just over $17 million. So far this year, the average monthly value stands at $5.2 million.\n\nA White House spokeswoman referred questions to the Justice Department. A spokeswoman at Justice referred questions to the Defense Department. A spokeswoman for the Defense Logistics Agency, which oversees the program, stated that this year's decline is \"likely due to those\u2026 items not being available.\"\n\nThe spokeswoman, Michelle McCaskill, described the change ushered in by Trump's executive order as \"minimal.\"\n\nWhile some police departments are more aware of the public relations concerns associated with the equipment, Wells and others suggested that local law enforcement is unlikely to abandon the program entirely. The equipment remains crucial for dangerous situations such as an active shooter.\n\nBy far the most common item transferred to police last year were military rifles, followed by weapon sights and night-vision goggles.\n\nJames Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, stated he believes Trump's order has put police across the nation in a stronger position. Both Trump and Sessions closely aligned with rank-and-file police during the presidential campaign.\n\nPasco speculated that the drop-off is a coincidence, though he also acknowledged that some local political leaders have been reluctant to embrace the program with zeal.\n\n\"If there's a spate of additional unrest, then I predict that there'll be a greater demand,\" he said.\n\nCritics pounced on the program again last year when the Government Accountability Office created a fictitious agency and obtained more than 100 military items worth $1.2 million, including night-vision goggles and simulated pipe bombs.\n\n\u2588\u2588\u2588's analysis focused exclusively on equipment the Department of Defense altered, or \"demilitarized,\" before transferring it to a local government. That means rifles, armored trucks, night-vision sniper scopes, and other war-fighting equipment were included, but not radios, boots, and printers.\n\nThe Project on Government Oversight, a Washington-based watchdog group, predicted last fall that Trump's order would have little effect on the shipments. The more significant change, experts said, has been on how the government oversees the program.\n\n\"Trump did not make a huge difference in what is or is not allowed, despite statements from some in the administration,\" said Peter Tyler, a senior policy analyst with the group. \"Mostly what the Obama-era order did was put in some very helpful accountability steps.\"\n\nRick Myers, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, stated he was not surprised Trump's order did not result in a sustained increase in demand. The problem with the program, he said, is not the equipment, but how some departments used it.\n\n\"Police chiefs across the country are a little more sensitive to the optics,\" Myers said. \"I think we're just maybe a little smarter about it.\"",

This belief is echoed in the assertion that families, particularly mothers, are the foundation of society and the key to America's future.\n\nThe article argues that the state of America's homes today is a reflection of its future. A friend of the author, who teaches at Schofield Army Barracks in Hawaii, shares her experience of fifth-grade students who no longer pledge the flag, prompting concerns about the future of America's appreciation for its values and freedoms.\n\nThe piece emphasizes the role of mothers in instilling a love for liberty, as schools, media, and even churches are no longer teaching these values. The author quotes Peter Wolf, who suggests that parents should become the first line of defense, dedicating time and effort to teach their children about American history, heroes, and the link between liberty and personal responsibility.\n\nThe article concludes by highlighting the power of mothers in shaping the future, quoting E.T. Sullivan, who said, \"The greatest forces in the world are not the earthquakes and thunderbolts. The greatest forces in the world are babies.\" The author encourages mothers to recognize their influence and importance in shaping the future of America.\n\nThe article ends with a call to action, directing readers to resources such as HomeMakers for America and Libraries of Hope, which aim to promote a love of liberty in children. The author emphasizes that the future of America lies in the hands of mothers, and the ideas they instill in their children.",

    " Title: Researchers Develop Biodegradable Tube for Peripheral Nerve Repair in Mice and Monkeys\n\nArticle:\n\nResearchers at the University of Pittsburgh have developed a biodegradable tube that can effectively bridge gaps in peripheral nerves, according to a study published in Science Translational Medicine. The tube, which releases a growth factor protein for several months, guides the nerve to grow along the correct path and induces faster growth.\n\nThe device, which professor Kacey Marra has been working on for over a dozen years, is particularly aimed at helping soldiers injured in combat, as more than half of injured soldiers suffer nerve injuries. Combat gear protects a soldier's chest and head, but arms and legs are often exposed, leading to common peripheral nerve injuries.\n\nIn the U.S., there are approximately 600,000 nerve injuries each year, though the number of severe injuries requiring the relocation of a second nerve is not currently tracked. The current treatment for severe nerve injuries is to take a nerve from another part of the body, but patients typically recover only about 50 to 60 percent of function in the damaged nerve.\n\nThe new device restored nearly 80 percent of function, according to the study. It uses glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a protein that promotes nerve cell survival. The tube is made of the same polymer as dissolvable stitches, which has already been federally approved for surgical use.\n\nOther researchers are exploring the use of stem cells or other cells to help bridge the gap in the nerve, but Marra and her colleagues' approach is likely to have an easier time receiving federal approval because it does not involve cells. \"If they were to go adding stem cells or too many complexities, it would be harder to win a regulatory green light,\" says Christine Schmidt, a professor and chair of the department of biomedical engineering at the University of Florida, who was not involved with the research.\n\nThe nerve the Pittsburgh team tested is relatively small in macaques. \"It will still be a challenge to scale up to larger nerves,\" says Schmidt. \"It would be nice to see a little bit larger nerve, which would be more relevant to patients.\"\n\nThe new device is expected to start clinical trials in humans in 2021 and take at least three years. Marra's team is also beginning to study whether its method will work for facial nerves, but she thinks it is unlikely to be effective for spinal cord injuries, which are far more complex and involve more nerves. The researchers are also looking at regenerating the muscles affected by injured nerves.\n\n\"I think [this approach] really could revolutionize thinking about nerve repair and the different options a patient will have,\" Marra says.",
    " Title: U.S. Navy Reduces Carrier Presence in Persian Gulf Due to Budget Constraints\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Navy will reduce its aircraft carrier presence in the Persian Gulf from two to one, according to Pentagon officials. This decision, which goes into effect immediately, is a response to looming budget constraints and the potential for automatic budget cuts that have not been averted.\n\nIn a statement, Pentagon spokesman George Little confirmed the Navy's request to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who approved the decision. The deployment of the USS Harry S. Truman, scheduled to leave from Norfolk, Virginia, on Friday, has been cancelled.\n\nThe USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was in the Gulf but returned home in December for maintenance, will return later this month. At that point, the USS John C. Stennis, currently the only carrier in the Gulf, will leave the region and return home.\n\nOfficials say that if Congress cannot avert $500 billion in defense cuts over the next 10 years, the Navy cannot justify the cost of two carriers in the region. However, the Navy could be \"surge-ready\" and deploy more carriers in a crisis situation.\n\nThe Navy has 10 aircraft carriers in its fleet, and, as of today, only three were forward-deployed at any given time. Two were in the Persian Gulf and one was permanently stationed in Japan. Now, the Navy will only have two forward-deployed carriers.\n\nTypically, carriers spend six months at sea, but their deployments have lasted closer to nine months due to budget constraints. A Navy official says the Pentagon would save \"several hundred million dollars per year\" by reducing to one carrier in the Gulf.\n\nThe move by the Pentagon comes as lawmakers argue over how, if at all, to avoid a March 1 deadline, after which automatic cuts to the Pentagon and other areas of the budget will begin to take effect. President Obama called Tuesday for a short-term bill to avert the cuts, but Republicans criticized this approach as irresponsible.\n\nA group of Republican lawmakers on Wednesday proposed a bill to cut the federal workforce and use the savings to replace $85 billion in across-the-board budget cuts to the Pentagon and domestic programs. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta outlined a grim list of spending cuts the Pentagon may have to make in the coming weeks.\n\nIn separate, highly detailed memos sent to Congress, the military services described widespread civilian furloughs, layoffs, and hiring freezes that will affect workers around the country. Overall, the military will furlough 800,000 civilian workers for 22 days, spread across more than five months, and will lay off as many as 46,000 temporary and contract employees.\n\nThe Navy says it will cease deployments to South America and the Caribbean and limit those to Europe. The Air Force warned that it would cut operations at various missile defense radar sites from 24 hours to eight hours. And the Army said it would cancel training center rotations for four brigades and cancel repairs for thousands of vehicles, radios, and weapons.\n\nIn addition to these immediate cuts, U.S. troops are likely to see a smaller pay hike next year than initially planned, due to strains on the budget. According to a defense official, the Pentagon will recommend that the military get a 1 percent pay increase in 2014, instead of a 1.7 percent raise.\n\nDefense Secretary Leon Panetta is expected to leave the Pentagon this month.

The call, the first since the release of the Mueller report, covered various topics, including the \"Russian hoax,\" as Trump referred to it in a tweet.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, Trump shared details of their latest conversation, stating, \"Had a long and very good conversation with President Putin.\" He further emphasized the importance of good relations with Russia, China, and other nations.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter if he had warned Putin against meddling in the 2020 elections, Trump responded by labeling the reporter as \"very rude.\" He reiterated his stance on international relations, stating, \"Getting along with countries is a good thing and we want to have good relations with everybody.\"\n\nHowever, the White House confirmed that the issue of alleged Russian meddling was discussed during the call. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders stated, \"Very, very briefly it was discussed, essentially in the context that it's over, and there was no collusion.\"\n\nSanders also mentioned that Trump and Putin had briefly discussed the investigation by US Special Counsel Robert Mueller into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The White House press secretary described the call as an \"overall positive conversation.\"\n\nA redacted version of the special counsel's report was made public last month. It concluded that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election \"in sweeping and systematic fashion.\" The interference took the form of an extensive social media campaign and hacking into Democratic Party servers by Russian military intelligence. The inquiry did not determine the Trump campaign had conspired with Russia.\n\nIn addition to the election meddling discussion, the leaders also touched upon thorny foreign policy issues. The specifics of these discussions have not been disclosed.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Proposes New Carbon Emission Regulations for Power Companies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has proposed new regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions in the United States. The regulations call for America's power companies to generate 28 percent of the country's energy from renewable sources by 2030, up from the current 11 percent. Over the same period, these companies must cut carbon emissions to 32 percent of 2005 levels.\n\nThe new rules are intended to position the United States as a leader in addressing climate change ahead of a global climate change conference in Paris later this year. However, the regulations will face numerous challenges, including legal disputes, potential lapses under subsequent administrations, and opposition from energy companies.\n\nThe success of the president's new energy vision hinges on public support. In a survey by the Pew Research Center, global warming was ranked as the 22nd priority for the president and Congress, with only 38 percent considering it a top priority, compared to 76 percent who chose terrorism.\n\nThe regulations are expected to lead to upheaval in the energy industry, with potentially hundreds of coal-fired power plants being closed. Critics argue that price increases will be significant. Germany, which has pursued a similar path, has experienced high energy prices as a result.\n\nGermany, which currently generates 27 percent of its power from renewable sources, has faced challenges in its transition to green energy. The country's double whammy of ramping up renewable energy while shutting down nuclear power has contributed to price increases.\n\nIn contrast, private individuals and farmers in Germany accounted for 46 percent of renewable energy production in 2012, while the \"big four\" power providers accounted for only 5 percent. This suggests that Germany's green power revolution is being driven by individuals with solar cells and windmills, not major power companies.\n\nSweden, which has taxed carbon emissions aggressively since 1991, offers some insights. In 2013, President Obama cited Sweden as providing \"good lessons.\" Currently, 47 percent of Sweden's energy comes from renewable sources, mostly hydropower, with virtually no coal usage.\n\nThe Obama administration claims that the new regulations will not increase energy prices. However, the transition to renewable energy is expected to bring significant changes to the way power companies operate, including the increased production of green energy and the acceptance of more consumers generating their own power.\n\nThe new regulations are based on giving states flexibility, with each allowed to create its own plan under the guidelines laid out by the EPA. If states refuse to create their own plans, the Obama administration will impose a plan. The regulations are likely to face opposition from Republicans, who have labeled the approach as \"cap and tax.\"\n\nSweden's approach to carbon emissions and renewable energy may provide some guidance for the United States. The country has taxed carbon emissions aggressively since 1991 and currently generates 47 percent of its energy from renewable sources.",
    " Title: U.S. Grand Princess Cruise Ship Reports 21 Coronavirus Cases, Eight More States Confirm First Infections\n\nArticle:\n\nTwenty-one individuals aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship have tested positive for coronavirus, U.S. officials announced on Friday. The vessel, carrying approximately 3,500 passengers and crew, was barred from docking in San Francisco.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who is leading the White House's response to the outbreak, stated at a news conference that 19 crew members and two passengers out of 46 people tested so far on the ship have the virus. The Grand Princess will be taken to a non-commercial port, where everyone on board will be tested.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump expressed a preference for keeping passengers on the vessel but stated that he would defer to others regarding disembarkation. \"I'd rather have them stay on, personally, but I fully understand if they want to take them off,\" Trump said after touring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.\n\nAllowing passengers onto U.S. soil who might be infected would increase the number of coronavirus cases in the country, Trump noted. \"I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault,\" Trump said.\n\nKeeping passengers quarantined aboard a coronavirus-hit ship has proven disastrous in Japan, leading to one of the world's biggest outbreaks.\n\nEight states - Pennsylvania, Indiana, Minnesota, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Nebraska, South Carolina, and Hawaii - reported their first cases on Friday, meaning more than half of the 50 U.S. states now have the virus.\n\nThe respiratory illness, which emerged in China and has spread to over 90 nations, has killed more than 3,400 people and infected over 100,000 worldwide.\n\nAs stocks plunge and U.S. companies grapple with the economic fallout, the Trump administration is reportedly considering tax relief for the cruise, travel, and airline industries.\n\nA poll by \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos shows Americans are sharply divided over the dangers of the new coronavirus. Critics of Trump, including Democratic lawmakers, have accused the president of downplaying the significance of the outbreak for political reasons. He has stated the risk to Americans is low.\n\nThe crisis has hit stocks hard. The benchmark S&P 500 closed down another 1.7% on Friday, after falling nearly 3% the day before.\n\nAs new states report their first cases, others see their tallies grow. Cases in New York jumped to 44 from 22, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday, adding that some 4,000 people in the state are under precautionary quarantine and 44 under mandatory quarantine.\n\nAmid widespread criticism of a lack of available tests for states in need, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged that \"some missteps\" had initially slowed the distribution of tests, but said the overall response was going well. \"In the next couple of weeks, we should be ratcheted up to get many more out,\" Fauci said on NBC's Today program.",
    " Title: College Republican National Committee Report: GOP Faces Challenges in Attracting Young Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nThe College Republican National Committee (CRNC) has released a detailed report, titled \"Grand Old Party for a Brand New Generation,\" which offers a critical analysis of the Republican Party's struggles in appealing to young voters. The report, based on extensive polling and focus groups, outlines the challenges the GOP faces in addressing key issues, messaging, and outreach to young voters.\n\nThe 95-page study, which examines the party's stance on social and economic issues, as well as its messaging and outreach, paints a grim picture of the current situation. The report is particularly critical of the GOP's focus on downsizing government and cutting taxes, offensive and polarizing rhetoric, and ineffective messaging and outreach efforts.\n\nThe report highlights several areas of concern, including:\n\n1. Gay marriage: The report states, \"On the \u2018open-minded\u2019 issue... we will face serious difficulty so long as the issue of gay marriage remains on the table.\"\n2. Hispanics: \"Latino voters... tend to think the GOP couldn\u2019t care less about them.\"\n3. Perception of the party's economic stance: \"We\u2019ve become the party that will pat you on your back when you make it, but won\u2019t offer you a hand to help you get there.\"\n4. Big reason for the image problem: \"The outrageous statements made by errant Republican voices.\"\n\nThe report also reveals the words that up-for-grabs voters associate with the GOP: closed-minded, racist, rigid, and old-fashioned.\n\nDespite the critical assessment, the report maintains hope for the future, stating, \"The Republican Party has won the youth vote before and can absolutely win it again.\" The report points to presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, who were competitive with young voters, as examples of past success. However, the report emphasizes that significant work is needed to repair the damage done to the Republican brand among young voters over the last decade.\n\nThe report is based on two national surveys of 800 registered voters each, ages 18-29, and six focus groups of young people from diverse backgrounds who had voted for President Barack Obama but were considered \"winnable\" for the GOP. The surveys were developed by the Winston Group, a Washington-based GOP polling firm. The cost of the study was not disclosed, but Alex Schriver, who served as the chairman of the CRNC during the election and is a co-author of the report, called it a \"significant investment.\"\n\nThe CRNC will publicly release the study on Monday and present their findings privately to Republican officials and outside groups. The specific attendees for the private presentation were not specified.",
    " Title: Impact of Leaks on U.S. Intelligence Efforts: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent wave of leaks has sparked debate among experts regarding the potential harm to U.S. intelligence efforts. James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, has claimed that the leaks have caused \"huge, grave damage\" to intelligence gathering capabilities. However, Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian columnist who facilitated the leaks, disputes this claim, stating that the leaks have not jeopardized national security in any way.\n\nWhile the exact extent of the damage is uncertain, intelligence experts and former officials interviewed by various media outlets suggest that there will likely be some harm to U.S. intelligence efforts. The primary negative impact is expected to fall on the U.S. Internet industry, as some of its international customer base may flee in search of sites thought to be more secure from American government snooping.\n\nThe concern is not so much the specifics of what was leaked, but rather the widespread publicity the leaks generated. Every news story could serve as a revelation to some terrorists, and a reminder to others, of the nation's capabilities. This increased awareness could potentially tip off or encourage less skilled terrorists to behave more furtively.\n\nWhile terrorists are often perceived as well-informed, ex-intelligence officials argue that their skill sets run the gamut. The biggest terror threat in the United States currently seems to be homegrown extremists who are not hardened operatives and who lack first-rate tradecraft. These are the precisely the sorts of novices who could be tipped off or decide to behave more furtively because of the recent spate of surveillance disclosures.\n\nIntelligence agencies rely on other people's mistakes, former NSA general counsel Joel Brenner notes. \"You'd be surprised at how many people make mistakes,\" he said.\n\nMichael Hayden, former NSA Director, insists that even the wording in stories sometimes tips off terrorists. He ran off-the-record seminars for journalists at NSA headquarters, where he and others from the spy agency urged reporters to replace terms like \"intercepts\" in their stories with vaguer phrases like \"intelligence reports.\" Such seemingly minor changes affect the way targets of U.S. intelligence behave, he said.\n\nThere remains considerable dispute about whether the harm in the recent wave of leaks comes directly from the leaks themselves or from media coverage that has treated them as earth-shattering revelations. Before the first leak last week about Verizon call data being gathered on a daily basis, there was ample reason for both privacy-sensitive Americans and well-informed terrorists to suspect that the government had been gathering a great deal of information on calling patterns. However, the extent to which this information was known is difficult to assess.",
    " Title: President Trump's Independence Day Address at Mount Rushmore: A Call to Courage and Preservation of American Values\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his Independence Day address at Mount Rushmore, President Donald Trump emphasized the nation's birth not as a result of peace and reflection, but out of crisis and courage. The speech served as a call to courage in the face of the current challenges the country is facing, including civil unrest, the pandemic, and societal discord.\n\nThe President highlighted the sacrifices made by historical figures such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt, who risked their lives in battles, on the battlefields of the American Revolution, the frigid desolation of Valley Forge, and in Cuba, respectively. These individuals were instrumental in shaping the United States and embodying the American spirit of courage and bravery.\n\nThe monument at Mount Rushmore, depicting these four American heroes, stands as a reminder of the hardships previous generations of Americans faced in preserving their culture and civilization from both foreign and domestic enemies. The President's speech served as an exaltation to this American tradition of courage and a call to honor the legacy of these heroes.\n\nThe President's speech also touched upon the current state of the nation, where the radical fringe is attempting to erase the Founding Fathers and American heroes from history. The President compared the isolation experienced under state and local lockdown protocols to the hardships faced by soldiers at Valley Forge and the settlers and pioneers who conquered the American interior.\n\nThe President's speech concluded with a call to action for Americans to stand united in preserving and strengthening the heritage passed down by the Founding Fathers. The President warned against the radical fringe's attempts to redefine America and destroy its values, emphasizing the nation's faith in its Creator and reverence for the Founders and their vision of government by and for the people.\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, a conservative commentator and longtime host of the television show Huckabee, praised the President's speech as an optimistic message that the United States has faced and overcome greater challenges in the past and will do so again with the right leadership. Huckabee is a New York Times best-selling author and host of the popular weekly talk show Huckabee, which airs on TBN.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Record Deportations: A Look at the Numbers and Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn October 2010, the Obama administration boasted of deporting a record number of illegal immigrants. This was revealed in a Washington Post report that uncovered a memo from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) setting a goal of 400,000 deportations. The document urged agents to focus on criminal alien removals but expressed concern about the low number of non-criminal removals.\n\nThe memo stated, \"the other Agency critical goal of achieving 400,000 removals and returns overall,\" and later warned they were \"well under the Agency\u2019s goal of 400,000\" at that time. Under pressure from immigration activists, the administration's record deportations have become a contentious issue, similar to the controversy surrounding the president's health plan.\n\nIn a recent statement, President Obama acknowledged the ineffectiveness of immigration enforcement, stating, \"It\u2019s not smart, it doesn\u2019t make sense.\" Vice President Joe Biden responded to a heckler's call to \"Stop the deportations\" by saying, \"We\u2019ll do that too, kid.\"\n\nActivists have criticized the Obama administration's deportation policies, with some suggesting that deportation is an illegitimate policy tool. However, many argue that criminal aliens should be removed from the country, while those who are merely in the U.S. illegally should not be deported.\n\nOne group's statement reads, \"Not one more family destroyed, not one more day without equality, not one more indifferent reaction to suffering, not one more deportation.\" This perspective has been criticized as extreme, as it suggests that no one should be deported until all problems related to immigration are solved.\n\nBarbara Jordan, a civil rights icon who chaired Bill Clinton's commission to reform immigration in the 1990s, understood the importance of enforcing immigration laws. She stated, \"Those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out, are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to leave.\" Jordan emphasized that for immigration policy to be credible, people actually have to be deported at the end of the process.\n\nIn 2013, 59 percent of deportees were convicted of a crime, and a third were felons, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. When repeat immigration violators, illegal border crossings, and immigration fugitives are included, 98 percent of the people deported last year were deemed removable.\n\nThe Obama administration's record deportations have been a source of criticism on the left, with some arguing that the administration has adopted unconventional methods to achieve its record. The Washington Post reported that the administration counted some 19,000 immigrants who had left the previous fiscal year, and the Center for Immigration Studies pointed out that these numbers increased as interior enforcement declined.\n\nObama's attempt to define deportations down notwithstanding, he acknowledged the need for increased enforcement to maintain credibility on amnesty for enforcement exchanges. Now, the Obama administration can curtail deportations if congressional Republicans do not pass an immigration bill.",
    " Title: Extinction Rebellion Protests Disrupt European Cities, Sparking Debate on Climate Change Activism\n\nArticle:\n\nProtesters affiliated with the Extinction Rebellion (XR) group disrupted several European cities, including London, Berlin, and Amsterdam, in recent weeks. The demonstrations, which have resulted in over 1,800 arrests in London alone, have caused significant disruptions to daily life, particularly during rush hour.\n\nThe protests began in London with actions such as spraying beetroot juice on delegates at a fossil-fuels conference, dousing the Treasury building with red paint, and blocking key buildings with breastfeeding mothers. One protester even climbed to the top of Big Ben using scaffolding.\n\nThe most controversial action took place last Thursday, when two activists climbed onto commuter trains during rush hour and blocked their departure. They unfurled a banner that read \"Business as Usual = Death.\" Angry commuters, many of whom could have faced pay deductions for late arrival at work, removed the protesters from the trains, and London Underground staff escorted them away.\n\nAn 83-year-old protester named Phil Kingston also glued himself to a train to stop it, justifying his action by stating, \"I'm a Christian, and it really upsets me to see God's creation being wrecked across the world.\"\n\nPublic opinion in London has turned against the protests, with more than 60% of respondents in snap polls expressing frustration with the disruptions. XR leaders have promised that future protests will \"evolve,\" but the meaning of this remains unclear.\n\nXR co-founder Clare Farrell defended the train action, stating, \"This is what you do when you think that absolutely everything is at stake. What would you do if you knew your children were in a burning building? Well, you would break down the door, wouldn't you? It wouldn't be pretty. You wouldn't be able to do it in a way that everyone said, 'Oh, that was nice and calm.' But it's not. It's an emergency.\"\n\nThe real enablers of XR's extremism are the donors and celebrities who provide the group with funding and publicity, allowing it to attract fanatical followers. Hedge fund billionaire Sir Christopher Hohn, who donated \u00a3200,000 to XR, has a \u00a3730 million stake in the owner of Heathrow Airport, despite the airport's high carbon emissions. Over 100 celebrities, including Benedict Cumberbatch, Jude Law, Bob Geldof, and Sienna Miller, have backed XR, despite their high-carbon lifestyles and the carbon footprint of the industries they are part of.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan has faced criticism for his support of the XR protests, while average London commuters have started pushing back against the disruptions, pointing out that poor, working-class people are most affected if they cannot get to their jobs. Economist Andy Critchlow has criticized energy executives for abdicating their responsibility to defend themselves against XR protesters, while Charles Moore, the author of a three-volume biography of Margaret Thatcher, warns that more pushback is needed to prevent XR from escalating its tactics elsewhere.",
    " Title: House Speaker Paul Ryan Delays Endorsement of Donald Trump, Allowing Republican Party Members Flexibility in Support\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, despite anticipating the Republican primary race to continue for several more weeks, spent the last day refining his stance on the presidential nomination, according to his aides. This decision places him in alignment with other notable Republicans, as Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee, has defied conventional campaign norms throughout the election process.\n\nHistorically, a party nominee has not failed to secure the support of a House speaker or majority leader from their party in modern times. In 1896, Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed ran against William McKinley and made it clear he would not serve as vice president, but ultimately endorsed the nominee. In 1964, Senator Barry Goldwater had to wait for the endorsement of Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois, but Mr. Dirksen eventually provided it, ending the \"stop-Goldwater\" movement.\n\nRyan's remarks caught the Republican party off guard, providing a degree of freedom for party members in their support of Trump's candidacy. Had Ryan issued a forceful endorsement, it would have put pressure on fellow House Republicans to follow his lead, a step many have been reluctant to take.\n\n\"I am not there yet,\" Ryan said. \"And I hope to, though, and I want to. But I think what is required is that we unify the party, and I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee.\" The delay in endorsement allows for a more flexible approach among party members regarding their support for Trump's candidacy.",

The Federal Reserve's emergency relief efforts, announced the previous day, failed to stem the market's downward trajectory.\n\nThe DJIA closed at 21,200.62, having fallen by 9.99% or 2,352.60 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined by 9.43% or 750.25 points, closing at 7,201.80. The S&P 500 also saw a significant drop of 9.5% or 260.74 points, ending the day at 2,480.64.\n\nThis marks the third consecutive day of massive declines, following a single day of gains earlier in the week. The ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak and its impact on the global economy appear to be the primary drivers of investor sentiment.\n\nEbrahim Rahbari, director of global economics at Citi Research, told CNBC that the Federal Reserve's actions may not be sufficient to stabilize market sentiment in the short and long term due to credit concerns and escalating health concerns.\n\nIn addition to the stock market turmoil, the novel coronavirus outbreak has disrupted various American institutions. Broadway has been shut down, major sports events have been canceled, and entire seasons are being put on hold. The airline and travel industries have been particularly hard-hit, with shares of United Airlines, Delta, and American Airlines seeing significant drops.\n\nAirlines started canceling flights following President Trump's decision to ban travel between the U.S. and Europe for the next 30 days. Delta, for example, will temporarily cancel flights between cities like Amsterdam and Orlando, Portland and Salt Lake City, as well as flights to Paris from Cincinnati, Raleigh/Durham, and Indianapolis.\n\nInvestors continued to sell off stocks, with even cryptocurrencies and SaaS shares experiencing significant declines. Slack's earnings failed to excite investors, leading to a sell-off of its equity after hours.\n\nIn this challenging economic climate, there appears to be no silver lining, unless one had shorted oil a month ago. The country is yet to ramp up its COVID-19 testing regime in earnest.",
    " Title: Obama Faces Blame for Looming Sequester as Time Runs Out\n\n Article:\n\nPresident Barack Obama returned to Washington on Monday, with only two weeks remaining to find a solution to avoid the implementation of the $1 trillion in across-the-board cuts known as the sequester, a plan he initially proposed. The sequester, which Obama now labels a \"really bad idea,\" is set to take effect on March 1.\n\nRepublicans, led by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, are emphasizing that the public should direct blame towards the president if the sequester cannot be prevented. \"Don't forget it's the president who proposed the sequester and designed the sequester,\" Ryan said on ABC News' This Week. \"House Republicans twice passed legislation replacing the sequester with smarter cuts in other areas of government.\"\n\nRyan stated that House Republicans are still working on plans to replace the sequester but believes it will occur due to the short timeframe. The Senate has yet to pass a spending bill to replace the sequester, Ryan noted, adding that Obama \"gave a speech showing he'd like to replace it, but he has not put any details out there.\"\n\nIn his State of the Union Address on Feb. 12, the president explained that in 2011, Congress passed a law stating that if both parties could not agree on spending cuts, \"about a trillion dollars worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year.\" Obama described the \"sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts\" as jeopardizing military readiness, devastating priorities like education and energy, and medical research, and slowing the recovery and costing hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nHowever, Ryan argued that the sequester is looming and will likely happen \"because the president back in the last session of congress refused to cut spending in any place and therefore we wound up with the sequester.\"\n\nWhile Ryan has previously stated that he and other conservatives are fighting for statutory caps on spending, he said Sunday he was referring to budget caps on discretionary spending, which were implemented and the party wanted them. \"Everybody wants budget caps,\" Ryan said, pointing out \"the sequester we're talking about now was backing up the supercommittee.\" The committee was supposed to have come up with $1.2 trillion in savings, Ryan said, and Republicans offered even higher revenues in exchange for spending cuts. \"It was rejected by the president and the Democrats,\" Ryan said. \"No resolution occurred and therefore the sequester is occurring.\"\n\nRyan is not the only person who places the blame for the sequester on Obama's shoulders. Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward, sitting on the discussion panel on Fox News Sunday, also stated that the sequester was the White House's idea. \"It was the White House, it was Obama and Jack Lew and Rob Nabors who went to the Democratic leader in the Senate Harry Reid and said this is the solution,\" said Woodward. \"But everyone has their fingerprints on this,\" he added. \"What is important about it is, it is a governing travesty.\"\n\nWoodward continued, \"The idea that you are going to go around and in random ways just cut things, it would be like a family that has to cut their budget, saying, oh, let's cut the medicine that keeps the children alive. It is stupid.\" Woodward said the White House does not dispute proposing the sequester, \"and they really do not want to talk about the origins of the sequester now.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner also blames the White House for the sequester. \"It's taking a meat axe to government spending,\" he said following the State of the Union speech. \"That's why the president ought to be forthcoming about a plan to replace the sequester. His Number Two, Majority Leader Eric Cantor agreed with Boehner that the GOP will do what it can to avoid the cuts kicking in. \"We mean business, Mr. President. We are willing to work with you,\" he said.\n\nThe threat of the sequester starting has been made worse by Congress' decision to take a 10-day President's Day break. It won't return to session until Feb. 25, giving it just four working days to find a solution. Obama spent his weekend playing golf in Florida, including a game with Tiger Woods. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid claims Democrats will issue their answer at some point in that time. \"Democrats believe the right way to eliminate the deficit is to target waste and abuse with smart spending cuts with closing tax loopholes,\" Reid said.\n\nHowever, Reid's decision to hold off, just adds to the brinksmanship that Obama slammed during his address, when he said, \"The greatest nation on Earth can not keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next.\" Obama continued, \"Let's agree, right here, right now, to keep the people's government open, pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America.\" The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another, said the president.",

The awards, which were announced via Twitter, were met with backlash from critics who argue that the president himself is often economical with the truth.\n\nIn June 2017, it was reported that Republicans had won five special elections to the Democrats' nil. However, this was not accurate, as Democrats won one of the five special congressional elections held up to that point in 2017.\n\nIn another instance, it was reported that the U.S. had a $17 billion trade deficit with Canada. This was not the case, as the U.S. actually had a trade surplus with Canada of $8.1 billion in 2016.\n\nThe Amazon Washington Post and NBC were also named as recipients of the \"Fake News\" awards, with the president claiming that the media outlets knowingly do not tell the truth and are a great danger to the country.\n\nOther instances of alleged \"Fake News\" included claims that Colbert's Late Show had the highest rating it had ever had when Donald Trump appeared on it, which was not the case. Additionally, it was reported that President Obama and other U.S. presidents did not make phone calls to the families of U.S. military personnel lost in action, which was also not true.\n\nThe president also claimed that his tax plans would not benefit him, but with the data available from 2005, it was found that Donald Trump paid $31,261,179 in AMT (alternative minimum tax), a tax which is being repealed under Trump's plans.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard was also named as a recipient of the \"Fake News\" award, with the president claiming that the Coast Guard saved more than 15,000 lives during Hurricane Harvey. However, the official life-saving toll was put at just over 11,000.\n\nCNN International was also named as a source of \"Fake News,\" with the president claiming that the network's ratings were \"way down\" when they were not. Politifact assessed that CNN's ratings were at a five-year high.\n\nThe president also claimed that the murder rate in the U.S. was the highest for 47 years, which is not true. Murder rates were higher in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe president's claims of \"Fake News\" have been met with criticism from media outlets and political opponents, who argue that the president's own statements are often inaccurate and misleading. The president has also been criticized for his use of Twitter to spread information and for his attacks on the media.",

It's a victory for American workers, and it's one that we take great pride in advancing.\"\n\nDuring the press conference, Pelosi dismissed the announcement as a victory for the president, saying, \"We came a long way from what he originally proposed. There are some people who would say 'why make it look like he has a victory?' Well, we're declaring victory for the American worker.\"\n\nWays and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) detailed the final days of negotiations, stating, \"This got really hot on a number of occasions,\" but calling the deal a \"transformative agreement\" and \"an opportunity we couldn't let get away from us.\"\n\nAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who represents the largest federation of unions in the country and was a key party in negotiations, confirmed Tuesday that the AFL-CIO would back the trade agreement. Trumka stated, \"Working people are responsible for a deal that is a vast improvement over both the original NAFTA and the flawed proposal brought forward in 2017.\"\n\nThe USMCA overhauls the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and is designed to raise wages and improve working conditions for both Mexican and American auto workers by tightening regulations. The deal will be signed on Tuesday by officials from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted in anticipation of the deal, stating, \"America's great USMCA Trade Bill is looking good.

    " Title: EPA Proposes National Rules to Reduce Sulfur in Gasoline\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed new national rules to reduce the amount of sulfur in gasoline. The aim is to significantly decrease harmful pollution, prevent thousands of premature deaths and illnesses, and improve the efficiency of cars and trucks.\n\nAccording to NPR's Richard Harris, the lower-sulfur gasoline, already in use in California, Europe, and Japan, will help catalytic converters function more effectively and reduce emissions that contribute to smog. If the rule is adopted, gas prices are expected to rise by a penny per gallon, but the oil industry opposes the rule, stating it will add 6 to 9 cents to the cost of a gallon of gasoline. The rule, if adopted, would take effect in 2017.\n\nThe rules have drawn criticism from some Republicans who argue that the mandate will increase consumer costs. The EPA estimates that by 2030, the rules will annually avoid up to 2,400 premature deaths, 23,000 cases of respiratory ailments in children, and other benefits, totaling between $8 billion and $23 billion in yearly health-related benefits. However, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., stated that \"increases in gas prices disproportionately hurt the nation's most vulnerable individuals and families.\"\n\nUSA Today reports that automakers support the proposal, with Gloria Bergquist of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers stating, \"Our cleaner cars will need even cleaner fuels like those already sold across Europe and Asia, and we are pleased EPA is proposing cleaner fuels.\"",
    " Title: Americans' Opinions on Obamacare, Same-sex Marriage, and the Supreme Court\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CNN/ORC poll reveals that 43 percent of Americans approve of Obamacare overall, matching a previous high in 2013, while 55 percent are opposed. Fifty-three percent say it's too soon to make a judgment about the healthcare law. The poll, conducted at the end of May, surveyed 1,025 adults.\n\nOn the issue of same-sex marriage, 63 percent of respondents believe gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to marry, with 49 percent holding this view as recently as 2010. Support for same-sex marriage reaches across most age demographics, including 73 percent of those under age 50 and 52 percent older than 50.\n\nThe poll also shows that Democrats (74 percent) and independents (69 percent) agree that gays have a constitutional right to marry, while only 35 percent of Republicans agree. Republicans under 50 agree on the issue by 59 percent, compared with 36 percent of Republicans older than 50.\n\nSixty-three percent of those who agree on a constitutional right to same-sex marriage say they trust the court at least a moderate amount on the issue, while only 25 percent of those who disagree trust the court.\n\nVoters across party lines agreed that everyone should be eligible for the same subsidies, including Democrats (74/20 percent), independents (56/38 percent), and Republicans (49/41 percent). Sixty-two percent of voters said they would be more likely to vote for someone who works to ensure a universal subsidy level, compared to 28 percent who said they would not.\n\nRepublicans could pay the biggest price, as 41 percent of voters say they'd be less likely to vote for a Republican who didn't vote to fix Obamacare, compared to only 31 percent who say they would be more likely.\n\nThe Supreme Court's trust levels rose on freedom of speech (69 percent), voting rights (65 percent), and the death penalty (60 percent). However, the court's trust levels were worse on healthcare and same-sex marriage, with only about half saying they have at least a moderate amount of trust in the court as it considers those issues.\n\nThe Supreme Court's upcoming decision on the King v. Burwell case could determine the future of Obamacare itself. The plaintiffs in the case argue that President Barack Obama's signature legislation allows only for federal subsidies on state-run exchanges, not for those in states that use the federal exchange. If the court agrees, 7.5 million people in those states could lose their subsidies, driving the price for their insurance policies up too high for them to afford.\n\nThe decision is also coming as many Americans who already do not qualify for coverage have been scrambling to find other ways to afford the mandatory healthcare plans. Many people who purchased the lower-cost silver or bronze individual plans on the exchanges have still seen their premiums and out-of-pocket payments climb from anywhere between 14 percent and 28 percent.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision could also slam Americans who are facing insurance companies' calls for double-digit premium hikes in some states, like New Mexico, where Blue Cross Blue Shield has proposed a 50 percent premium increase for its Obamacare plans.\n\nOn the issue of same-sex marriage, the poll revealed that the court is currently divided on the issue, which is expected to be decided later this month. The court is considering cases from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee, four of the 14 remaining states that allow only heterosexual marriage.\n\nJust 10 years ago, Massachusetts was the first state that allowed same-sex marriages, and as recently as last October, just one-third of states permitted the unions. Now, same-sex couples can marry in 36 states and Washington, D.C., marking a dramatic change in public opinion.\n\nThe CNN/ORC poll also showed that Chief Justice John Roberts' opinion among those polled is still positive, with 33 percent seeing him favorably and 24 percent unfavorably. This is a drop from 41 percent seeing him favorably after the court upheld the Obamacare individual mandate provision, the CNN poll shows. Roberts' decline was most marked among Democrats, with 51 percent of them seeing him favorably in 2012 compared to 35 percent now.",
    " Title: Diplomatic Efforts Aimed at Ending Renewed Fighting in Eastern Ukraine\n\nArticle:\n\nDiplomatic efforts are underway to end renewed fighting in eastern Ukraine, with French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel holding urgent talks in the capital Kiev. The leaders presented a new peace initiative, and US Secretary of State John Kerry, who is also in Kiev, stated that the US wanted a diplomatic solution but would not ignore Russian aggression.\n\nFighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels has resulted in nearly 5,400 deaths since April, according to the United Nations. Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of arming rebels in eastern Ukraine and sending regular troops across the border, while Russia denies direct involvement but acknowledges some Russian volunteers are fighting alongside the rebels.\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko expressed hope for a ceasefire following the talks with Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande. Earlier, he thanked the German and French leaders for their visit at \"a very urgent time.\" The German and French leaders made no public comments after Thursday's meeting, in what appeared to be a speedily arranged visit.\n\nAhead of the talks, Mr. Hollande said he and Mrs. Merkel would present a new peace proposal based on Ukraine's \"territorial integrity,\" which could be \"acceptable to all.\" Mr. Hollande and Mrs. Merkel will now meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Friday.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk stated that the country needs peace but will never consider anything that undermines its territorial integrity. US Secretary of State John Kerry accused Russia of violating Ukraine's sovereignty, stating that Russia had been acting with \"impunity,\" crossing the Ukrainian border \"at will with weapons [and] personnel.\"\n\nThe US is currently only providing \"non-lethal\" assistance, such as night-vision goggles and body armor. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich stated that any decision by the US to supply weapons to Ukraine would \"inflict colossal damage to Russian-American relations.\" Several senior Western officials have also expressed concern at the prospect of US arms being sent to Ukraine.\n\nThe consensus view up to now has been not to supply weapons, but to give non-lethal support like radars, medical gear, body-armor, and so on. Only Poland has explicitly stated that it might arm Ukraine if asked. Now, the balance of the debate is shifting in the US, but there is no clear will to provide weapons to the Kiev government. There is a growing sense of urgency and concern within NATO, and if diplomacy fails, arming Kiev may become a serious option.\n\nA spokesman for the Kremlin said Mr. Putin would discuss \"the fastest possible end to the civil war in south-eastern Ukraine.\" Correspondents say it is not clear how the latest attempt will differ from previous, aborted peace efforts, but there is speculation that Mr. Hollande and Mrs. Merkel hope to discourage the US from supplying Ukraine with weapons.\n\nThe talks in Kiev come as NATO unveils details of a plan to bolster its military presence in Eastern Europe in response to the Ukraine crisis. A new rapid reaction \"spearhead\" force of up to 5,000 troops is expected to be announced, with its lead units able to deploy at two days' notice. NATO is also establishing a network of small command centers in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria.\n\nMeanwhile, officials said on Thursday that the European Union is adding 19 people, including five Russians, to its sanctions list over the Ukraine crisis. Nine \"entities\" will also be targeted by the sanctions, which were reportedly agreed at an emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers last week. Fighting has intensified in eastern Ukraine in recent weeks amid a rebel offensive. The fiercest fighting has been near the town of Debaltseve, where rebels are trying to surround Ukrainian troops. The town is a crucial rail hub linking the rebel-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nSome 1.2 million Ukrainians have fled their homes since last April, when the rebels seized a big swathe of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions following Russia's annexation of Crimea.",
    " Title: GOP Leaders Meet to Discuss Party Unity Amidst Ongoing Tax Return Controversy and Split over Trump's Conservative Credentials\n\nArticle:\n\nA meeting between former President Donald Trump and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is being considered critical as Trump heads to Capitol Hill on Thursday to attempt to unify the Republican Party following a contentious primary election. House Republicans are urging Speaker Ryan to endorse their party's presumptive nominee, but Ryan, who has been hesitant to support Trump, emphasizes the importance of a unified front.\n\n\"To pretend we are unified as a party after coming through a very bruising primary, which just ended a week ago, to pretend to unify without actually unifying, then we go into the fall with half strength,\" Ryan stated.\n\nThe meeting takes place amid ongoing questions regarding Trump's refusal to release his tax returns. Trump has stated that he will not release them until after an Internal Revenue Service audit is completed, which may not occur until after the election. Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has seized on this issue, stating, \"My husband and I have released 33 years of tax returns. So you got ta ask yourself why doesn't he want to release them?\"\n\nIn terms of taxes, Politico reports that Trump has enlisted well-known conservative economists Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore to help him revise his initial tax plan. The plan, according to one group, could potentially add an additional $10 trillion to $12 trillion to America's already burgeoning national debt, while promoting economic growth.\n\nTrump has expressed his intention to ensure the middle class receives good tax breaks and to fight vigorously for businesses.\n\nFurthermore, Trump is reportedly considering former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to head a commission on radical Islam. The commission would study Trump's immigration policies, including his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.\n\nMore than a week after becoming the party's presumptive nominee, there remains a split within the GOP over Trump's conservative credentials. Despite questions about Trump's ability to defeat Clinton in November, a new Reuters poll places Trump and Clinton in a dead heat, with Clinton at 41 percent, Trump at 40 percent, and 19 percent undecided.",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Rallies Conservatives at CPAC, Promises Repeal of Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nVice President Mike Pence addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Thursday, rallying conservatives around President Donald Trump's agenda. In his speech, Pence emphasized the administration's commitment to keeping the promises made to the American people.\n\n\"President Trump is a man of his word, and we're in the promise-keeping business these days,\" Pence told the CPAC audience. He criticized the Democratic Party for making promises they could not fulfill and called for a renewed demonstration that \"our answers are the right answers.\"\n\nPence outlined a four-point agenda: a strong military, more jobs, less taxes, respect for the Constitution, and a deep and abiding faith in the goodness of the American people. Despite former House Speaker John Boehner's statement on Thursday that Republicans would not repeal Obamacare but simply fix it, Pence maintained that the GOP would indeed repeal and replace the healthcare law.\n\n\"President Donald Trump is leading the fight to repeal and replace Obamacare. And let me assure you, America's Obamacare nightmare is about to end,\" Pence said. He added that the American people, despite the efforts of liberal activists, understand that Obamacare has failed and must be abolished.\n\nOther key members of the Trump White House, including top advisers Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus, also spoke to the conservative crowd. Bannon stated that the battles between the media and the administration are far from over, and he predicted that they would worsen.\n\n\"It's not only not going to get better, it's going to get worse every day with the media. And here's why... By the way, the internal logic makes sense\u2014they're corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed, adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has,\" Bannon said.\n\nHe emphasized that the Trump administration would continue to fight and encouraged the audience to hold the president's team accountable for delivering on the promises it has made. The specifics of the Obamacare replacement plan were not detailed in the provided text.",
    " Title: Obama's State of the Union Address: A Repeat of Campaign Proposals and Emphasis on Executive Action\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday night could have been mistaken for a campaign speech from last year, as many of the proposals he presented were repeats of ideas that went unaddressed in a divided Washington during his re-election campaign. The president emphasized a balanced approach to deficit reduction, the need to protect the middle class, and the importance of reigniting \"the true engine of America's economic growth.\"\n\nThe recovery remains weak, with unemployment at 7.9% and the nation's growth rate shrinking in the last three months of 2012. With much of his legacy potentially dependent on helping to reignite the economy, Obama proposed 15 manufacturing hubs to help spur high-tech job growth.\n\nThe president also addressed the impending $85 billion in automatic across-the-board spending cuts set to take effect on March 1, warning that they could lead to a recession. However, he did not offer any ground on what he would accept as an alternative, setting up the next major fiscal fight with Republicans.\n\nFacing hundreds of members of the opposing party, Obama took a decidedly different approach than in his aggressive inaugural address. \"They do expect us to put the nation's interests before party. They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can,\" the president said early in the address.\n\nHe praised some Republicans, such as Sen. John McCain, his 2008 opponent, for their work on climate change, and mentioned his 2012 opponent, Mitt Romney, for his idea of tying the minimum wage to the cost of living.\n\nWhile the president talked about the potential for bipartisan approaches on tax and immigration reform, Republicans may be expected to say they have not seen a different approach from the president on many key issues. The president wants more tax revenues and more government spending on his priorities, which are non-starters among Republicans.\n\nThe proposals Obama floated included making high-quality preschool available to every child, providing tax credits for businesses to hire and invest, promoting more scientific research and development, further shifting cars and trucks away from gasoline, and investing in infrastructure. \"Nothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime,\" he said. \"It's not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.\"\n\nHowever, White House officials refused to put a price tag on the programs or to reveal how, in fact, they would be paid for. They promised more details when the White House's budget proposal is released in a few weeks.\n\nThe president also demonstrated his plans to aggressively use executive actions to push policy if Congress thwarts him. He announced action on climate change and cybersecurity, stating, \"If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will.\" He directed his Cabinet to come up with executive actions to reduce pollution, prepare communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.\n\nAfter efforts dealing with cybersecurity failed to pass Congress, the president signed an executive order to increase information-sharing and to help the private sector develop standards. These moves came after the president last month approved 23 executive actions dealing with gun control.\n\nObama also used the speech to address his base by emphasizing liberal priorities such as climate change and equal treatment and benefits for gay Americans, as well as announcing a bipartisan commission to improve the voting system and pushing for a hike in the minimum wage.\n\nThe White House tried to build up suspense around what the president would say, but as soon as news broke Tuesday afternoon that accused cop-killer Christopher Dorner was believed to be holed up in a cabin in the California mountains, much of the media immediately switched gears. What would have been hours of coverage of the speech, the president's message, and discussion of his agenda did not happen.\n\nWould this be another split-screen State of the Union, similar to when networks flashed news of the verdict in O.J. Simpson's civil trial during Bill Clinton's 1997 address? That did not happen this time, but as soon as Obama wrapped up, most news organizations quickly updated viewers on the Dorner story. However, the president might have gotten an unintended benefit from the other story of the day\u2014interest in Dorner might have helped boost the audience for the address.",
    " Title: Macron, Merkel, and Other Leaders to Launch Global COVID-19 Fight Initiative; US Declines Participation\n\nArticle:\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will join a global initiative to accelerate efforts in fighting COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Friday. However, the United States has declined participation.\n\nThe WHO announced late on Thursday that it would unveil a \"landmark collaboration\" on Friday to expedite the development of safe, effective drugs, tests, and vaccines to prevent, diagnose, and treat COVID-19. WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib revealed this during a United Nations briefing on Friday, stating that Macron, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab, and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres would take part in the 1300 GMT announcement, led by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\nAccording to diplomatic sources, Raab and Guterres will participate in the event. Chaib explained that the aim of the collaboration is to ensure that when new tools become available, no one is left behind, and that those who can afford vaccines or therapeutics will make them accessible to the global population.\n\nA spokesman for the US mission in Geneva confirmed that the United States would not take part in the initiative. \"There will be no US official participation,\" he said in an email response to a query. \"We look forward to learning more about this initiative in support of international cooperation to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 as soon as possible.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump has criticized the WHO for its slow response to the outbreak and for being \"China-centric.\" He announced a suspension of funding. When asked whether the United States would participate in the meeting, a WHO source said, \"No, but almost everyone else is.\"\n\nMore than 2.7 million people have been infected with the disease, which has claimed nearly 190,000 lives since emerging in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, according to a Reuters tally. Over 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, including six already in clinical trials, said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI vaccine alliance, a public-private partnership that leads immunization campaigns in poor countries.\n\n\"We need to ensure that there are enough vaccines for everyone,\" Berkley said during a separate Geneva news briefing before taking part in the formal WHO announcement. \"We are going to need global leadership to identify and prioritize vaccine candidates.\"\n\nGlobal manufacturing capacity must be increased ahead of choosing \"a winner\" vaccine, Berkley said, noting that GAVI and the World Bank are looking at the issue. \"We can't have a repeat of what happened in 2009, the H1N1 vaccine, when there was not enough supply for developing countries or when supply did come, it came much later,\" he said.\n\nAnother important question is how well a vaccine will work in people most at risk from COVID-19, Berkley said. \"How well do they work in the elderly? Are they single or multiple dose etc.?\" he said, noting that older people have weaker immune systems.",
    " Title: North Carolina Democratic Convention Faces Multiple Challenges Ahead of Presidential Nominating Event\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Charlotte, North Carolina, is facing multiple challenges as President Barack Obama prepares to accept his party's nomination. The convention, initially envisioned as a triumphant and unifying event, is being overshadowed by a series of scandals, boycotts, and financial woes.\n\nOne issue arises from an ongoing sexual harassment scandal within the North Carolina Democratic Party (NCDP). In early 2013, former party communications staffer Adriadn Ortega accused former executive director Jay Parmley of repeated sexual harassment and physical groping. Leaked documents revealed a financial settlement involving the two men, leading to Ortega's termination and Parmley's resignation. The party has been embroiled in a crisis since, with local candidates expressing concern about the potential impact on the election.\n\nAnother challenge comes from Democratic officials choosing to boycott the convention to avoid association with President Obama himself. At least seven Democratic representatives, including Bill Owens and Kathy Hochul from New York, Mark Critz from Pennsylvania, and Earl Ray Tomblin, Joe Manchin, and Nick Rahall from West Virginia, have announced they will not attend. The reasons for their boycott range from disagreements on immigration policy to criticisms of Obama's jobs programs and his stance on coal.\n\nThe convention's left-leaning supporters are also expressing dissent. Progressives, who gave Obama a pass during his first term, are critical of the decision to deliver the presidential nomination acceptance speech at Bank of America Stadium. The bank, which received a $45 billion banking bailout in 2008 and an estimated $931 billion in secret federal emergency loans, is a source of contention for some Democrats.\n\nIn addition to these internal challenges, the convention is facing external opposition. Thousands of anarchists, socialists, and professional agitators plan to protest in Charlotte. The DNC's association with Bank of America, a financially troubled bank with a history of political contributions to Obama, is also a point of contention for some progressive Democrats.\n\nThe DNC, initially billed as \"The People's Convention,\" is being criticized for its association with Bank of America and the ongoing scandals within the NCDP. The event promises to be a public relations challenge for Obama's campaign team.",
    " Title: President Obama's Tennessee Visit Met with Criticism Over ACA Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's visit to Tennessee, aimed at celebrating the Supreme Court's upholding of Obamacare subsidies for individuals in states without state-based exchanges, has been met with criticism from Republican Representative Diane Black of Tennessee.\n\nRep. Black, a former nurse, suggested that the president should have researched the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in Tennessee before choosing the state for his visit. In a statement, she criticized the ACA for causing a 36% premium increase for Obamacare customers in the state, contradicting the president's promise of average savings of $2,500 per year for families. She also pointed out the 28,000 Tennesseans who lost their insurance coverage in a single day, despite the president's pledge that individuals could keep their health care plans if they liked them.\n\nA nationwide CNN poll revealed that twice as many Americans were hurt by Obamacare than benefited from it. The impact was particularly felt in Tennessee, where state-sponsored insurance programs, relied on by thousands of residents, were effectively shut down due to the ACA. Families covered by AccessTN, a program for people with pre-existing medical conditions, and by CoverRX, a prescription benefits program, are receiving letters explaining the changes. The 16,000 people enrolled in CoverTN, a limited benefits plan, have already been notified that it will end on December 31. Many families have also received notice that they will no longer be able to buy into CoverKids.\n\nRep. Black's statement underscores the challenges faced by families in Tennessee due to the ACA. The full repeal of the ACA remains a priority for Black and her conservative colleagues.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Budget Deal: A Compromise Between Republicans and Democrats\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recently crafted bipartisan budget deal between Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray has received mixed reviews, with the Los Angeles Times stating that it \"has something for everyone to dislike.\" The deal, which aims to avoid a government shutdown during the Christmas break, has been criticized by both parties.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, the agreement does not cut federal spending or reduce the national debt, which displeases conservative Republicans. On the other hand, it does not restore much funding for domestic programs or extend unemployment insurance, which disappoints Democrats.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that the deal denies both Republicans and Democrats their most desired outcomes. Republicans did not secure any changes to Medicare and Social Security, while Democrats did not receive any new taxes.\n\nNPR's Tamara Keith, on Morning Edition, summarized the agreement as follows: \"The deal...would set the federal budget at just about $1 trillion this year and next. It would replace a big chunk of the sequester cuts with other trims and increased fees. And that's pretty much it.\"\n\nRyan may face challenges in selling the deal to skeptical House conservatives, as reported by The National Journal. However, Ryan, who is known for his fiscal conservatism, seems confident in his ability to persuade his colleagues. During a Tuesday press conference, Ryan emphasized that the agreement reduces the deficit without raising taxes and addresses long-ignored mandatory spending.\n\nThe deal has received varied reactions from other news outlets. Fox News headlined their article as \"Conservative groups sound alarm over tentative budget deal,\" while the Wall Street Journal titled their editorial \"A Least Bad Budget Deal.\" Reuters and The Financial Times published headlines suggesting the deal could usher in a new era of cooperation, while USA Today reported that the House is on track to vote on the deal on Thursday.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, in an interview with Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep, described the agreement as a compromise, stating, \"Neither one of us got everything we wanted and we were able to keep the other person from getting some of the big things they wanted, and that's called compromise.\"",
    " Title: Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey Leaves Conservative Group FreedomWorks Over Disagreements on Future Direction\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. \u2014 Former Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey has left the conservative Tea Party group, FreedomWorks, following a $8 million payout from a prominent GOP fundraiser, according to a contract obtained by The Associated Press. The contract, dated September 24, stipulates that Armey would resign from his role as chairman of both FreedomWorks and its sister organization, the FreedomWorks Foundation, by the end of November.\n\nThe payout, in annual $400,000 installments, is to be provided by Richard J. Stephenson, a board member of FreedomWorks and the founder and chairman of the Cancer Treatment Centers of America, a national cancer treatment network.\n\nArmey's departure comes amidst growing acrimony within conservative and Republican ranks as the party grapples with its November electoral losses and uncertainty over its future direction. Armey confirmed his departure on Tuesday, stating that his departure was a matter of principle. He declined to elaborate on his specific concerns but told the Mother Jones website that the Tea Party group was moving in an unproductive direction.\n\nIn an internal resignation memo published by Mother Jones, Armey requested that FreedomWorks CEO Matt Kibbe remove his name, image, and signature from all group materials and web operations. Kibbe and other FreedomWorks officials were not immediately available for comment.\n\nArmey, who co-founded FreedomWorks in 2004, is a veteran Texas GOP political figure who was intimately involved in the GOP's conservative \"Contract with America\" congressional movement in the 1990s. While Armey, 72, was the group's public face, FreedomWorks' most active official, Matt Kibbe, has been its most visible figure, appearing at FreedomWorks' public gatherings.\n\nFreedomWorks flourished after a wave of Tea Party House candidates swept into office in 2010, but despite spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to back favored GOP candidates in November, the group's influence appeared to wane at the polls. Among the GOP losers supported by FreedomWorks in November were Senate candidates Josh Mandel in Ohio, Connie Mack in Florida, and Richard Mourdock in Indiana.\n\nOverall, Tea Party-influenced House legislators fared better in the recent elections, though their ranks thinned. At least 83 of 87 Republican House members who were allied with Tea Party anti-government spending causes ran for re-election in November, and all but eleven were returned to office. A twelfth, Rep. Jeff Landry (R-La.), faces an uphill runoff election this month against another GOP incumbent.\n\nFreedomWorks' internal secrecy and its role as a high-financed super political action committee became an issue in the weeks before the election when federal campaign finance documents revealed that a shadowy Tennessee-based corporation had funneled seven donations totaling $5.28 million to the Tea Party group. The amount was the largest political contribution to a super PAC in 2012 from a business group that would not identify its donor.\n\nFreedomWorks would not identify the anonymous donor, and a Tennessee lawyer who helped set up the group would also not divulge the head of the firm, Specialty Group Inc. The Tennessee firm later changed its name to Specialty Investments Group Inc. on November 28.",
    " Title: \"Clinton Ally's Political Organization Aids Campaign of FBI Official's Wife\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a development that has sparked renewed Republican criticism, a top political ally of Hillary Clinton's donated nearly half a million dollars to the campaign of the wife of an FBI official who would later oversee part of the investigation into Clinton's email practices. The revelation, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, has fueled fresh complaints about the investigation's integrity.\n\nAt a rally in Florida on Monday, Donald Trump cited the findings, stating, \"We've never had a thing like this in the history of this country.\" The Journal reported that Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's Political Action Committee (PAC) donated $467,500 to Dr. Jill McCabe's 2015 state Senate campaign. The Virginia Democratic Party also contributed an additional $207,788 to the campaign, according to the Journal.\n\nDr. McCabe, who lost to Republican incumbent Dick Black, is married to Andrew McCabe, the FBI's deputy director. At the time of the campaign and of McAuliffe's support, McCabe was an associate deputy director. He was later promoted to deputy after the campaign ended, assuming an oversight role in the Clinton email investigation.\n\nMcCabe reportedly sought ethics guidance from the FBI and followed it, but his supervision of the email case was not seen as a potential conflict since Jill McCabe's campaign was over, and McAuliffe was not directly involved in the email case. The FBI's \"Ethics and Integrity Program\" manual makes clear that McCabe would have had to flag the connections to senior management, and the final decision would come in writing.\n\nIn the section prohibiting employees from participating in criminal investigations in certain cases where there's a personal or political relationship, the manual states that an exception would be if \"The employee's participation would not create an appearance of a conflict of interest to affect the public perception of the integrity of the investigation or prosecution.\"\n\nThe FBI, in a statement, confirmed that McCabe sought internal guidance \"to prevent against any actual or potential conflict-of-interest\" and when his wife chose to run, \"McCabe and FBI lawyers implemented a system of recusal from all FBI investigative matters involving Virginia politics, a process followed for the remainder of her campaign.\" During the campaign, he played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind.\n\nHowever, a law enforcement official acknowledged an optics issue, given that while McCabe was barred from investigations into Virginia politics, the donation did come from the Virginia governor.\n\nMcAuliffe and other state figures reportedly recruited Dr. McCabe to run in the first place, but a spokesman pushed back on any suggestion of impropriety. McAuliffe \"supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors... Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous,\" the spokesman told the Journal.\n\nMcCabe continues to be involved in the email investigation aftermath. He was recently asked to brief House Oversight Committee members on allegations \u2013 contained in newly released FBI files \u2013 that a State Department official offered a \"quid pro quo\" with the bureau in a bid to un-classify a particular server email.\n\nThe revelations in the Wall Street Journal report could dovetail with Donald Trump's persistent claims that the Justice Department and FBI investigation into Clinton's email use was compromised. Trump has repeatedly complained about Attorney General Loretta Lynch meeting with Bill Clinton on a Phoenix tarmac days before the FBI announced no charges in its Clinton investigation.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that the funding looked like a \"down payment\" to influence the FBI probe. \"Given all we know about how the corrupt Clinton machine operates, it's hard not to see this as anything other than a down payment to influence the FBI's criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server,\" Priebus said.\n\nAccording to the same report, the PAC and Virginia Democratic Party money amounted to more than a third of Dr. McCabe's campaign funds.

    " Title: Congress Fails to Act on Sequestration Cuts as Finger-Pointing and Political Blame Intensifies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a day of political maneuvering and finger-pointing, Congress failed to take any significant action on the impending $85 billion in forced spending cuts, known as sequestration. The cuts, set to take effect in four days, were the main topic of discussion as members of Congress returned from their week-long recess.\n\nThere were no votes scheduled until the late afternoon, with the GOP-controlled House focusing on a bill to rename a NASA flight research center at Southern California's Edwards Air Force Base after Neil Armstrong, the late astronaut who was the first man to step foot on the moon. The bill is sponsored by House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-California).\n\nIn the Democratic-controlled Senate, members were scheduled to vote on the nomination of a new judge for the 10th Circuit.\n\nDespite the lack of action on the sequestration issue, there were numerous accusations and finger-pointing throughout the day. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) appeared on CNN and stated that there was not enough time to work out a deal, saying, \"So sequestration is going to happen.\" He added, \"We do not need new taxes to run the government, we need new taxes to get out of debt.\"\n\nSpeaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and other House GOP leaders met with reporters on Capitol Hill, stepping up their effort to blame President Barack Obama for the unpopular cuts. Boehner stated, \"The president proposed [these cuts]. And yet he's far more interested in holding campaign rallies than he is in urging his Senate Democrats to actually pass a plan.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) responded by warning that 70,000 kids would be kicked out of the Head Start program if the planned governmentwide cuts are set in motion. He also stated that air traffic controllers, FBI, and border patrol agents will be placed on furlough.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) took to the House floor to argue that while many \"Republicans have been praising the sequester as a viable path forward, Democrats recognize this mindless policy for the danger it is.\" Hoyer urged Republicans to either work with the Democrats or \"abandon this reckless policy.\"\n\nOne development to watch closely is that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, are expected to introduce their own bills for replacing the cuts early this week. It remains to be seen whether this will be more political posturing or the start of a bipartisan effort to give Obama more flexibility in implementing the cuts.",
    " Title: Over 750 Arrested During Opposition Protest in Moscow Ahead of City Council Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nMore than 779 individuals were arrested during a demonstration in Moscow on Saturday, according to OVD-Info, a Russian organization that monitors political arrests. The protest, organized by opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, was held outside city hall, where demonstrators were calling for fair elections following the exclusion of opposition candidates from the upcoming city council elections on Sept. 8.\n\nThe Moscow police initially reported 295 arrests but did not provide a final figure until later. The protest was reportedly unauthorized by the government, and people were seen clashing with police officers and shouting slogans such as \"Russia will be free!\" and \"Who are you beating?\"\n\nOpposition politician Ilya Yashin was among those arrested, with his Facebook page stating that 10 masked officers took him from his apartment in Moscow the night before the demonstration. Navalny, who was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in jail on Wednesday, posted on Instagram, \"I have been detained and am now at a police station wearing shorts like a stupid man.\"\n\nThe opposition politicians' names were reportedly not included on the ballot because they had not received enough signatures to qualify, according to election officials. Supporters of the opposition party argue that the government is forcing them out, preventing their participation in the elections.\n\nHelmeted police reportedly barged into Navalny's video studio during a YouTube broadcast of the protest and arrested program leader Vladimir Milonov. Police also searched Dozhd, an internet TV station covering the protest, and its editor in chief Alexandra Perepelova was ordered to undergo questioning at the Investigative Committee.\n\nThe exact charges the detainees may face remain unclear. The September vote for Moscow's city council, which has 45 seats, has become a significant event in Russia's political scene, as the Kremlin grapples with opposing views in its capital of 12.6 million. The city council, responsible for a large municipal budget, is currently controlled by the pro-Kremlin United Russia party. All of its seats, which have a five-year term, are up for grabs in the Sept. 8 vote.\n\nOver 22,000 people gathered for a protest in downtown Moscow last Saturday, marking one of the largest demonstrations in years.",
    " Title: Senate Panel Endorses Hagel for Pentagon Leadership in Party-Line Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee narrowly endorsed Chuck Hagel's nomination to lead the Pentagon on Tuesday in a 14-11 vote that underscored intense Republican opposition to his nomination. The vote advanced Hagel to the floor for a final decision, with all Republicans present voting against him.\n\nHagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, is a twice-wounded Vietnam War combat veteran. His supporters lauded his service, while critics pointed to his history of controversial votes and statements regarding Iran, Israel, terror groups, the Iraq war, and other issues.\n\nRepublican lawmakers had various reasons for opposing Hagel or trying to hold up his nomination. Some wanted him to provide more financial background information. Others voiced interest in holding up the nomination until the administration provides more information about the Benghazi terror attack, while voicing concerns about Hagel's background as well.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized Hagel's performance during his confirmation hearing, stating, \"His performance before this committee was the worst that I have seen for any nominee for office.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also opposed Hagel, saying, \"There are very few people who have been this wrong about so many things.\"\n\nDemocratic Chairman Carl Levin, however, pushed for a vote just hours before President Obama was set to deliver his State of the Union address. \"The time has come for the committee to act on this nomination,\" Levin said.\n\nObama tapped Hagel, 66, to succeed Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who is stepping down after four years as CIA director and Pentagon chief. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, is pressing for a full Senate vote later this week, most likely on Thursday.\n\nHagel now faces Republican delaying tactics in the full Senate, with the panel's top Republican, Sen. Jim Inhofe, insisting that any confirmation be based on 60 votes rather than a majority of the 100-member Senate. However, this effort has divided Republicans, with several longtime members opposed to the unprecedented step of stalling, or filibustering, a president's Cabinet nominee for Defense secretary.\n\nLate Monday, McCain met privately with several committee Republicans and urged them not to filibuster the Hagel nomination, pointing out that the roles could be reversed someday with a Republican president and Republican-controlled Senate. \"I'm encouraging my colleagues if they want to vote against Sen. Hagel that's one thing and that's a principled stand,\" McCain told a group of reporters. \"We do not want to filibuster. We have not filibustered a Cabinet appointee in the past and I believe that we should move forward with his nomination, bring it to the floor and vote up or down.\"\n\nAll 55 Democrats are expected to back Hagel, and two Republicans\u2014Sens. Thad Cochran and Mike Johanns\u2014have said they will vote for the nominee. At least five Republicans, including McCain, have said they oppose a filibuster despite their reservations or opposition toward the nominee. More than a dozen Republicans have said they will oppose their former colleague, and several others have indicated they are likely to vote no. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican member of the Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday she would vote against the nominee, citing his performance at his confirmation hearing.",
    " Title: Republican Party Elders Express Concern Over Conservative Lawmakers' Shutdown Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nA split among Republicans is becoming increasingly apparent in town hall meetings across the country, with the focus on a strategy by a new group of conservative lawmakers to shut down the federal government in protest of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. This strategy, primarily championed by lawmakers elected in the past few years, has exposed a rift in the GOP about how best to deal with the controversial health care law a year before the 2014 elections.\n\nThe plan, more of a bargaining strategy, is not supported by a critical mass of Republicans, even as 13 lawmakers have signed a letter pledging opposition to any spending bill that does not defund the health law. To be successful, supporters of a government shutdown would need almost every Republican in the Senate to join their effort.\n\nThe GOP establishment is undoubtedly against a shutdown, with many of them becoming more vocal about it. Former 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney this week at a New Hampshire fundraiser expressed concern about the possibility of a shutdown, stating that it would result in Medicare benefits being skipped and troops not getting paid. Arizona Sen. John McCain said on the conservative Michael Medved radio show last month that most Americans are tired of such Washington shenanigans.\n\nProminent conservative opinion maker, columnist Charles Krauthammer, called the idea \"nuts.\" Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, who has shown a willingness to disrupt government if he disagrees with something, told the Washington Examiner that a shutdown could cost Republicans control of the House. His Oklahoma colleague, Rep. Tom Cole, said on Fox News that shutting down the government would be like a legislative \"temper tantrum.\"\n\nHowever, there is evidence that many in the outspoken party base would seriously disagree. Tea party activists have posted a video critical of freshman North Carolina Rep. Rob Pittenger, who drew jeers when he said during a town hall event in his district this week that the party should not shut the government down. In an interview with CNN's Jim Acosta on Wednesday, Pittenger defended his decision to stand against tea party activists who called for a shutdown to defund Obamacare.\n\nBut Pittenger appears to be an exception as a younger lawmaker standing against shutdown proponents. \"The reality is, if we're willing to take a government shutdown unless we repeal Obamacare,... we will lose that vote and Obamacare will survive it,\" Pittenger said. \"Why would we go about a strategy that is doomed to failure?\"\n\nSeeking to find middle ground in the party, a separate group of conservatives, including anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, have suggested instead to use the threat of shutdown to force a one-year delay in implementing the law in place of pursuing a full repeal.\n\nBacklash against Obamacare helped propel Republicans to take back control of the House in 2010. However, exhaustive efforts since to repeal it have been ineffective. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the leader of the shutdown effort, was elected in 2010 after defeating longtime Republican Sen. Bob Bennett in the primary.\n\nWhile Lee's proposal to shut down the government is not embraced by establishment Republicans, it has drawn praise from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, two conservative stars who are believed to be considering runs for president in 2016. Both also, like Lee, defeated more establishment GOP candidates on their way to Washington in 2010.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has not taken a definitive position on the shutdown plan, is now facing a primary challenge in his bid for reelection in Kentucky. Add to all of this the default, shutdown, economic calamity show that has been a Washington rerun due to a string of battles over the federal borrowing limit and government spending. These conservative newcomers to Washington have seen the White House make dire warnings about how the recent forced spending cuts, known formally as sequestration, would have a negative effect on the government and military.\n\nHowever, months later, the forced spending cuts have been largely swept out of the news, and the federal government\u2014from the Pentagon to the Health and Human Services Department\u2014has shown an ability to absorb it for now. Cruz recently argued in a speech at the Heritage Foundation that shutting down the government would not be that bad and could help the GOP. \"There are some Democrats, some in the media, and some Republicans who portray a shutdown as a horrible calamity,\" Cruz said. \"I think the term'shutdown' is a misnomer. It's actually a partial, temporary shutdown. We have seen them before.\"\n\nCruz argued that Saturday and Sunday are kind of like government shutdowns. However, it is Romney, who has acknowledged that he's probably the last person Republicans are now looking to for advice, who gave the most earnest argument on Tuesday against shutting down the government. \"I badly want Obamacare to go away, and stripping it of funds has appeal,\" said Romney, according to a prepared text of his remarks at the private fundraiser. \"But we need to exercise great care about any talk of shutting down government. What would come next...what would come next when soldiers are not paid, when seniors fear for their Medicare and Social Security, and when the FBI is off duty? I'm afraid that in the final analysis, Obamacare would get its funding, our party would suffer in the next elections, and the people of the nation would not be happy.\"\n\nA spokesman for Cruz responded to Romney on Wednesday, arguing that Americans see Obamacare as \"a train wreck.\" \"They expect their elected representatives to fight to undo it,\" said Cruz spokesman Sean Ruston. \"If Republicans stand up for principle, we can win this debate.\"",
    " Title: Judge Kavanaugh Accepts President Trump's Nomination to the Supreme Court\n\nArticle:\n\nBrett Kavanaugh, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, accepted President Trump's nomination to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court on July 9. Kavanaugh's family, including his wife Ashley, daughters Margaret and Liza, his mother Martha, and father Ed, were present at the White House for the announcement.\n\nKavanaugh, in his speech, highlighted his 28-year career as a lawyer, primarily in public service. He discussed his 12-year tenure as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals and his five-year service in the White House for President George W. Bush. Kavanaugh emphasized his long-standing record of advancing and promoting women, with a majority of his 48 law clerks being women and his history of coaching girls' basketball teams.\n\nKavanaugh stated that a good judge should be an \"umpire\" - a neutral and impartial arbiter who does not favor any political party, litigant, or policy. He explained that he has ruled for both prosecution and criminal defendants, workers and businesses, environmentalists, and coal miners, following the law in each case. Kavanaugh stated that he is not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge, nor is he a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. He is, according to Kavanaugh, a \"pro-law judge.\"\n\nKavanaugh emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary, stating that the Supreme Court is the last line of defense for the separation of powers and the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. He stressed that the Supreme Court should not be viewed as a partisan institution, and if confirmed, he would be a team player, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n\nDuring the confirmation process, Kavanaugh met with 65 senators, participated in more than 30 hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and submitted written answers to nearly 1,300 additional questions. Kavanaugh was subjected to allegations that he stated were wrongful and sometimes vicious, which affected his family and led to vile and violent threats against his wife and daughters.\n\nKavanaugh testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend his family, his good name, and his lifetime of public service. His testimony reflected his frustration at being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct contrary to his record and character. Kavanaugh stated that he was emotional during the hearing, and he might have been too emotional at times.\n\nKavanaugh concluded by reaffirming his commitment to being the same kind of judge and person he has been for his entire 28-year legal career: hardworking, even-keeled, open-minded, independent, and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good. He emphasized his respect for colleagues and litigants and his reputation for courtesy on and off the bench. Kavanaugh stated that he will continue to be the same kind of judge he has been for the last 12 years and will continue to contribute to the country as a coach, volunteer, and teacher. He expressed his optimism and commitment to seeing the day that is coming, not the day that is gone.\n\nKavanaugh reiterated his reverence for the Constitution and his belief in an independent and impartial judiciary as essential to the constitutional republic. If confirmed by the Senate to serve on the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh pledged to keep an open mind in every case and always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law.",
    " Title: U.S. Military Reports Failed Attempt to Strike Iranian Commander in Yemen\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. military reportedly attempted, but failed, to carry out an airstrike targeting Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Abdul Reza Shahlai in Yemen on the same night as the successful airstrike that eliminated Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian Quds force, in Iraq.\n\nU.S. military officials, speaking anonymously, confirmed the unsuccessful strike against Shahlai, a key figure in financing the Iranian military force. The State Department has stated that Shahlai \"has a long history of targeting Americans and U.S. allies globally,\" and planned multiple assassinations of coalition forces in Iraq. His activities were said to include providing weapons and explosives to Shia militia groups and directing a plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington eight years ago.\n\nThe revelation of the failed strike comes as the Trump administration is defending the military necessity of the strike in the face of skepticism from Democrats and even some Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nPentagon spokesperson Navy Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, in a statement to The Washington Post, which first reported the second mission, said, \"We have seen the report of a January 2 airstrike in Yemen, which is long understood as a safe space for terrorists and other adversaries to the United States.\" Cmdr. Rebarich declined to discuss the operation or confirm the failed strike.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper, in a tweet on Friday afternoon, avoided explicitly addressing reports of the failed strike but said, \"I want the American people to rest assured knowing they have the best military in the world. As we defend our people and interests in the Middle East, we continue to call on Iran to de-escalate the situation and cease its malign activities throughout the region.\"",
    " Title: Trump Presides Over First Security Council Session, Iran Policy Tensions Expected\n\nArticle:\n\nDonald Trump will preside over his first United Nations Security Council session today, with Iran policy expected to be a primary point of contention. The US president's efforts to isolate Iran and his rejection of globalism are likely to face determined opposition from fellow leaders.\n\nThe US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, has predicted the session to be \"the most watched security council meeting ever.\" However, it may further deepen perceptions of Trump's increasing isolation on the world stage, following the UN General Assembly's open laughter at Trump's boasts about his achievements.\n\nUS allies, including the UK's Prime Minister, Theresa May, and French President, Emmanuel Macron, side with Russia and China in their opposition to Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. They are uneasy about US saber-rattling towards Tehran.\n\nFrench President Macron, in his own address to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, presented himself as an alternative leader of the western world, flatly rejecting Trump's appeal for national \"patriotism\" to take precedence over multilateral action.\n\n\"Nationalism always leads to defeat,\" Macron said. \"If courage is lacking in the defense of fundamental principles, international order becomes fragile and this can lead, as we have already seen twice, to global war. We saw that with our very own eyes.\"\n\nWhile Trump's address was met with a mix of laughter, murmurs, long periods of silence, and polite applause at the end, Macron's speech was given a rapturous reception.\n\nTrump is chairing the meeting because the US currently holds the rotating presidency of the security council. The original plan was to devote the session to Iran, to allow Trump to highlight Iran's role in the Syrian and Yemeni conflict, its missile developments, and the full range of what Washington calls Tehran's malign activities.\n\nHowever, the administration came to fear that this would also highlight the transatlantic rifts over the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew in May, as his fellow leaders are equally determined to speak in defense of the agreement. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, would also have had a right to attend and to speak in a session exclusively about his country.\n\nThe subject of Wednesday's session has therefore been widened to counter-proliferation, including North Korea, but Iran is still likely to be a central point of contention.\n\nThe Trump administration has set out its campaign against Iran at the UN General Assembly, producing a special booklet, \"Outlaw Regime,\" chronicling Iran's \"destructive activities.\"\n\nThe US sent several senior officials to a conference organized by anti-Tehran activists, United Against a Nuclear Iran (UANI), to denounce the Iranian government. The national security adviser, John Bolton, issued a series of threats, saying that Iran would \"have 'hell to pay' if it does not change its behavior.\"\n\nBolton singled out the commander of the external arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Qassem Soleimani, who has led the Iranian military campaign in Syria in support of the Assad regime, and IRGC operations in Iraq.\n\n\"We will use every tool available to pursue Soleimani and others like him,\" Bolton said. \"Iran's leadership will no longer enjoy a life of security and luxury while their people suffer and starve.\"\n\nBolton stressed that the campaign against Soleimani would focus on funding and arms supplies. However, asked for clarification later, the US envoy on Iran and the head of the state department Iran Action Group, Brian Hook, did not rule out military action. Asked what Bolton meant by using \"every available tool\" against Soleimani, Hook said: \"I think it speaks for itself.\"\n\n\"So, looking at Iraq with Soleimani, the IRGC is responsible for so much violence and bloodshed in the Middle East, and as part of restoring our deterrence, we will be focusing on him and his operations,\" Hook said.\n\nIn his own remarks to the UANI conference, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said that an Iranian-backed militia was responsible for rocket attacks against the US embassy compound in Baghdad and the US consulate in Basra, in southern Iraq. He warned that the US would respond directly against Iran in the event of another such attack from Iran, or a militia deemed to be an Iranian proxy.\n\n\"The United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to our facilities. America will respond swiftly and decisively in defense of American lives, and we will respond against the source of the attack on American interests,\" Pompeo said.\n\nThe National Iranian American Council condemned the administration's rhetoric, noting Bolton's role in the buildup to the ill-fated Iraq invasion in 2003.\n\n\"No serious person believes that Bolton and this administration is working towards a diplomatic end with Iran,\" the NIAC statement said. \"He earned his credentials in the Bush White House as an Iraq war architect, he made his intentions for war with Iran well-known as a private citizen, and he is now putting that plan into action.\"",
    " Title: FBI Team Deployed to Aid Investigation of Lebanese Intelligence Official's Assassination\n\nArticle:\n\nAn FBI team is en route to Lebanon to assist in the investigation of the assassination of Brigadier General Wissam al-Hassan, a top Lebanese intelligence official, who was killed in a car bombing last week. The assassination has triggered sporadic clashes across Lebanon.\n\nAccording to a lawmaker, Ahmad Fatfat, al-Hassan was on his way to discuss a recent threat allegedly linked to Syria when he was assassinated last Friday. The car bomb killed al-Hassan, a bodyguard, and a bystander, 30 minutes before he was to meet with Lebanese lawmaker Amar Houri to discuss a threatening text message sent to the lawmaker from a Syrian phone number. Similar threats had been sent via text message to three other lawmakers, including Fatfat, although they did not realize it until after al-Hassan's assassination. All four are members of Lebanon's Future Movement, the largest member of the vocally anti-Syrian March 14 political coalition led by Saad Hariri.\n\nAfter al-Hassan's assassination, Fatfat said he and his colleagues received another text from a similar phone number threatening further killings: \"Congratulations, the countdown has started,\" the text read. \"One of ten.\"\n\nAl-Hassan, who was killed along with a bodyguard and a bystander, was an icon among many fellow Sunni Muslims for his leadership and efforts in rooting out those responsible for targeted killings in Lebanon. However, he angered others, especially those backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and many affiliated with Hezbollah, the Shiite militant and political movement that has a prominent role in Lebanon's government. The U.S. government labels it a terrorist organization. Hezbollah is widely popular with many of Lebanon's Shiite Muslims.\n\nThe lawmakers had told al-Hassan about the threatening texts they had received before Friday's attack, and al-Hassan had agreed to meet with one of them Friday to discuss the details.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday that an FBI team will be sent to Lebanon to assist in the investigation into al-Hassan's death.\n\nSince the assassination, sporadic fighting has erupted across Lebanon, threatening to plunge the country into chaos and raising fears that it could be drawn into the bloody 19-month-old civil war in neighboring Syria. After al-Hassan's funeral Sunday, angry protesters clashed with security forces and rushed toward the prime minister's office, calling for his dismissal.\n\nBy midday Monday, at least three people had been killed in the northern city of Tripoli, while another person was killed in the southern city of Sidon, and another killed in Beirut, Lebanon's official National News Agency reported. More than two dozen people were injured nationwide.\n\nAmid the unrest, the youth wing of the March 14 coalition called for a peaceful rally in Beirut's Martyrs' Square on Monday evening. The March 14 movement is an anti-Syrian coalition that emerged after the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. His son, Saad, leads the coalition.\n\nSyria has condemned the attack but that has not stopped accusations it is behind Friday's killing, which marked the country's highest-profile assassination in more than seven years. The United States has also condemned the attack and vowed to assist in investigating the bombing.",

The protesters displayed signs reading \"Delta: one job should be enough.\"\n\nEight airline workers were arrested by airport officers for refusing to move. Tlaib, though, was not arrested, according to union officials.\n\nIn a statement, Tlaib expressed solidarity with the workers, stating, \"The airline catering workers are desperate for a better quality of life and put their bodies on the line in their fight against the exorbitant corporate greed by the airlines, denying them of their right to a living wage and good healthcare.\"\n\nTlaib continued, \"Working people in the kitchens at DTW and airports across the U.S. have been hurting for too long, but today we are saying no more. Today, we are calling on Delta Air Lines to say that if it wants to really prove that it cares about the working families more than it does its bottom line, than it will commit to ending poverty in the airline catering industry so one job is enough for all airline workers.\"\n\nThe protest took place as Delta Air Lines distributed $1.6 billion in profit-sharing to its employees on the same day. Delta did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\nProtests also occurred in other key Delta hubs in Minneapolis and Seattle, as well as United and American hubs in Boston, Charlotte, Dallas, Honolulu, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco.\n\nUnite Here Local 24 President Nia Winston, who was among those arrested at Metro Airport, said the airline catering industry workers help to make DTW one of the best airports in the country, but cannot afford to take their children to the doctor.\n\n\"Until airlines like Delta recognize all the workers whose labor contributes to its record-profits, until airline catering workers get what they deserve in a fair contract, we will keep coming out at the airport and anywhere else Delta will hear us,\" Winston said.",
    " Title: U.S. Congress Agrees on Sanctions Legislation Targeting Russia, Iran, and North Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. lawmakers have reached an agreement on legislation that imposes new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea. According to congressional Democrats, the bill aims to limit any potential effort by President Donald Trump to ease sanctions against Moscow.\n\nThe Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act, which was passed by the Senate a month ago, was initially held up in the House of Representatives due to Republican proposals to include North Korea sanctions in the bill. The House is scheduled to vote on Tuesday on a package of bills covering sanctions for all three countries.\n\nThe proposed bill requires President Trump to submit a report on proposed actions that would significantly alter U.S. foreign policy in relation to Russia, including easing sanctions or returning diplomatic properties in Maryland and New York that were vacated by former President Barack Obama in December. Congress would then have at least 30 days to hold hearings and vote to approve or reject Trump's proposed changes.\n\nMany lawmakers hope the bill will send a message to Trump to maintain a strong stance against Russia. Trump, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Group of 20 summit earlier this month and described the meeting as an \"honor,\" has been criticized for seeking to improve U.S.-Russian relations. His administration has been embroiled in ongoing investigations of possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia.\n\nThe bill is intended to punish Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea, a peninsula belonging to Ukraine, and for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Putin has denied any meddling in the U.S. democratic process last year. Trump has stated that his campaign did not collude with Russia.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi described Russia's \"outrageous and unacceptable\" behavior in the 2016 U.S. election and in Europe as demanding \"strong statutory sanctions enacted as soon as possible.\" However, she expressed concerns that including North Korea in the legislation could lead to procedural delays in the Senate.\n\nSenior Republican lawmakers did not immediately comment on the latest bill. In Brussels, the European Union expressed concern about the U.S. moves to strengthen sanctions on Russia, urging coordination with its Group of 7 partners. The European Commission warned of potentially \"wide and indiscriminate\" unintended consequences, notably on the EU's efforts to diversify energy sources away from Russia.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Ed Royce, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that the revised bill helps \"bolster the energy security of our European allies by maintaining their access to key energy resources outside of Russia.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer stated that a strong sanctions bill \"is essential,\" and expects \"the House and Senate will act on this legislation promptly, on a broad bipartisan basis.\" Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the agreement was reached after \"intense negotiations.\"\n\n\"A nearly united Congress is poised to send President Putin a clear message on behalf of the American people and our allies,\" Cardin said in a statement. \"We need President Trump to help us deliver that message.\"",

The demonstrations show no signs of abating after more than five months.\n\nIn the central new town of Sha Tin, pro-democracy protesters vandalized a train station and a restaurant perceived as pro-Beijing. Violence also spilled out onto the streets of Tuen Mun, with running battles between riot police and protesters outside the \"V city\" mall.\n\nNow TV reported that one of its reporters was hit by a tear gas canister in Tsuen Wan, west of the New Territories, where police fired tear gas late into the evening to clear the streets. The rail station in Sha Tin was closed due to scuffles between police and protesters, young and old, on a day of planned shopping mall protests throughout the territory.\n\nProtesters daubed graffiti and damaged shops at Festival Walk in Kowloon Tong and \"stormed\" stores in Tsuen Wan, according to police. The violence spread to the Kowloon district of Mong Kok, one of the world's most densely populated areas.\n\nPolice used water cannon and volley after volley of tear gas to try to clear the main artery of Nathan Road, which was littered with loose bricks under the bright, neon lights. Police also fired tear gas late at night in the New Territories district of Tai Po, north of Sha Tin.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they see as police brutality and meddling by Beijing in the former British colony's freedoms, guaranteed by the \"one country, two systems\" formula in place since the territory returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nChina denies interfering and has blamed Western countries for stirring up trouble. Thousands of people gathered at a Saturday night vigil for a student who died in a hospital this week after falling from a car park during a protest.\n\nThousands also gathered in Chater Garden, in Central on Hong Kong island, to mourn the student, Chow Tsz-lok, 22. Pastor Yuen Tin Yau said Chow's family had decided to donate his organs.\n\nSeven pro-democracy city lawmakers have been detained or face arrest and are due to appear in court on Monday on charges of obstructing a May meeting of the local assembly, according to police and several of the lawmakers.\n\nOne of the arrested lawmakers, Gary Fan, said the detentions were the result of \"political prosecutions and judicial crackdowns\" by Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam. The colony of Hong Kong island and the Kowloon peninsula, acquired after two \"opium wars\" with China, was expanded to include the much larger, rural New Territories on a 99-year lease in 1898. Britain returned all the land to China when that lease expired in 1997.\n\nProtesters have called for a general strike on Monday and urged people to block public transport, although such calls in the past have often come to nothing. They have also demanded an independent inquiry into police tactics, something Lam has refused. A five-member international panel said an analysis of the Hong Kong police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council, indicated a shortfall in its \"independent investigative capability\" to look into policing during the protests.",
    " Title: Senate Opposition to Rex Tillerson's Nomination as Secretary of State: A Potential Departure from Republican Orthodoxy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe nomination of Rex Tillerson, CEO of ExxonMobil, as the U.S. Secretary of State by President Donald Trump has sparked controversy, with several Republican senators expressing concerns about Tillerson's ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, Arizona Sen. John McCain, and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham have voiced doubts about Tillerson's nomination, with Rubio referring to Tillerson as a \"Friend of Vladimir,\" a reference to Putin's highest accolade for foreigners. McCain called Putin a \"murderer, a thug, and a KGB agent,\" while Graham also expressed grave doubts about the nominee.\n\nThe potential for Senate rejection of Tillerson's nomination on the floor is a possibility, given the GOP's 52-seat majority. Tillerson's ties to Putin and his lack of government experience have raised concerns among some senators, particularly those who are critical of Trump's defense of Putin and his divergence from the Republican Party's longstanding commitment to NATO.\n\nEnvironmental groups and government watchdogs have also criticized Tillerson's nomination, citing his ties to the fossil fuel industry and potential conflicts of interest. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called Tillerson's nomination \"very troubling\" and \"very dangerous,\" while the Environmental Defense Fund said Trump was putting the oil-and-gas industry's interests above Americans' health.\n\nDespite the criticism, Tillerson's nomination makes sense in a Trumpian world, as he breaks the mold of diplomats and politicians who typically command the U.S. State Department. Tillerson has no government experience, but that is not disqualifying in the Trump administration.\n\nTillerson and Trump are two tough-minded corporate businessmen who have spent decades atop large companies with global interests. Both have a penchant for big projects and a professed devotion to the works of philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand. Tillerson's nomination may signal a redefinition of the Russia relationship, with Trump potentially pursuing a combination of Tillerson's diplomatic skills and a hard-line, old-fashioned Cold Warrior.\n\nThe confirmation hearings for Tillerson's nomination are likely to feature discussions about his stance on U.S.-NATO sanctions on Russia, as well as his views on climate change and alternative energies. Tillerson's nomination has drawn predictable pushback from environmental groups and government watchdogs, but it remains to be seen whether he will face significant opposition in the Senate.",
    " Title: Christian Students Seek Supreme Court Review Over Free Speech Rights on Campus\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo Christian students, Chike Uzuegbunam and Joseph Bradford, have petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review a lawsuit against Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC), alleging that the college's speech zone and speech code policies violated their First Amendment rights. The students, represented by the religious rights law firm Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), claim that these policies prevented them from exercising their freedom of speech and freedom of religion.\n\nIn 2016, Uzuegbunam attempted to distribute religious literature on the GGC campus but was told to stop by a campus security officer, who informed him that he was not allowed to distribute materials at the location. The campus speech zone policy required students to reserve one of the two zones available on campus to exercise their free speech, with the two zones making up only 0.0015 percent of the campus.\n\nUzuegbunam reserved and was granted one of the speech zones to distribute religious literature for three separate dates. On one of those days, Uzuegbunam was ordered to stop because the campus had received complaints about his efforts. A lieutenant for campus police told Uzuegbunam that his faith-sharing efforts amounted to \"disorderly conduct\" under a GGC policy, which applies to any expression that \"disturbs the peace and/or comfort of person[s].\" Bradford, who shared the same religious views as Uzuegbunam, self-censored after seeing how Uzuegbunam was treated.\n\nADF filed a lawsuit against the GGC officials, but the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia dismissed the case, which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. During the time when the case was in the district court, GGC amended its speech zone policy and eliminated its speech code but did not provide any relief for the students. The policies now allow students to engage in expressive activity in open outdoor areas on campus without obtaining a permit, unless the group is over 30 people.\n\nThe lower courts found that the lawsuit became moot when Uzuegbunam graduated from GGC and after the college had changed its speech zone policy and code. However, ADF attorneys argue in the petition filed on Jan. 31 that the case is still alive, citing opinions from other circuit courts. They argue that the 11th circuit is the only federal appellate court that does not hold officials accountable for violating constitutional rights when they change the policies later during the litigation.\n\n\"[T]he Eleventh Circuit's outlier view allows these institutions to violate constitutional rights with impunity\u2014avoiding judicial review through a well-timed policy shift,\" the petition states. \"This rule sends a clear message to students when school officials trample their freedoms: 'Don't bother retaining counsel; we know how to game the legal system.' And it signals that colleges can keep censoring students without consequence...\"\n\nADF Senior Counsel Tyson Langhofer, director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom, said in a statement that he hopes the top court would intervene to \"make sure that this denial of justice doesn't occur to anyone else.\"\n\n\"We need to ensure that the wrong done to our clients is righted\u2014something that both the district court and the 11th Circuit failed to do,\" Langhofer said.\n\nThe case came under the spotlight in 2017 after the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a Statement of Interest supporting the two students. At the time, the DOJ argued that the students had adequately provided enough evidence to allege a violation of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights and that GGC's speech policies were not \"content-neutral, established an impermissible heckler's veto, and were not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.\"\n\n\"A national recommitment to free speech on campus and to ensuring First Amendment rights is long overdue. Which is why, starting today, the Department of Justice will do its part in this struggle. We will enforce federal law, defend free speech, and protect students' free expression,\" former Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at the time.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Pursues \"Politically Binding\" Climate Change Agreement, By-passing Senate Ratification\n\nThe Obama administration is reportedly planning to bypass the U.S. Senate's approval for a treaty by forging an international climate change agreement at a United Nations meeting in Paris next year. This alternative agreement, described as \"politically binding,\" would serve as a substitute for a formal treaty due to the Senate's unlikely ratification of an international climate treaty.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the agreement would not have the full force of a treaty but would \"name and shame\" countries into reducing fossil fuel emissions. The proposal is a hybrid, combining the legally binding conditions from an existing 1992 treaty with \"new voluntary pledges.\" Negotiators claim the new agreement would not require a ratification vote.\n\nUnder the terms, co-signers would have to enact climate change policies but would be on the honor system for meeting specific emissions levels and sending funds to developing countries. The State Department has downplayed the reported developments, stating that no agreement has been written, and it is premature to determine whether it will require Senate approval.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have criticized the move, with Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) stating, \"Once again, the president is trying to go around Congress and ignore Americans who cannot afford more expensive, extreme energy regulations.\" House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) also expressed concern, stating, \"This is another example of a president who is willing to ignore the rule of law to get what he wants.\"\n\nSen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) reiterated that the Senate would not ratify a treaty and vowed to continue fighting the president's \"economy-crushing domestic greenhouse gas regulations.\" He added that additional U.S. restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions would harm the United States as other nations like Australia either scrap or water down their greenhouse gas policies.",
    " Title: Trump Suggests DACA Program is \"Probably Dead,\" Calls for Merit-Based Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has stated that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, is \"probably dead.\" In a series of tweets on Sunday, Trump placed the blame on Democrats, claiming they are not genuinely interested in the program but are instead seeking to divert funds from the military.\n\n\"DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don\u2019t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military,\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe DACA program, established during the Obama administration, has been under threat since Trump announced last year that he would rescind it, giving Congress six months to craft a legislative fix. However, lawmakers have yet to reach a deal with the White House, and the president has stated that a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border \"must be part of any DACA approval.\"\n\nOn Saturday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it would begin taking new requests for immigrants seeking protections under the DACA program following a preliminary injunction last week that blocked Trump's decision to end DACA.\n\nIn another tweet on Sunday, Trump expressed a desire for immigrants to come to the U.S. based on merit, stating, \"I, as President, want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on MERIT. No more Lotteries!\"\n\nThis statement comes after a heated controversy over a report that said Trump, during a White House meeting with lawmakers last week, referred to immigrants from African nations, El Salvador, and Haiti as coming from \"shithole countries.\" According to the report, the president said, \"Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\"",
    " Title: Massive Unity March in Paris Following Terrorist Attacks; World Leaders Join in Show of Solidarity\n\nArticle:\n\nHundreds of thousands of Parisians marched through the streets on Sunday in a display of unity, solidarity, and defiance following last week's terrorist attacks. The demonstration, which attracted an estimated one million participants, was also attended by \"more than 40 world leaders,\" according to the BBC.\n\nNotable attendees included British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas. President Obama did not attend, sending Attorney General Eric Holder to represent the United States. The march focused on themes of freedom and French national pride, with chants of \"liberte\" (freedom) and \"Charlie\" in reference to Charlie Hebdo magazine.\n\nScenes from the march depicted a human tide flowing through streets closed to traffic, with the slogan \"Je suis Charlie\" (I am Charlie) prevalent on homemade placards, armbands, and T-shirts. A family marched four abreast, holding up print-outs in plastic sleeves, and there were flags too: full-sized French tricolors carried by demonstrators, and the colors of the Republic on the square of the Republic.\n\nFrench law enforcement officers have been advised to erase their social media presence and to carry their weapons at all times due to the activation of terror sleeper cells over the past 24 hours in the country, according to a French police source who attended a briefing Saturday. Amedy Coulibaly, a suspect killed Friday during a deadly kosher market hostage siege, had reportedly made several phone calls about targeting police officers in France, according to the source.\n\nIn a separate incident, several stones and an incendiary device were thrown through the window of the archive of the regional tabloid daily, the Hamburger Morgenpost, early on Sunday morning. The paper had splashed three Charlie Hebdo cartoons on its front page after the Paris massacre, running the headline \u201cThis much freedom must be possible!\u201d No one was hurt in the attack in the northern port city, and two people were detained, with an investigation underway.\n\nCorresponding events were held throughout France and all over the world. However, the specter of violence remains, with British intelligence's chilling admonition on Friday and French authorities warning that new terror cells have been \"activated\" after the Charlie Hebdo massacre. A branch of Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the deadly raid, with both jihadist brothers believed to have received training in Yemen, and their associate who took hostages and shed blood at a Kosher supermarket reportedly recorded a martyrdom video pledging his allegiance to Al Qaeda and ISIS.\n\nIn 2011, Charlie Hebdo's offices were firebombed in Germany, a precursor to last week's horror. Amid rising antisemitic violence in France and across Europe, many Jews are heading for the exits. According to a survey last year from the European Jewish Congress and Tel Aviv University, France had more violent anti-Semitic incidents in 2013 than any other country in the world. Jews were the target of 40% of all racist crimes in France in 2013 \u2013 even though they comprise less than 1% of the population. Attacks on Jews have risen sevenfold since the 1990s.\n\nOn Friday, the author wrote a piece exploring the difficult questions of defining \"true Islam\" and \"extremism\" at Hot Air. The \"not all Muslims\" caveats are not feel-good window dressing; please read these two stories. The article concludes with images of solidarity among heads of state and other dignitaries.",
    " Title: Opinion on Second Amendment Evolves After Sandy Hook Tragedy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe author, in a personal account, discusses their change in perspective regarding the Second Amendment and gun safety reform following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. Initially, they believed that a few sensible gun laws could address the issue, but the tragic event led them to reconsider their stance.\n\nBefore the Sandy Hook shooting, the author believed that the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms, was not problematic and could be regulated with common sense. However, after the shooting, they came to believe that the Second Amendment no longer promotes the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness but poses a daily threat to these values.\n\nThe author argues that the need for a well-regulated militia, as stated in the Second Amendment, is no longer relevant, as the military provides adequate security for the nation. They question the necessity of widespread gun ownership, citing the increasing number of gun-related deaths in the United States each year and the need for bulletproof backpacks in schools.\n\nThe author criticizes the National Rifle Association (NRA) for their stance on gun rights, comparing them to the supporters of the Scopes monkey trial, who fought to preserve a worldview that is no longer widely accepted. They also question the motives behind the increase in gun sales, suggesting a possible connection to the decline of the white majority in the United States.\n\nThe author concludes by expressing their belief that the United States must address the fear and ignorance that fuel the gun culture to ascend as a nation and cure the virus of violence. They call for the nation to grow up and become adults, so children like Noah Pozner, one of the Sandy Hook victims, have a fighting chance to do the same.",
    " Title: Vatican Rejects Concept of Self-Chosen Gender, Issues Document on Gender Theory\n\nThe Vatican has released a document titled \"Male and Female He Created Them,\" which rejects the idea that individuals can choose their gender and emphasizes the sexual complementarity of men and women for procreation. The document, published during LGBTQ Pride Month, calls for a \"path of dialogue\" and listening on the issue of gender theory in education.\n\nThe document, intended to help Catholic teachers, parents, students, and clergy address the \"educational crisis\" in teaching sexuality, relies on previous papal pronouncements, Vatican documents, and philosophers and theologians. The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest known for his work on improving the Catholic Church's outreach to the LGBT community, noted that the real-life experiences of LGBT people seem absent from the document.\n\nLGBT Catholics have denounced the formal document, labeling it harmful and contributing to hatred, bigotry, and violence against gay and transgender people. Pope Francis, who has argued against self-chosen gender, is credited with first articulating the Vatican's position in a 2012 speech.\n\nThe document calls for a new alliance among families, schools, and society to offer a \"positive and prudent sexual education\" in Catholic schools, ensuring that children learn the \"full original truth of masculinity and femininity.\" It characterizes gender fluidity as a symptom of the \"confused concept of freedom\" and \"momentary desires\" that characterize post-modern culture. The document also rejects terms such as \"intersex\" and \"transgender\" and argues that the purpose of the biological complementarity of the male and female sex organs is to ensure procreation.",
    " Title: Baltimore Courts Immigrants to Revitalize City Population and Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nHundreds of individuals gathered at Baltimore's harbor in September, with nearly 50 of them set to be sworn in as U.S. citizens. The event, held amidst the wind gusting off the water's edge, saw a diverse group of individuals, including young and old, uniformed members of the U.S. military, parents and children, immigrants from El Salvador, China, Honduras, and various other countries in between.\n\nThe national conversation on immigration reform has been stalled for years, and while President Obama has identified it as a top priority for his second term, Baltimore is moving ahead with its own agenda. The city is actively courting immigrants in an effort to revitalize its shrinking population.\n\nBaltimore, once a major port city and destination for people moving to America, experienced a significant population decline since 1950, with the city's population falling to just half of what it was in the 1960s. Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake aims to bring in 10,000 new families over the next decade, focusing on immigrants, a group that has helped other large cities grow. She hopes new families will boost income and property tax revenue, helping to reignite the city's economy.\n\nOne of those new immigrants is Zakaria al-Saghir, who moved to Baltimore County with his wife and their three kids in September. He is currently participating in a small discussion group at Baltimore's International Rescue Committee, an organization that helps newcomers learn the ropes in the U.S. Al-Sagheer chose Baltimore over other states due to the positive word of mouth from relatives who spoke about the city's population, treatment of new immigrants, and lifestyle.\n\nBaltimore's administration is making efforts to ensure all immigrants feel safe and welcome. The city has prohibited police and city officials from asking residents about immigration status, and is offering Spanish-language nutrition and exercise classes, Spanish story time at the library, and cultural training for the police.\n\nCatalina Rodriguez, Baltimore's Hispanic Community Liaison, is responsible for ensuring many of these programs run smoothly. She is currently training about 20 officers to recognize foreign identification cards, with immigrants who cannot get a state-issued driver's license encouraged to carry ID cards from their home countries.\n\nThe city is spending money on training programs like this one, but Mayor Rawlings-Blake states that the costs are negligible compared to the revenue new families will generate in taxes. It is too early to calculate Baltimore's return on investment, but there is another Northeast city that also tried to fight population decline by recruiting immigrants: Philadelphia.\n\nPhiladelphia, like Baltimore, experienced a similar population crash and growth in the 1950s and 2010, respectively. The bulk of the newcomers in Philadelphia were Asian and Hispanic immigrants. Amanda Bergson-Shilcock, who has worked for nearly a decade at The Welcoming Center for New Pennsylvanians, states that the city's immigrant population growth was crucial to its population growth and economic revitalization.\n\nSteven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies, however, is skeptical that Baltimore, or any city, can grow its immigrant population simply by ignoring immigration status or offering services. He argues that immigrants go where there are jobs and that even if cities like Baltimore, which has had a stubbornly high unemployment rate, could attract immigrants, it would not mean much for the local economy.\n\nDavid Kallick, director of Immigration Research at the Fiscal Policy Institute, disagrees with Camarota on this point. Kallick states that attracting new immigrant residents does help a city, whether they make a million dollars a year or $30,000. He argues that having people move into a neighborhood and pay property taxes is beneficial, as having empty buildings is expensive to a city.\n\nIn the short-term, Baltimore's open-door policy is unlikely to fill city coffers, as there is a cost to providing new immigrants services like language classes and healthcare. For Baltimore to be successful, Kallick states, it will have to do more than roll out a nice welcome mat to newcomers; it will have to invest long-term.",
    " Title: U.S. Security Officer in Libya Requests Additional Personnel Ahead of Benghazi Attack, Receives No Response\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Regional Security Officer in Libya, Eric Nordstrom, requested additional security personnel for the U.S. consulate in Benghazi several months before the diplomatic post was attacked, but did not receive a response from superiors, according to documents obtained by CNN. The disclosure comes ahead of a congressional hearing on Wednesday regarding the September 11, 2012, armed assault that resulted in the death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nU.S. intelligence believes the incident was a terrorist act. Nordstrom had conveyed concerns about the Libyan government's ability to protect American diplomatic facilities and sent two cables to State Department headquarters last March and again in July requesting additional security agents for the Benghazi post.\n\nIn a summary of his interview with House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Democrats, Nordstrom stated that Deputy Assistant Secretary Charlene Lamb wanted to keep the number of U.S. security personnel in Benghazi \"artificially low.\" Nordstrom said Lamb generally believed that extra security was unnecessary because there was a residential safe haven to fall back on in an emergency.\n\nNordstrom also said that Lamb thought the \"best course of action was to assign three agents\" to the Benghazi post, while the facility usually had three or four agents. However, Nordstrom also told the committee that Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy issued a memo last December requiring five agents be assigned to Benghazi.\n\nSenior State Department officials have stated that security personnel in Benghazi were outmanned and outgunned during the attack, and that no reasonable security presence could have successfully fended it off. A senior agency official said, \"The lethality and the number of armed people is unprecedented. There had been no attacks like that anywhere in Libya - Tripoli, Benghazi, or anywhere - in the time that we had been there. And so it is unprecedented, in fact, it would be very, very hard to find precedent for an attack like in recent diplomatic history.\"\n\nThe Oversight Committee hearing has been criticized by Democrats as election-year political grandstanding rather than a serious effort to find answers about the attack. Nordstrom, Lamb, Kennedy, and Army Lt. Col Andrew Wood, commander of a security support team in Tripoli, are expected to testify at the hearing.\n\nNordstrom also described in an email a list of specific security incidents that occurred in Libya from June 2011 to June 2012. The email and the list of incidents provided to CNN by the Oversight Committee outline examples of common conflict zone incidents, such as carjackings and grenade attacks, to more serious cases that include assassinations and an attack on the motorcade of the British ambassador.\n\nThe document describes a general increase in crime in Tripoli, the large numbers of armed civilians, clashes between rival militias, widespread unemployment, random violence, and revenge killings. One incident refers to a June 6, 2012, bomb attack on the consulate in Benghazi and notes that an al-Qaeda-affiliated group had claimed credit.\n\nThe list concludes that \"the risk of U.S. mission personnel, private U.S. citizens, and businesspersons encountering an isolating event as a result of militia or political violence is 'HIGH.' The government of Libya does not yet have the ability to effectively respond to and manage the rising criminal and militia-related violence, which could result in an isolating event.\"\n\nDemocratic staff allege that Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa and his staff have failed to consult them, refused to make witnesses available to Democratic staff, and withheld documents. Democrats also assert that Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the Oversight panel's security, homeland, and foreign operations subcommittee, effectively excluded them from joining his delegation on a trip to Libya last weekend. However, Chaffetz denied that was the case.",
    " Title: Intelligence Agencies and Former Obama Officials Submit \"Unmasking\" Requests for Michael Flynn Information\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, along with the directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) submitted \"unmasking\" requests for information about Michael Flynn contained in highly classified intelligence reports, according to documents released on Wednesday.\n\nThe documents show that an unmasking request was made in Biden's name on January 12, 2017. Similar requests were made under the names of James Comey, John Brennan, and James Clapper, the former directors of the FBI, CIA, and ODNI, respectively. Denis McDonough, who served as chief of staff to President Obama, also submitted a request on January 5, 2017, according to the documents.\n\nUnmasking refers to the process whereby high-level U.S. government officials request information regarding American citizens mentioned in classified foreign intelligence reports. It is not illegal to make unmasking requests, but the Flynn case is unique because information about phone calls he had with Russia's ambassador was leaked to the media during the presidential transition period.\n\nThe documents do not specify whether Biden or others who submitted the unmasking requests saw the information related to Flynn. The document released on Wednesday stated that the unmasking requests were made under 16 different government officials' names for an unspecified number of intelligence reports.\n\nThe list of recipients who may have received Lt. Gen. Flynn's identity in response to a request processed between November 8, 2016, and January 31, 2017, to unmask an identity that had been generically referred to in an NSA foreign intelligence report, was also included in the documents. The list includes several high-profile Obama administration figures, including Brennan, Clapper, and Biden, but also includes lesser-known officials at the Treasury Department and State Department.\n\nRepublicans have focused on the unmasking issue to try to figure out who leaked information about communications that Flynn had in late December 2016 with Sergey Kislyak, who then served as Russian ambassador to the U.S. Kislyak contacted Flynn on December 28, 2016, the same day that the Obama administration ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the U.S. because of Russian hacking during the presidential campaign.\n\nThe records do not settle the question of who made the unmasking request for information from Kislyak's communications with Flynn. Comey suggested in testimony to the House Intelligence Committee on March 2, 2017, that someone in the FBI made the request that revealed that Flynn spoke with Kislyak. Clapper submitted an unmasking request on December 28, 2016, according to the declassified documents. However, Clapper suggested in testimony to the House Intelligence panel that the FBI submitted the request regarding the Kislyak phone calls.\n\nThe declassified records list Comey as the only FBI official to make an unmasking request for Flynn records. That request was submitted on December 15, 2016, two weeks before Flynn spoke with Kislyak. John Bass, who served as U.S. ambassador to Turkey, submitted a request for Flynn information on December 28, 2016. The next request was not submitted until McDonough, the White House chief of staff, did so on January 5, 2017.\n\nBoth McDonough and the Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment. The documents do not specify whether the unmasking requests were made for information other than Flynn's communications with Kislyak. The documents were released by Sens. Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson. Richard Grenell, the acting director of national intelligence, declassified the information last Thursday and provided it to the senators this week. Paul Nakasone, the director of the National Security Agency (NSA), provided the list to Grenell on May 1.",
    " Title: U.S. Military Conducts Airstrikes to Protect Haditha Dam in Iraq\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States military has launched airstrikes to protect the Haditha Dam in western Iraq, according to a statement by Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary. The airstrikes, which are part of the ongoing air campaign against the Islamic State, targeted Islamic State positions around the dam.\n\nThe Haditha Dam, a hydroelectric facility on the Euphrates River, is the second-largest hydroelectric contributor to Iraq's power system, according to National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. The military stated that the airstrikes were conducted to prevent the Islamic State from threatening the dam's security, which remains under control of Iraqi security forces with support from Sunni tribes.\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel, speaking in Georgia, rejected the suggestion that the strikes open a new front in the war against the Islamic State or represent an escalation of U.S. military operations. The announcement comes after President Obama stated that the United States was prepared to \"take the fight\" to the militant group, which poses a threat to the region and the West.\n\nThe new strikes mark the first shift toward targets in western Iraq, a region with a patchwork of conflicting loyalties. Some Sunnis have supported the Islamic State as a bulwark against the Shiite-dominated government, but tribes have taken different stands in the face of the militant offensive. Some tribes are fighting against the militants, while others are supporting the Islamic State or remaining neutral.\n\nTribes in the Haditha dam region have been fighting against the militants for months. The U.S. military stated that the dam remains in the hands of tribes working in support of the Iraqi government and Iraqi security forces.\n\nThe U.S. air campaign began on August 8 and has expanded as it has taken on more missions. U.S. planes have targeted areas around the Mosul Dam, allowing a combination of Iraqi counterterrorist forces and Kurdish peshmerga fighters to retake the facility from Islamic State militants. U.S. aircraft also targeted militants around Mount Sinjar, where a religious minority had taken refuge after militants had overrun their community, and more recently, U.S. aircraft helped break the siege of Amerli, a Shiite Turkmen town.\n\nSince the air campaign began, the U.S. military has conducted 138 airstrikes in Iraq.",
    " Title: Five Protesters Arrested, Businesses Damaged in Ferguson Following Destruction of Michael Brown Memorial\n\nArticle:\n\nFive protesters were arrested and some businesses were damaged Tuesday night in Ferguson, Missouri, after a memorial to Michael Brown was destroyed in a fire. The incident reignited tensions in the St. Louis suburb that experienced violence this summer following the shooting of Brown, an unarmed teenager, by a Ferguson police officer.\n\nDuring a news conference Wednesday, Capt. Ron Johnson with the Missouri State Highway Patrol reported two St. Louis County police officers were injured during the unrest. One officer was hit with a rock, sustaining an injury under his eye, but is expected to recover.\n\nThe unrest began Tuesday when a beauty supply store was looted and vandalized. Capt. Jeremy Corcoran with the Ferguson police stated this was the third time the store had been broken into in the last six weeks.\n\nFollowing the break-in, a fire was reported at a restaurant on Carson Road. An investigation revealed gasoline was poured around the restaurant, and the fire was put out by Ferguson firefighters.\n\nSome protesters stated they were in the streets because the makeshift memorial to Brown had been burned earlier in the day. Protesters believed the fire was set intentionally.\n\nThe fire started around 6:45 a.m. CT Tuesday on Canfield Drive, the street where Brown was killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.\n\nCapt. Johnson stated the fire started small enough to have been put out with a cup of water, but instead, some people stood watching the fire for 11 minutes until police and firefighters arrived. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, but Johnson does not believe a police officer started it. A full investigation is underway to determine the cause.\n\nLater Tuesday, residents rebuilt the memorial. The blaze angered many people who live near the scene, with one man describing it as a grave being desecrated.\n\nAround 12:15 a.m., unpeaceful protesters started shining lights into the eyes of police, shouting about shooting officers and burning down the town, according to Johnson. He stated the protesters were positioning themselves close to officers, so the decision was made to disperse the crowd. Johnson said when they attempted to break up the group, some started throwing bottles, rocks, and other items at police, injuring two officers.\n\nThe unrest continued, Johnson said, when someone near Canfield fired shots at the officers. He stated he saw the muzzle flash from the gun and sought shelter. Officers were wearing bulletproof vests, but Johnson said a lot of the heavy equipment used during the unrest in August was not used Tuesday, but they will start to respond to the area in riot gear if it becomes necessary.\n\nJohnson also reported a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a parking facility.\n\nOf the five people arrested for failing to disperse, Johnson believed one person also is facing assault and inciting a riot charges.\n\nBrown's death led to weeks of protest and unrest in the St. Louis suburb. After a month without an arrest, Brown's parents and activists questioned why Wilson had not been indicted in the killing.

    " Title: Mother Confronts EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in Washington D.C. Restaurant\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent incident, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt was approached by a mother and her 2-year-old son while dining out in Washington D.C., making him the latest Trump administration official to be confronted in public. The woman, identified as Kristin Mink, a 33-year-old sixth-grade teacher at Sidwell Friends, the school former President Obama\u2019s daughters attended, walked up to Pruitt while he was at a restaurant.\n\nMink addressed Pruitt, stating, \"This is my son, he loves animals, he loves clean air, he loves clean water.\" She then urged Pruitt to resign due to the numerous ethics complaints and federal inquiries he faces.\n\nPruitt is under investigation by the EPA's inspector general, the Government Accountability Office, and the White House, concerning allegations of Pruitt's spending on first-class travel and security, his dealings with subordinates and lobbyists, and other matters. The EPA's senior counsel resigned last month following an investigation into allegations of mismanagement and spending at the EPA. Pruitt has also been criticized for his rental of a Capitol Hill condo tied to a prominent oil and gas lobbyist, and the use of first-class travel and luxury hotel suites, among other things.\n\nMink had notes that she occasionally glanced at while talking to Pruitt. \"I had to decide what to say; he's so scandal-ridden,\" Mink told The New York Post. \"I jotted down just a couple of points that I wanted to make to him that were a little on the specific side.\"\n\nPruitt left after the encounter, but his spokesman, Lincoln Ferguson, stated that this was not the reason. \"Administrator Pruitt always welcomes input from Americans, whether they agree or disagree with the decisions being made at EPA,\" Ferguson said in a statement. \"This is evident by him listening to her comments and going on to thank her, which is not shown in the video. His leaving had nothing to do with the confrontation; he had simply finished his meal and needed to get back to EPA for a briefing.\"",
    " Title: Federal Judge Holds Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in Contempt for Violating Court Order on For-Profit College Loans\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was held in contempt of court after a federal judge said she violated an earlier order to stop collecting loans from former students of a defunct for-profit college chain. U.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim issued the ruling Thursday in San Francisco, stating that DeVos and the department made \"only minimal efforts\" to comply with a 2018 court order.\n\nThe dispute stems from a lawsuit filed by thousands of former Corinthian Colleges students who claim they were defrauded by the chain before it collapsed in 2015. The suit seeks full forgiveness of their federal student loans under a rule created by the Obama administration, and challenges DeVos' 2017 decision to provide only partial relief based on borrowers' incomes.\n\nIn a May 2018 decision, Kim ruled that the partial-relief formula was unlawful. She ordered the department to stop using the formula and to stop collecting student loans from former Corinthian students.\n\nHowever, in a September court filing, the department acknowledged that it incorrectly sent loan bills to more than 16,000 former Corinthian students, prompting more than 3,000 to send payments. The department also garnished wages or tax refunds from 1,800 borrowers and provided credit agencies with negative reports about 800 borrowers.\n\nThe judge wrote that there was \"no question\" the department and DeVos violated the May 2018 injunction. She said the defendants had \"not provided evidence that they were unable to comply with the preliminary injunction, and the evidence shows only minimal efforts to comply with the preliminary injunction.\"\n\nThe Education Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLawyers for the former Corinthian students called the ruling a \"rare and powerful action\" that provides consequences for the \"extreme harm\" DeVos caused.\n\nDeVos \"repeatedly and brazenly violated the law to collect for-profit college students' debts and deny their rights,\" said Toby Merrill, director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending, which helped file the suit. \"The judge is sending a loud and clear message: Students have rights under the law, and DeVos's illegal and reckless violation of their rights will not be tolerated.\"\n\nIn her ruling, the judge said the department sent just a single, three-sentence email with instructions to loan servicers, along with an \"equally cursory\" email to certain borrowers. There were no meetings or phone calls, Kim wrote, and little effort to make sure loan servicers received the emails.\n\nThe judge threatened to impose further sanctions if the department fails to follow her order, saying she would appoint a court official to help enforce the injunction. The $100,000 fine will repay students for expenses they incurred to raise the issue to the court. The fine is to be paid by the department, not by DeVos personally.",
    " Title: Delivery Services Surge Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: Ethical Dilemma and Worker Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has led to a significant increase in demand for delivery services as people opt to stay at home and practice social distancing. This surge in demand has caused restaurants to transition to takeout-only businesses, and food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash to scramble to meet the increased orders. Grocery orders were up 150 percent in March compared to the same period last year.\n\nThe delivery system relies on an army of delivery workers to bring food from stores or restaurants to people's front doors. These couriers, who face one of the highest risks of exposure to disease, are predominantly independent contractors who lack health coverage and other benefits. In March, workers for the grocery delivery service Instacart held a nationwide strike, demanding sick leave and protective gear like masks.\n\nThe ethical question of whether it is fair to ask someone else to take on the health risks associated with spending time in public while avoiding these risks oneself has arisen. Health experts argue that limiting the number of people shopping for food is beneficial in the nationwide effort to limit the spread of the virus. Additionally, delivery workers rely on the income they receive from deliveries, and choosing not to order could negatively impact both the workers and the struggling restaurants that prepare the food.\n\nHowever, delivery apps have been accused of exploiting the workers and restaurants they contract with by taking a large share of the income from deliveries. In some cities, delivery slots have become scarce, potentially denying those who are unable to shop for themselves the opportunity to acquire food.\n\nIndustry experts suggest that anyone ordering delivery should acknowledge the burden the courier is taking on for the public good by tipping well, giving good ratings, and taking steps to protect them from infection. Labor rights activists view the increased importance of delivery workers and other essential jobs as an opportunity to push for better conditions and benefits, potentially leading to more strikes and protests in the coming weeks and months.\n\nAdele Peters of Fast Company states, \"If a gig worker relies on orders to make a living, not ordering could affect their ability to pay their bills. But the sheer volume of deliveries now makes that unlikely.\" Luke Tsai of Eater comments, \"If you do order via one of the apps, at a minimum, please, please, please tip your driver beyond generously. People are out there risking their health so you get that carton of chow mein!\"\n\nFood labor expert Saru Jayaraman told The Atlantic, \"Our industry is definitely worried about people's safety, including their own, but they're also worried about survival and feeding their kids... It's not that they don't think this is a scary time to be doing delivery, but they also need their jobs.\"\n\nKhushbu Shah of Food & Wine suggests, \"Delivery apps should not be allowed to continue the same vulturous practices they deployed in a pre-coronavirus world. Until these apps actively start agreeing to commission caps, it's time to delete your delivery apps and let them burn.\"",
    " Title: Lawsuit Challenges University of Michigan's Speech Regulation Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nA legal challenge is being mounted against the University of Michigan, with its president, Mark Schlissel, and several administrative officials being sued for alleged constitutional violations related to speech suppression. The lawsuit, spearheaded by the organization Speech First, aims to invalidate Michigan's \"elaborate investigatory and disciplinary apparatus\" that allegedly exists to suppress and punish speech deemed \"demeaning,\" \"bothersome,\" or \"hurtful\" by students.\n\nSpeech First's complaint alleges that the university's speech regulation system, which includes \"restorative justice,\" \"individual education,\" and \"unconscious bias training,\" amounts to unconstitutional prior restraint of speech and is too overbroad and vague to provide due notice of what is proscribed. The organization argues that the most sensitive student on campus effectively dictates the terms under which others may speak.\n\nThe university's warning that \"bias comes in many forms\" and that the \"most important indication of bias is your own feelings\" is cited by Speech First as evidence of the Orwellian nature of the threat of punishment for offending speech. The vaguely defined terms such as \"verbal conduct that victimizes\" or jeopardizes a \"safe and inclusive\" social climate could potentially have a chilling effect on humor, parody, satire, or plain speech about almost any topic.\n\nWhen the Wall Street Journal's Jillian Kay Melchior requested records of one year of bias incident reports, the university reportedly thwarted this inquiry by imposing a fee of over $2,400 for the public records. This secretiveness suggests that the university may be embarrassed by the nature of these reports.\n\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) has given Michigan a red rating, identifying a university that has at least one policy that clearly and substantially restricts freedom of speech. FIRE argues that bias response teams create a surveillance state on campus where students and faculty must guard their every utterance for fear of being reported to and investigated by bureaucrats.\n\nThe American Enterprise Institute's Frederick M. Hess and Grant Addison, in their National Affairs article \"Restoring Free Inquiry on Campus,\" note that ideological homogeneity in academia is producing \"formal policies and practices\" whereby \"limits on speech and expression have become ingrained in campus culture.\" Hess and Addison propose that taxpayer funds should not be subsidizing research at higher-education institutions where the conditions of free inquiry are compromised.\n\nAccording to FIRE, almost 40% of all federal research funds went to 25 institutions that have formal policies that restrict constitutionally protected speech in 2015. The University of Michigan ranks third among all universities as a recipient of federal research funding, with $735 million in federal funding in 2015, which was 54% of the university's total R&D grants. Although President Schlissel may be ideologically blinkered, tone-deaf, and complacent about his own biases, his bias-response teams may not be worth $735 million to him.",
    " Title: Conservative Movement Shows Signs of Shift in Military Policy Perspective at CPAC\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Texas Representative Louie Gohmert criticized several decades of U.S. foreign policy, primarily blaming former President Jimmy Carter for the wars in Vietnam, the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Gohmert's hawkish comments received a tepid response from the crowd, with some attendees expressing disinterest and others commenting that the topic could be found on the History Channel.\n\nThe conservative movement may be undergoing a change in its approach to military power, as younger members seem to be gravitating toward the restrained view espoused by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Paul, who gained media attention with his 13-hour filibuster last week against the president's unchecked drone authority, received an enthusiastic response from the crowd during his speech at CPAC.\n\nSen. Paul, the son of the libertarian, anti-war icon former Rep. Ron Paul, called attention to the cultural divide within the GOP, stating, \"The GOP of old has grown stale and moss-covered. I do not think we need to name any names, do we? Our party is encumbered by an inconsistent approach to freedom.\"\n\nThe theme of the conference, as indicated by the title of the opening panel on which Gohmert spoke, was \"Too Many American Wars? Should We Fight Anywhere and Can We Afford It?\" The scene at CPAC a few hours after Gohmert's talk was much different, with a standing-room-only crowd gathered to watch Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nPaul, in his speech, said, \"The new GOP will need to embrace liberty in both the economic and the personal sphere. If we're going to have a Republican Party that can win, liberty needs to be the backbone of the GOP. We must have a message that is broad, our vision must be broad, and that vision must be based on freedom.\"\n\nSen. Paul's 13-hour filibuster drew criticism from influential Republicans like Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain, but it also won praise from civil libertarians on both sides of the aisle. The filibuster generated over a million tweets, with 450,000 using the hashtag #standwithrand.\n\nConservatives of all stripes will have the opportunity to be heard at CPAC, with both the hawkish old guard and the cost-conscious, conflict-averse new guard, including figures like Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, speaking in prime spots at the three-day gathering. For younger attendees, the Paul message seemed to have a certain appeal.\n\n\"I appreciate the old guard and the hard-line conservatives, but there are a lot of different policies, both Libertarian and conservative \u2013 and I don't want to be disrespectful, but I see his (Paul's) appeal in the 21st century too,\" Taylor University student and CPAC participant Kasey Leander told FoxNews.com.\n\nThe CPAC gathering comes as the GOP is struggling with identity issues and trying to carve out a future. By most accounts, Democrats pushed a more unified message harder, faster, and more effectively than Republicans in the last election cycle. With the sting of 2012 behind them and midterm elections around the corner, the GOP is racing to retool their image and their message.\n\nThe roster of speakers at this year's CPAC speaks to the struggle. While there are some marquee names, there have been some big snubs, with popular New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell not invited to the conservative conclave. American Conservative Union chairman Al Cardenas told reporters he didn't invite Christie because the conservative movement is \"not a home for everybody.\"\n\n\"I am a firm believer that if the Republican Party's going to have success, it's going to do so by being a conservative party and not a home for everybody,\" he said. \"And that's how you grow. I mean, look, you grow your tent by convincing others, and persuading others, that yours is the way, and you build your tent by reaching out to the new demographics of America not with a watered-down version of who we ought to be but with a true, real, solid version of who we are.\"",
    " Title: American Airlines' Raise for Employees Sparks Controversy Among Wall Street\n\nArticle:\n\nAmerican Airlines' decision to grant preemptive raises to flight attendants and pilots has sparked controversy, with Wall Street expressing concern over the potential impact on the airline's stock and the broader industry. The move, which aims to close a compensation gap with rival airlines Delta and United, has been criticized by financial analysts who argue that higher wages could increase costs and set a problematic precedent.\n\nIn a widely circulated note, Citi analyst Kevin Crissey wrote, \"This is frustrating. Labor is being paid first again, shareholders get leftovers.\" The outcry from major financial players led to a drop in American Airlines' shares and a broader impact on the airline industry.\n\nHowever, some argue that the Wall Street perspective on labor compensation is misguided. By paying its workforce more, American Airlines could help address a long-standing issue of lower wages compared to competitors, potentially improving employee morale and setting the stage for future negotiations.\n\nJP Morgan's Jamie Baker was more critical, suggesting that the move was not just contestable as a matter of business strategy, but illegitimate. The argument from American Airlines' management and unions is that the raises are a matter of fairness and long-term sustainability.\n\nThe raises could be seen as a demonstration of good faith to the workforce, keeping employees happy and setting the table for future negotiations. However, Baker takes a darker view, arguing that the raise increases costs and establishes a worrying precedent.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported last year that workers as a whole have been receiving a smaller and smaller share of national income in both the United States and other rich countries. The reason for this trend is a topic of debate among economists, with monopoly power, global trade, robots, and landlords being the leading contenders for villain.\n\nOne underrated factor, according to Noah Smith of Bloomberg View, is a management fad for treating workers poorly. The backlash American Airlines faced in the stock market and the outraged tone of the analyst letters is a clear sign of the constant pressure that modern companies are under to be as stingy as possible with their workforce.\n\nA company like Apple, which invests money in environmental or accessibility initiatives, would never dream of taking a similarly high-minded attitude toward labor issues, even though it could make Apple Store retail employees as well-paid as any manufacturing worker from the \"good old days\" if it wanted to.\n\nThe controversy surrounding American Airlines' decision to raise wages for its employees highlights a broader issue: the tension between the interests of shareholders and the well-being of workers. While obsessive cost-cutting may be a good strategy for a given business, it is a terrible strategy for a national economy.\n\nBroad-based income growth creates broad-based business opportunities. The vast majority of Americans earn a living supplying services to other Americans, so when wages don't rise, we struggle to find economic opportunities. As the rich get richer, they still find limits to what they can realistically consume, plowing money instead into financial assets. That creates low interest rates that the government could take advantage of to go deeply into debt and massively expand public sector employment.\n\nHowever, politicians are reluctant to embrace a growth strategy that is so heavily dependent on debt and centralized control. A far better approach would be something more like a generalization of the American Airlines model. Profitable companies could pay workers more and shareholders less, leading to more spending on the products made by other companies. Those companies would then see their revenue, profits, and wages rise, and people might find themselves buying more plane tickets. That's how functioning market economies used to work, and in the end, even executives and shareholders ended up just fine.\n\nWith the unemployment rate finally down to a reasonably low level after years of painfully slow improvement, there's a chance we just may get it. But for it to happen, economic elites will have to learn to live with a world where labor really does get paid first.",
    " Title: President Trump Outlines New Rules for White House Press Conferences Following Jim Acosta's Restoration\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has stated that he will remove CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta from press conferences if he \"misbehaves\" going forward, following a federal judge's temporary ruling to reinstate Acosta's press pass. In an interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace on Friday, Trump discussed the decision, marking the first time Wallace has interviewed Trump since he took office.\n\nDuring the interview, Wallace brought up the judge's ruling, which stated that the White House must reinstate Acosta's press credential. Trump responded, \"Yeah, it's fine. I mean, it's not a big deal. What they said, though, is that we have to create rules and regulations for conduct, etc., etc. We're doing that; we're going to write them up right now. It's not a big deal, and if he misbehaves, we'll throw him out or we'll stop the news conference.\"\n\nWhen asked about the rules the administration would implement moving forward, Trump stated, \"We're writing them now. We'll have rules of decorum; you can't keep asking questions. We had a lot of reporters in that room, many many reporters in that room, and they were unable to ask questions because this guy gets up and starts, you know, doing what he's supposed to be doing for him and for CNN, and you know, just shouting out questions and making statements.\"\n\nThe temporary order from U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly lasts for 14 days, and further hearings are expected to take place in the coming weeks to determine if yanking the credential violated CNN and Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights. If the court rules in favor of CNN and Acosta, a permanent injunction may be granted.\n\nTrump emphasized his support for the First Amendment, stating, \"I will say this, look, nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do, and if I think somebody is acting out of sorts, I will leave. I will say thank you very much, everybody, I appreciate you coming, and I'll leave.\"\n\nAcosta's \"hard pass,\" which provided expedited access to the White House grounds, was suspended last week after a contentious exchange with Trump during a press conference. CNN filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration on Tuesday, demanding the restoration of Acosta's press credential, but Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called the move \"more grandstanding from CNN.\"\n\nIn a statement following the judge's decision on Thursday, Sanders stated, \"Today, the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House. In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter's hard pass. We will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum at the White House.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Fox News announced that it would support CNN's effort to restore Acosta's White House credential and filed an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court. The entire interview will air Sunday on \"Fox News Sunday\" at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. ET.",
    " Title: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel Faces Challenges in Confronting Defense Cuts and Internal Pentagon Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who has maintained a low profile at the Pentagon since his appointment nine months ago, is facing what some sources close to him describe as his biggest challenge as he prepares to confront a new round of defense cuts. According to a report in Politico Magazine, Hagel, who some administration officials refer to as a \"paper tiger,\" has shown signs of fighting back against sequestration cuts by reinstating five of 11 furlough days for Pentagon civilian employees without White House approval.\n\nWith a new round of defense cuts on the horizon that could take $100 billion a year from the Pentagon, Hagel and his commanders will need to choose between retaining troops and their benefits programs or paring back on modern weapons systems. The fight may determine the military's future as the nation winds down its war presence in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nHagel shares President Obama's goal of a more efficient, if leaner, military, reports Politico, but he is pushing to separate Pentagon spending entirely from the rest of the nondefense budget, putting him at odds with the White House, which is trying to put pressure on Republicans to spare social programs at the same time they are moving to restore some defense cuts.\n\n\"If you just start to carve out certain popular items from the sequester, you don't solve the problem,\" a source close to Obama told Politico. \"Chuck is just doing his job. He wants to exempt the military from the sequester, and that's understandable. But we're looking to get rid of the sequester across the board.\"\n\nPolitico also notes that Hagel is facing a set of challenges within the Pentagon itself, including finding a replacement for top deputy secretary Ashton Carter, who is leaving the Pentagon at the end of the year. Hagel is reportedly still interviewing people for the job, but Politico reports that Robert Work, a former undersecretary of the Navy, is considered the top candidate.\n\n\"To some extent you are seeing the Clinton effect,\" an unnamed former defense official told Politico, explaining why filling important positions at the Pentagon may be difficult. \"Why take the risks of working in a second Obama administration when you can make $300,000 in the private sector and then go work for Hillary?\"\n\nDealing with the budget cuts will be Hagel's most pressing and constant challenge, and that may eventually lead to a more public conflict with the president, according to Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican who voted against Hagel during his confirmation.\n\n\"The first thing he's got to do is confront the political team in the White House, which is asserting too much influence over policy decisions,\" Sessions told Politico. \"I just think it's his duty to speak the truth to the president and stand up. You can't just always continue in office if you are asked to execute a policy that you truly believe is harmful. You have to make up your mind if you should stay or leave.\"",
    " Title: Congressional Debate and Vote on U.S. Military Intervention in Iraq and Syria Triggered by ISIS Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent U.S. airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq (ISIS) have triggered a congressional debate and potential vote, as President Barack Obama's actions could impact his pledge to cut the Pentagon budget and his administration's approach to military intervention. The White House has justified the airstrikes under the president's constitutional powers as commander in chief, with Iraq's central government and Kurdish regional officials requesting U.S. assistance in combating ISIS.\n\nPresident Obama has been sending notifications to Congress regarding the airstrikes under the War Powers Act, which restricts American troops from engaging in military action for more than 60 days without congressional authorization. However, recent presidents have disregarded this requirement. Some lawmakers from both parties are growing uncomfortable with the president's unilateral decision-making regarding military action in Iraq and potentially Syria.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader from Kentucky, has called on the president to clarify how any additional authority he might seek to strike ISIS would protect Americans. McConnell argues that training and equipping the militaries of partner nations to counter ISIS, as the president has done in Iraq and is proposing to do in Syria, is insufficient to protect the United States.\n\nIf the president presents a strategic plan to protect the United States and its allies from ISIS, McConnell stated in a Saturday statement, \"I believe he will have significant congressional support.\" McConnell emphasized the growing ISIS threat and called for the president to take a more active role in formulating a response.\n\nIn a Sunday interview, President Obama expressed his vision of the Free Syrian Army providing the ground presence needed to confront ISIS in Syria. He acknowledged the opposition's fractured state and the moderate militias' perceived lack of capability compared to ISIS.\n\nRegarding Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, Obama stated that through his actions, such as using chemical weapons on his own people and dropping barrel bombs that killed innocent children, Assad has forfeited legitimacy. However, the president's policy and the coalition being assembled focus specifically on ISIS, not on ousting Assad. (ISIL is the name used by administration officials for the militant group.)",

Taylor was killed on March 13 when drug investigators, who had a \"no-knock\" arrest warrant, mistakenly entered her apartment.\n\nIn a letter to Detective Hankison, posted on Twitter, Chief Schroeder stated his intention to terminate the officer for what he described as \"extreme\" violations of standard operating procedures when Hankison used deadly force upon entering the apartment.\n\n\"Your actions displayed an extreme indifference to the value of human life when you wantonly and blindly fired ten (10) rounds into the apartment of Breonna Taylor,\" Schroeder wrote. \"I find your conduct a shock to the conscience.\"\n\nThe River City Fraternal Order of Police, which represents LMPD officers, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDetective Hankison, who was hired by the department in 2003, had previously been disciplined in January 2019 for reckless conduct that injured an innocent person, according to Schroeder's letter. Hankison will have the opportunity, with counsel or a union representative, to provide \"additional information or mitigating factors\" before his termination is finalized.\n\nBenjamin Crump, an attorney for Taylor's family, called the police chief's letter \"damning,\" and on Twitter, he expressed a desire to see the other officers fired and criminally charged.\n\nTaylor's death, along with the May 25 death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd and other police killings of Black people, has become a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement and has sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality.\n\nHours after the March 13 raid, Louisville police Lieutenant Ted Eiden told reporters the officers had knocked on the door before forcing entry and were shot at by Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. One officer was struck in the leg, and all three returned fire, hitting Taylor at least eight times, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal. Walker was charged with attempted murder and assault, but last month state prosecutors dropped the charges, the Courier-Journal reported.",

The meeting was arranged under the premise that the lawyer had damaging information about Hillary Clinton. In light of this admission, it is worth revisiting the numerous instances where Trump Jr. and other campaign advisers denied any contacts with Russians.\n\nThe Washington Post has compiled a list of seven such denials, with three of them coming from Donald Trump Jr. himself. In one of his denials, made on Saturday, he stated that his meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer, was primarily about a program concerning the adoption of Russian children. However, in March, he claimed that during the campaign, he had met with Russians, but he was not representing the campaign in any capacity. In July 2016, shortly after his meeting with Veselnitskaya, when asked about the Clinton campaign's allegations that Russia was attempting to aid Trump, Junior responded that \"I can't think of bigger lies, but that exactly goes to show you what the DNC and what the Clinton camp will do. They will lie and do anything to win.\"\n\nPresident Trump himself also denied collusion, though he made the denial off-camera after making himself appear guilty by evading the question during a press conference. After being asked twice, \"Can you stand here today, once and for all, and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign?\", Trump reportedly gave a firm denial off-camera to two reporters later.\n\nVice President Mike Pence responded with \"of course not\" to two different versions of the collusion question. Kellyanne Conway, a senior advisor to the President, stated \"absolutely not.\" Sean Spicer, the former White House Press Secretary, referred reporters back to Donald Trump's off-camera denial.\n\nAll of these denials were made after Donald Jr. met with a Russian with Kremlin ties who claimed to have damaging information on Clinton.

The administration had previously stated it would not permit such a move.\n\nRepublicans argue that the U.S. should not further reward Iran, given its recent ballistic missile tests.\n\n\"As Iran continues to undermine the spirit of its nuclear agreement with illicit ballistic missile tests, the Obama administration is going out of its way to help Tehran reopen for business,\" said House Speaker Paul D.

The controversy stems from a \"frequently asked questions\" (FAQ) explainer released and then retracted as part of the Green New Deal resolution's rollout.\n\nDuring a discussion of the ambitious environmental resolution introduced last week, Cotton pointed to the FAQ, which contained several ideas not included in the actual resolution. The most widely derided lines included a call for \"high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary\"; expanding public transit \"with goals to replace every combustion-engine vehicle\"; \"economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work\"; and a goal to \"fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump referenced ideas from the FAQ in his criticism of the Green New Deal during a rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday. Ocasio-Cortez has tried to distance herself from the FAQ, claiming that \"doctored\" Green New Deal documents were \"floating around\" and that a \"draft version\" had been uploaded and then taken down.\n\nSaikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, said \"an early draft\" that \"was clearly unfinished and that doesn't represent the GND resolution got published to the website by mistake.\" Chakrabarti also stated that there was a \"doctored FAQ floating around.\"\n\nCotton called it \"a classic example of a gaffe being when you say what you really mean.\" He accused the Democrats who proposed the Green New Deal of immediately trying to retract the white paper that went along with their resolution and criticized the media for being complicit in the cover-up.\n\nOn Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced he plans to bring the resolution to the floor for a vote to give senators an opportunity to go on record regarding their stance on the Green New Deal. Most of the declared 2020 Democratic candidates have expressed support for the Green New Deal, including Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Klobuchar plans to vote for the resolution but also implied she might not vote for it as written if it came to the Senate floor as \"actual legislation.\"",
    " Title: CNN's John Avlon Accused of Misinformation in \"Reality Check\" Segment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a segment on CNN's New Day show on Wednesday, July 8, analyst John Avlon delivered a \"Reality Check\" that was criticized for spreading misinformation. The segment aimed to fact-check Fox News host Tucker Carlson, but it inadvertently perpetuated false claims made by Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth during her appearance on CNN's State of the Union.\n\nDuring the segment, Avlon criticized Carlson for his comments about Senator Duckworth, highlighting her family's military service and her own public service record. The crux of the issue stemmed from Duckworth's statement on the State of the Union that President Trump spent more time at Mt. Rushmore \"honoring dead Confederates\" than discussing the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAvlon played a clip of Duckworth's statement, but failed to fact-check her claim. In reality, President Trump's speech at Mt. Rushmore did not honor any Confederates, as he spoke about former Presidents and other historical figures, none of whom were Confederates.\n\nLater in the interview, not shown by Avlon, Duckworth went further by claiming that Trump \"spent all his time talking about dead traitors.\" Carlson later quoted this false claim on his Tuesday show, referencing Duckworth's rejection of an invitation to discuss the issue of statue removal.\n\nIn the \"Reality Check\" segment, Avlon allowed Duckworth's misinformation to stand, implying that it was Carlson and Fox News who could not be trusted to provide accurate information to their viewers. Avlon concluded by suggesting that some individuals resort to fearmongering when they lack facts, and that viewers should question the reliability of Fox News in the current political climate.\n\nThis episode was sponsored by Finishing Touch beauty products and Liberty Mutual insurance.",
    " Title: Secret Service Protection of President Obama Sparks Concern Among African Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, concerns about the safety of President Barack Obama arose, with some supporters expressing worry due to perceived threats. Obama reassured his supporters, stating, \"I've got the best protection in the world. So stop worrying.\"\n\nFollowing Obama's presidency, the Secret Service reported a spike in threats, but they denied claims that he received three to four times more threats than other presidents. According to Joseph Clancy, the director of the Secret Service, the number of threats has since leveled out and remained consistent with his predecessors.\n\nFor many African Americans, recent security lapses at the White House have resonated deeply. Talk show host Roland Martin commented on his radio program this week, \"One of the greatest fears of a first black president was harm being done to him.\" The incident involving a fence-jumper making it into the White House underscores this concern.\n\nCharles D. Ellison, writing for The Root, a black-oriented online news site, raised questions about the security lapses. He suggested that either the Secret Service missed the memo about Obama being the first black president or they are overwhelmed.\n\nMany African Americans feel a personal connection to Obama's security, with Joshua DuBois, a former White House aide to Obama, stating, \"There's a broad extended family around the country of moms and aunts and uncles who feel a real sense of kinship with this first family, and they want to make sure they're protected and whole.\"\n\nSome supporters of the president have long asserted that he has been treated with less respect by political opponents and the media, attributing this to his race. This has fueled suspicion that perhaps the Secret Service has not been as committed to him either.\n\nDonald W. Tucker, a retired black member of the Secret Service, stated that he had no reason to believe the agency had not protected Obama vigorously but that he heard the concern regularly.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling on Political Ads: Distinguishing Issue Ads from Express Advocacy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe distinction between political issue ads and express advocacy ads has become increasingly blurred, making it difficult for the general public to discern the difference. This issue was addressed in the 2010 Citizens United case, where the Supreme Court ruled that a film produced by the tax-exempt social welfare organization Citizens United, which was critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton, was considered express advocacy against her candidacy.\n\nIn the case, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the film, titled \"Hillary the Movie,\" was not express advocacy against Clinton's candidacy. Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his decision, stated, \"We reject that argument. The film is quite critical of Sen. Clinton.\"\n\nToday, another social welfare organization, Crossroads GPS, is one of the most prominent political advertisers this spring. Crossroads GPS, co-founded by Republican strategist Karl Rove, has run ads attacking President Obama on a wide range of issues. Crossroads GPS President Steven Law states that the group is not just focused on the election but aims to change policies in Washington.\n\nCrossroads GPS spends a significant amount of time figuring out how to explain issues in a way that is viscerally appealing to viewers and persuades them to take action. The donors who finance these ads remain anonymous, a significant advantage for Crossroads GPS and other social welfare organizations, or 501(c)(4) groups as they are known in the tax code.\n\nPolitical scientists argue that the line between issue ads and express advocacy has almost been erased. Deborah Jordan Brooks, a government professor at Dartmouth College who studies political attack ads, explains that ads with a personal zinger or those with a lot of personal zingers but still contain some issue content can be difficult to categorize.\n\nCampaign finance lawyer Robert Kelner is not surprised by the vagueness, stating that it is all about free speech. He notes that the price we pay for the benefits of the First Amendment is that we have to essentially give a pass to some ads that look like campaign ads.\n\nHowever, it still matters which side of the line a group is playing on. A federal judge recently ruled that for certain types of issue ads, 501(c)(4)s have to name the donors. Yet, some groups are switching to express advocacy ads to avoid disclosing their donors. This is risky, as social-welfare organizations cannot make politics their primary purpose. Without 501(c)(4) status, an organization would lose the ability to take anonymous contributions, which gives it political clout. The line between what constitutes political activity and what does not remains unclear, and it is unknown how many ads a 501(c)(4) could run before it would jeopardize its 501(c)(4) status.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Declines to Intervene in Partisan Redistricting Disputes\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has declined to intervene in disputes related to partisan gerrymandering, ruling that such conflicts are best resolved through the political process and not through federal courts. The two cases, decided on Thursday, presented a strong opportunity for the judiciary to influence the political landscape, as North Carolina Democrats and Maryland Republicans alleged that redistricting plans discriminated against them based on their political views and hindered their First Amendment associational freedoms.\n\nHowever, the high court has historically declined to validate the theory of partisan gerrymandering. Various justices have identified the fundamental flaw in every partisan gerrymandering claim: it always reduces to the \"group right\" of a political party or faction to control a proportional number of seats. This \"group right\" has never been recognized by the court because it is foreign to the U.S. Constitution. Defining each political association that deserves a proportion of seats and assigning each voter to one of those groups remains unclear.\n\nThe court was curious to learn whether these problems had been solved in the latest set of cases. The court considered whether the plaintiffs had addressed the doctrinal problems and whether better mathematical approaches could provide a justiciable cause of action.\n\nUltimately, the majority found that there was nothing new under the sun. The individual right the plaintiffs claimed - to be \"free\" of partisan gerrymandering - turned out to be the same thing as the long-discredited group right to proportional representation. As a result, federal courts will not adjudicate claims for partisan gerrymandering, keeping redistricting judgments with the political branches. This decision is a victory for the Constitution, according to the Supreme Court.\n\nEddie Greim and Lucinda Luetkemeyer, partners at Graves Garrett LLC, represented the National Republican Redistricting Trust in one of the redistricting cases.",
    " Title: Biden Criticizes House Speaker's Stance on Immigration Bill at Naturalization Ceremony\n\nArticle:\n\nVice President Joe Biden delivered a keynote speech at a naturalization ceremony in Atlanta on Thursday, where he strongly criticized House Speaker John Boehner's comments regarding an immigration bill that passed the Senate earlier this year. Boehner stated on Wednesday that the House had \"no intention\" of voting on the bill.\n\nBiden expressed his disappointment over Boehner's announcement, stating, \"I am extremely disappointed that Speaker of the House of Representatives announced yesterday that he will not allow the process to work, he will not allow the House to play by fair play, the American way, and let Congress actually vote their conscience to fix a broken system.\"\n\nAddressing a crowd of 104 naturalized citizens and their families at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Biden encouraged the new citizens to help the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. He said, \"Do not pull up the ladder behind you when you come on board... there are millions of people who are already acting as decent Americans that deserve a chance, that deserve a path, to earn their way... so reach back, help as you move on, and do not be afraid.\"\n\nWith immigration reform talks at a standstill and the fate of undocumented immigrants uncertain, it is unclear what President Obama could do if the bill dies. In 2012, the President stopped the deportation of undocumented minors under a deferred action program.\n\nThe House is in session for 14 days between now and the end of the year, and the third-ranking House Republican, GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy, stated there is not enough time for the bill to be considered.\n\nBiden thanked the new citizens for \"picking us,\" and got big laughs from the audience when telling a story about his Irish-Catholic mother and one of her quintessentially American beliefs.\n\nIn closing, Biden pledged to let undocumented immigrants \"out of the shadows,\" saying \"they all came for the promise of a better life, and they're incredibly capable of contributing, and many are already contributing.\"",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Faces Opposition in Push to Repeal Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, may have faced significant resistance from within his own party. McConnell had reportedly anticipated that pressure from a majority of Republicans, who have long promised to dismantle President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, would persuade senators from Medicaid expansion states to support the repeal.\n\nHowever, McConnell's endeavors have encountered numerous obstacles. These include opposition from doctors, hospitals, patient advocacy groups, and, notably, governors\u2014many of whom are Republicans\u2014from states where the health care law has led to tens of thousands of residents gaining insurance coverage.\n\nGovernor John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, stated at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday, \"There may be some philosophical, you know, kind of textbook disagreement. But when you sit in a room and you say to people, \u2018Should we strip coverage from somebody who\u2019s mentally ill?\u2019 I\u2019ve never heard anybody say yes.\"\n\nLast week, Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, a Republican, stood alongside Brian Sandoval, the state's popular Republican governor, and declared, \"The bill that\u2019s currently in front of the United States Senate is not the answer\u2014it\u2019s simply not the answer.\" Heller added, \"It\u2019s going to be very difficult to get me to a yes.\"\n\nSenator Heller's stance, expressed early in the process, seems to have resonated with several senators across the political spectrum who are feeling pressure from their governors and, in some cases, state insurance officials, to resist any bill that could potentially increase premiums, the number of uninsured, or anything else disliked by officials in their states.\n\nIn addition, there is the complicating factor of President Trump, who, in any other scenario, would have been an asset to McConnell, but has instead proven to be a hindrance. Republican senators have closely observed Trump as he at times berated, cajoled, and mildly wooed House Republicans to secure their support for their version of a health care bill, which also faced internal divisions.",
    " Title: Obama Proposes Protections for Clean Water, Air, Threatened Species, and Landscapes; Republican Opposition Mounts\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has announced or is proposing important protections for clean water, clean air, threatened species, and threatened landscapes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans in Congress are counterattacking with a legislative blitz, reminiscent of the legislative assault led by Newt Gingrich and his \"Contract With America\" Republicans in 1994.\n\nThe opposition's arguments revolve around \"executive overreach\" and \"job-killing regulations.\" However, beneath the political rhetoric lies a deeper, unspoken grievance that President Obama is attempting to implement the promises of environmental laws passed by Congress years ago but unlikely to pass with the current Congress.\n\nIn May, the administration approved a rule that significantly increased the number of streams and wetlands protected by the Clean Water Act. The rule aims to ensure cleaner drinking water and minimal impact on responsible development. Despite this, the House has already passed a stand-alone bill to weaken the rule, and Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming introduced a similar bill in the Senate in April, citing potential harm to private property rights.\n\nPresident Obama is expected to veto any such measures.\n\nIn the realm of climate change, President Obama has utilized his authority under the Clean Air Act to increase automobile efficiency, crack down on mercury emissions, and reduce harmful smog. His most significant initiative lies ahead: a final rule due later this summer to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. This rule requires individual states to develop emission-reduction plans tailored to their energy mix and is central to President Obama's pledge to reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions by 28% from 2005 levels by 2025, and to his credibility as a leader in the fight against global warming.\n\nSenator McConnell, in service to the coal industry, has been urging states not to cooperate, while sending unhelpful messages to the rest of the world that President Obama will not be able to deliver. The Republicans are weighing how to undermine the rule, but there is little doubt they will attempt to do so.",
    " Title: White House Explores Repurposing Federal Funds for Border Wall in Case of Emergency Declaration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is reportedly investigating potential federal funds that could be redirected for the construction of a border wall, should President Trump invoke emergency powers to do so. According to sources from Congress and the Pentagon, the Army Corps of Engineers has been asked to identify projects that could be canceled or delayed to free up funds for a border barrier.\n\nProjects under consideration include military construction and civil engineering works designed to prevent damage from future disasters. President Trump has previously threatened to declare a national emergency if he fails to reach a deal with Democratic lawmakers regarding border wall funding, but on Friday, he stated he was not going to do it \"so fast because this is something Congress should do.\"\n\nAn emergency declaration would activate special powers that allow the president to redirect federal funds without additional authorization from Congress. Some view an emergency declaration as a potential way out of the ongoing spending stalemate that has led to the partial shutdown of the federal government for the past three weeks.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) urged Trump to declare a national emergency and build the wall immediately in a statement on Friday following a meeting with the president. On Thursday, Graham tweeted in support of the emergency powers, stating, \"I hope it works.\"\n\nHowever, tapping emergency powers to bypass a political dispute would likely result in a legal challenge. Trump reiterated on Friday that he was not inclined to take that step immediately. With negotiations at an impasse over the president's demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding and 800,000 federal workers missing their paycheck on Friday, the White House is evidently considering this option.\n\nAccording to a Democratic congressional aide, funds that could be redirected include those appropriated in February 2018 for flood control and disaster prevention, as well as the Army Corps' current budget for energy and water projects. Raiding these funds for the border wall would likely face opposition from lawmakers who rely on Army Corps projects in their districts and those concerned about losing control of the purse strings.\n\nRep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) stated, \"It's a spectacularly bad idea, a complete waste of money.\" He added, \"The only emergency we have on the border right now is people seeking asylum. And people seeking asylum are not trying to sneak in. They're turning themselves in and asking for a hearing.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declined to comment on Friday about a potential emergency declaration and the administration's use of Army Corps funds for the wall. \"When the president acts, we will respond to whatever he does,\" she said.\n\nTrump continues to argue that a wall is necessary. On Friday, the president hosted a roundtable discussion with state, local, and community leaders to highlight what he describes as a humanitarian and national security crisis. A new NPR/Ipsos poll indicates that the president's Oval Office speech on the subject had little impact on public opinion. Only 38 percent of those surveyed believed there is a crisis on the border, and fewer still were convinced of the need for a border wall.\n\nIllegal border crossings were lower in 2018 than in 2014 and 2016, but there has been a recent increase.",
    " Title: FBI Decides Not to File Criminal Charges in IRS Targeting Scandal, Raising Questions About Investigation Integrity\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly decided not to file any criminal charges in connection with the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) admitted, systemic, multi-year targeting of conservative nonprofits for improper scrutiny. The decision was made without interviewing any of the American Center for Law and Justice's (ACLJ) 41 targeted clients, and other Tea Party attorneys report their clients were not interviewed either.\n\nThe FBI's decision to leak its conclusions without interviewing the potential victims of the potential crime has been criticized as inexcusable. The timeline of events suggests a quick reversal from public contrition and damage control by the Obama Administration to aggressive anti-conservative spin and, ultimately, an attempt to bury the scandal.\n\nOn May 10, 2013, the IRS's Lois Lerner admitted to systematic targeting, blamed lower-level employees, and apologized on behalf of the IRS. On May 14, with the media in full cry, Attorney General Holder announced a criminal investigation, and the next day President Obama condemned IRS misconduct. However, by July, only two months later, the IRS scandal transformed from a source of outrage to a \"phony scandal,\" with the President openly dismissing its significance in public statements.\n\nThe ACLJ lawsuit on behalf of 41 clients in 22 states is ongoing. Representatives Darrell Issa and Jim Jordan have called for an investigation into the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Inspector General to answer questions about the FBI's investigation, including why the FBI did not interview the victims before making its determinations, why the lead attorney's partisan giving created an appearance of a conflict of interest, and whether the investigation was cursory and conclusive with a predetermined outcome.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the criminal investigation, the Obama Administration faces civil litigation and accountability before a federal judge. Justice may be delayed, but it will not be denied.",
    " Title: Trump Admits Mistake on Iran Cash Payment, Clarifies Video Claim\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump admitted on Friday that he had made a mistake regarding the $400 million cash payment made to Iran by the Obama administration. The admission came after a week of intense scrutiny following Trump's initial claim that he had seen \"top secret\" footage of the payment.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump suggested that the money transfer was a hostage payment to a terrorism-sponsoring government. \"We paid $400 million for the hostages,\" Trump said, according to CNN. \"Such a bad precedent was set by Obama.\"\n\nHowever, the money was not Iran's cash in the first place. The $400 million was paid to the U.S. by the deposed Shah of Iran in 1979 to buy fighter jets. The U.S. froze those assets but paid the $400 million back to the current government as part of the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nTrump went further by insisting that he had seen a video of the plane carrying the cash to Iran. \"I'll never forget the scene this morning,\" Trump said Wednesday, describing the alleged footage in detail. However, it was later revealed that Trump had not seen a classified video but had merely seen widely-circulated news footage of the plane carrying the U.S. hostages in Geneva.\n\nTwo days after Trump first described the video he had seen, the Republican presidential nominee admitted that the video he'd seen was the widely-circulated news footage of the plane carrying the U.S. hostages in Geneva.\n\nIn a campaign as fact-averse as Trump's has been, the acknowledgement, however unapologetic, of basic reality seems like the dawning of a new era. Trump's latest \"pivot,\" which has never quite stuck, may be as simple as acting like a normal human being, capable of recognizing facts and being nice to fellow humans. We'll see how long it lasts.",
    " Title: House Republicans Indicate Little Appetite for Comprehensive Gun Control Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, there are strong indications that any comprehensive gun control legislation will not be voted on by the House of Representatives. Interviews with multiple House Republicans from the Midwest and Northeast reveal a lack of appetite for a sweeping gun bill.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner has not received internal pressure from center-right Republicans, and given his difficulties with conservative elements within his conference, there appears to be little political incentive for him to move on the gun issue. This may leave President Barack Obama with few options other than focusing on background checks and executive action.\n\nThe political realities of Congress have received little attention in the media coverage of Obama's campaign-style blitz for new gun control measures. Leaders in both chambers have stalled on the issue, using the Biden commission as a cover to avoid taking a definitive stance. Even if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid were to attempt to push a bill through, there is minimal support among rank-and-file House Republicans for gun control.\n\nRepresentatives Charlie Dent and Jim Gerlach, two moderate Pennsylvania Republicans from swing districts, have expressed interest in addressing mental health issues to prevent future shootings but do not believe additional gun restrictions are the solution. Dent, who represents the Allentown area, stated that semi-automatic weapons are \"commonly owned\" in his district and beyond, and that the AR-15, which is often discussed in the context of gun control, is one of the most popular hunting rifles in the country.\n\nGerlach, who represents suburban Philadelphia, does not support new curbs on firearms or ammunition. He stated that gun politics post-Newtown may not be a significant issue in his district, as most people recognize that responsible gun owners use their weapons responsibly. Gerlah expressed openness to tightening background checks but not gun restrictions.\n\nOther House members and senior GOP aides report that the fiscal cliff and the supplemental spending bill for Hurricane Sandy have dominated the conference's internal conversation for the past month. The gun issue is expected to be raised at their retreat later this week in Williamsburg, Virginia, and additional pressure is likely to come with Obama's inaugural and State of the Union speeches.",
    " Title: President Trump Defends Immigration Restrictions, Blames Protests and Senator Schumer's \"Fake Tears\"\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump launched a defense of his controversial refugee and immigration restrictions on Monday, attributing the chaos at U.S. airports to a Delta computer outage, protests, and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer's \"fake tears.\"\n\nOn Friday, Trump signed an executive order that imposed a 120-day suspension of the refugee program and a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. from citizens of seven terror-prone countries, including Iraq, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan. The order led to confusion at U.S. airports as customs agents grappled with interpreting the order, and sparked outrage from civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers, some of whom attended protests at the nation's airports where some travelers were detained.\n\nSenator Schumer, D-N.Y., who has vowed to fight the order \"with every fiber of my being,\" tweeted Saturday that \"there are tears running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight.\" On Sunday, Schumer struggled to hold back tears at a press conference as he called the order \"mean-spirited and un-American.\"\n\nTrump responded Monday morning, stating that only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. He blamed the chaos at airports on a Delta computer outage, protesters, and \"the tears of Senator Schumer.\"\n\nTrump was referring to a Delta systems outage Sunday night that led to a number of delays. However, the chaos began Saturday, and so most of the chaos was not related to the outage.\n\nAfter promising again to \"Make America Safe Again,\" Trump reminded his Twitter followers that \"there is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country\" and urged them to \"study the world!\"\n\nTrump later doubled down on his criticism of Schumer, telling reporters after a White House meeting with small business owners that he thought \"there's about a 5 percent chance [the tears were] real.\"\n\n\"I noticed Chuck Schumer yesterday with fake tears,\" Trump said. \"I\u2019m going to ask him who is his acting coach.\"\n\nTrump aide Stephen Miller also defended the move Monday morning, stating on Fox & Friends that the list of countries was from a list drawn up by the Obama administration, and that the move was a preventive measure to stop terror attacks like those seen in Europe.\n\n\"Our task in this new administration is to prevent what happened in parts of France and Belgium and Germany from happening in the United States,\" Miller said. \"Where you have large pockets of radicalization that extend through generations and that become a long-term security problem.\"\n\nResponding to criticism that the order had been dropped on agencies with little-to-no warning, both Miller and Trump said that a window would have allowed potential terrorists to come in before it closed.\n\nThe Trump administration was forced to make a number of clarifications on the status of permanent legal residents or \"green card\" holders, while a federal judge issued a stay on deportations late Saturday.",
    " Title: UK Government Faces Legal Challenge Over Approval of Gas-Fired Power Plant Amid Climate Change Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe UK government is facing a legal challenge over its approval of a large gas-fired power plant, with environmental lawyers ClientEarth filing a judicial review. The power plant, being developed by Drax in north Yorkshire, would become the biggest gas power station in Europe and could produce 75% of the UK's power sector emissions when fully operational, according to ClientEarth.\n\nThe planning inspectorate had recommended that the 3.6GW gas plant be refused permission due to its potential adverse effects on the government's commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions. This marked the first big project rejected due to the climate crisis. However, Andrea Leadsom, the secretary of state for business, energy, and industrial strategy, overruled the advice and gave the go-ahead in October.\n\nClientEarth has been granted permission by the high court to sue ministers, with the case expected to be heard in about two months. The environmental lawyers have previously inflicted three defeats on ministers over their failure to tackle air pollution.\n\nSam Hunter Jones, a lawyer at ClientEarth, stated, \"With scientists ringing the alarm bells for decades, we shouldn't need to take the government to court over its decision. [Leadsom's] decision is at odds with the government's own climate change plans. As the planning inspectorate found, if this plant goes ahead, the public risks a carbon budget blowout, or a huge stranded asset that would require propping up by the taxpayer, or a combination of the two.\"\n\nA Drax spokeswoman argued that the company's ambition was to remove, not add, carbon to the atmosphere by 2030. This would be achieved by burning wood or plants and then capturing and storing the emissions. The spokeswoman also stated that Drax's carbon-negative ambition could be achieved alongside \"new, high-efficiency gas power capacity as part of our portfolio\" and provide electricity when the wind was not blowing or the sun shining.\n\nThe UK government's actions to tackle the climate emergency are under particular scrutiny this year as it will host a vital UN summit in Glasgow in November. The world's nations must dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions at the summit to avoid a disastrous 3-4C rise in global temperatures.\n\nIn its planning application, Drax stated that its proposal for four new gas turbines was warranted to replace its existing two coal-fired units ahead of the government's proposed phase-out of coal in 2025. It also claimed that the new gas plant would be \"capable\" of having carbon capture technology fitted in the future.\n\nIn overruling the planning inspectorate, Leadsom argued that the plant's high carbon emissions were not a reason to block approval under the existing rules. However, ClientEarth argues that the combination of the project's large scale, level of carbon emissions, and long operating life make it a significant threat to the UK's carbon targets.\n\nThe planning inspectorate also concluded that wind and solar power would cut payers' bills, while the proposed gas plant would not. \"Both [Drax] and [National Grid] confirmed that it is the production of renewable plants that will deliver cheaper energy,\" the planning inspectorate stated.",
    " Title: Victoria Toensing's Allegations of Benghazi Cover-up: A Review of Past Claims and Current Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican attorney Victoria Toensing has resurfaced in the news, this time claiming that anonymous State Department and CIA whistleblowers have been prevented from testifying about the September 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya. Fox News' Ed Henry brought up the story during a press conference with President Obama, who stated he had no knowledge of the matter.\n\nIt is worth noting that this is not the first time Toensing has made allegations of a cover-up regarding the Benghazi attack. In November 2012, she wrote an op-ed for Fox News, attempting to draw a connection between the Benghazi attack and the abrupt resignation of former CIA Director David Petraeus.\n\nToensing's argument was complex and convoluted. She suggested that Petraeus' support for the White House's initial indications that an anti-Islam video had incited the Benghazi attackers was \"strange,\" given that Petraeus, in her view, must have known otherwise. Toensing posited that the administration's initial response was a deliberate attempt to downplay the role of radical Islamic groups in the attack, which she believed was a cover-up.\n\nToensing's theory involved several interconnected elements. She suggested that Obama was blackmailing Petraeus with knowledge of an extramarital affair that led to Petraeus' resignation. Furthermore, she claimed that the administration had concealed the affair to use it against Petraus at a later date.\n\nToensing's theory was met with skepticism, as it relied on several tenuous connections and speculative assumptions. For instance, she suggested that Petraeus' memory of the affair would have been fresh during a 2011 polygraph test, despite the fact that polygraph tests do not typically delve into personal details of a candidate's life.\n\nToensing's column was published just before Petraeus was scheduled to testify before Congress on the Benghazi attack. However, her predictions proved incorrect, as Petraeus testified as planned a few days later and explained the administration's initial response to the attack.\n\nIn conclusion, Victoria Toensing's past allegations of a Benghazi cover-up have been largely discredited. Her latest claims regarding whistleblowers and alleged obstruction should be approached with caution, as they rely on speculative connections and a lack of verifiable evidence.

The proposal comes after a white gunman's attack on a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, on August 3, which resulted in the deaths of 22 people.\n\nO'Rourke, a former congressman, announced his plan a day after he recalibrated his presidential campaign, emphasizing the plight of immigrants and addressing what he characterized as racially charged and divisive rhetoric from Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a statement, O'Rourke stated, \"The terrorist attack on El Paso, fueled by the racist rhetoric of Donald Trump, was not only an attack on America, but an attack on the aspirational ideals of this nation.\" He further added, \"It's time for bold solutions... without fear of political ramifications so we can finally start making progress and saving lives.\"\n\nSenator Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential candidate and O'Rourke's rival, had previously announced his intention to create a White House office to combat white supremacy and hate crimes if elected.\n\nUnder O'Rourke's plan, if elected president, he would ensure that the FBI and the Department of Justice prioritize neo-Nazi and white supremacist violence, and he would create dedicated domestic terrorism offices within the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.\n\nO'Rourke also plans to hold internet companies and social media platforms accountable for hosting hate speech and the amplification of domestic terrorism, take on the National Rifle Association gun lobby group, and implement a mandatory national buyback program for assault weapons and a voluntary buyback program for handguns.\n\nO'Rourke is one of many Democratic candidates vying to become the nominee to take on Trump in next November's election who have criticized what they perceive as the president's divisive and incendiary rhetoric about undocumented migrants.",
    " Title: Senate Health Care Bill Negotiations: GOP Senators Disagree on Current Proposal, Consider Bipartisan Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that if Republican senators cannot agree on the current health bill, they will have to devise an alternative approach. Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) said on CBS's Face the Nation that the Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is \"probably going to be dead.\"\n\nSupport for the bill has been waning during the July 4th recess, and McCain suggested that Republicans should collaborate with Democrats to draft health care legislation. This possibility was floated last week by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said, \"No action is not an alternative.\"\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) reiterated his push to simply repeal Obamacare, let it take effect for a year or two, and use that time to debate replacement. \"I continue to believe we can get this done,\" he said on Face the Nation.\n\nRepublicans need at least 51 votes to pass their repeal and replace proposal, and they have not been able to secure the necessary support. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said on NBC's Meet the Press that he would support the current proposal, but expressed uncertainty about whether Republicans can come together. \"Mitch is trying,\" Graham said. \"I would support the proposal before us, but you've got different camps in the Republican Party.\"\n\nGraham noted that with insurers withdrawing from exchanges and premiums rising, the failure of Obamacare is imminent. \"My advice is if it does fail, work together in a bipartisan fashion to replace it,\" he said.\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter later on Sunday to encourage senators to move forward. \"For years, even as a 'civilian,' I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare,\" he wrote. \"Now they finally have their chance!\"\n\nThe Senate health care bill negotiations are ongoing, with key issues such as Medicaid expansion, essential health benefits, and subsidies for low-income individuals still under discussion. The future of the current health bill remains uncertain, and the possibility of a bipartisan approach to health care reform is being considered.",
    " Title: White House Installs Senior Aides at Federal Agencies to Maintain Control Over Policy Implementation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is installing senior aides atop major federal agencies, creating a direct line with loyalists who can monitor and shape the administration's goals across the federal bureaucracy. These aides, given the title of senior adviser in each agency, have already been responsible for hiring at some departments and crafting the blueprint of Trump policy before the Cabinet members win Senate confirmation to take office.\n\nThe arrangement, described by four people involved in the transition planning, appears designed to help the White House maintain control over its priorities despite pledging to give Cabinet secretaries unusual autonomy. Having senior advisers reporting to both the agency chiefs and the White House could spur early tensions and create conflicts with that pledge of autonomy.\n\n\"They want to keep kind of a West Wing-infused attachment to the agencies,\" said a person familiar with the arrangement. \"There will be tentacles from the White House to these agencies...The effort is to demonstrate that all points lead back to certain people,\" such as Donald Trump's son-in-law, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, or chief of staff Reince Priebus.\n\nAnother person involved in the transition said Trump's team wanted a \"real strong line at the agencies to have someone monitoring and directing what they're doing.\" This approach bears out in the administration's picks for these posts, people who are far more political players than policy experts.\n\nFor instance, Wells Griffith will serve as the White House's new senior adviser for the Department of Energy, following stints as the battleground states director for Trump's campaign and as the former deputy chief of staff to Priebus at the Republican National Committee. Other campaign staffers have been given similar roles at several agencies, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nHistorically, the liaison positions are held by more junior staffers. Administrations typically left the bigger tasks, such as the policy agenda or management of the agency, to the Cabinet secretary, deputy secretary, and chief of staff.\n\nPrior administrations have used liaisons to help coordinate low-level policy, staffing, and operations between the White House and Cabinet agencies. President Barack Obama had them across the government for policy areas such as climate change and health care. They often gave the White House a lens into the agency and some understanding of the day-to-day operations, along with keeping tabs on their problems.\n\nWhat's different about the Trump hierarchy is the power these advisers are likely to have, according to people familiar with it. Obama's liaisons were often less powerful, while Trump's will connect directly to senior White House officials such as Kushner and Rick Dearborn, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy.\n\nIn Trump's Cabinet, a number of the secretaries have expressed disagreement with Trump during lengthy confirmation hearings on issues ranging from Russia to climate change to the use of NATO. Some of the picks were neutral in the election or criticized Trump's policies.\n\nTwo people involved in the transition said the new advisers are expected to maintain constant contact with the White House and the agencies and sign off on major decisions. The liaisons will also give the White House a window into agencies where Trump is not as personally close to the Cabinet secretaries. Some of the senior White House advisers in the agencies have frequently met with their respective secretaries, who did not pick them for the post.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said he modeled his own government that way, with a handpicked senior aide installed in every agency. \"I told my commissioners when I was mayor, you're going to have a spy in your agency,\" Giuliani said. \"I'm going to want to get two different perspectives of what's going on.\"\n\nThe jobs have rattled Obama administration political appointees, who have been surprised at young campaign hands having such authority at federal agencies. The advisers at each agency will not face Senate approval, like more than 1,200 other federal government positions, including deputy secretaries and administrators.\n\nTrump himself is likely to have little involvement in the minutiae of the agencies; people close to him expect him to want top-level briefings and little else. He tends to like conflict among his top aides and advisers, with them competing for his attention and respect.\n\n\"The government is too big to run everything out of the White House,\" added Stier. \"That pipeline is too small to deal with the breadth and complexity of the federal government.\"\n\nTevi Troy, a former White House aide and deputy secretary at Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush, said there are potential upsides for these advisers. For instance, they are not likely to face subpoenas in the event of mishaps at the agencies.\n\nYet, they also could face tensions with the Cabinet secretaries for micromanaging or feel torn about where to spend the majority of their time, in the West Wing or at the agency itself.",
    " Title: Maryland Gubernatorial Candidate Doug Gansler Criticizes ACA Implementation in State\n\nArticle:\n\nMaryland gubernatorial candidate Doug Gansler, a Democrat and current attorney general, has expressed displeasure over the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in his state. He is particularly critical of the state's online enrollment platform and the decision to hire a company from North Dakota for the implementation of the state's exchange.\n\nThe ACA, also known as Obamacare, has been a subject of partisan battles in Washington, D.C., and within the Republican Party. However, it is Maryland, the state just north of the capital, that has provided the country's first instance of a Democrat-on-Democrat dispute over the inept implementation of the law.\n\nIn the race to succeed outgoing Democratic Governor Martin O'Malley, Gansler is running against state Delegate Heather Mizeur and Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination who chairs the state panel on ACA implementation and has been presented as the O'Malley administration's point man on Obamacare.\n\nAfter promising to make deep-blue Maryland an ACA success story, Brown and O'Malley watched as the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange struggled, allowing fewer than 4,000 Marylanders to enroll in insurance plans by the end of November. The executive director of the state exchange resigned at the start of December.\n\nGansler has criticized Brown over the performance of the state exchange, arguing that it has \"failed miserably\" and provided \"fodder for Republicans\" who want to scrap the ACA altogether. He has used the health care mess as an example of Brown's perceived lack of substance.\n\n\"Brown and others were so boastful about Maryland leading the country, [but] here we are behind such states as Nevada and Kentucky, let alone California and states like that,\" Gansler said, emphasizing his support for the president and the ACA, but also expressing concern over the enrollment process in individual states.\n\nThe Maryland race is unique in that it features an open-seat contest for the heart of the Democratic base between two major candidates, one of whom was directly tasked with implementing a state health care exchange. For health care reform critics, Gansler is an imperfect messenger, a combative politician who replaced his campaign manager last week in an effort to steady his bid for governor.\n\nEven still, the success or failure of Gansler's biting message could reveal the level of frustration or patience among rank-and-file Democrats with the progress of a law that was supposed to usher in a new era of activist government. There is little chance of a competitive general election in Democratic Maryland, but success by Gansler could also presumably cheer Republicans who have put the ACA's implementation woes front and center for their 2014 message.\n\nGansler's campaign has faced several setbacks this year, including a recording that surfaced in The Washington Post, capturing Gansler dismissing Brown, who is black, for relying on his race as a campaign asset. Gansler's campaign called the recording a dirty trick. There was also a Post story on accusations that Gansler ordered his state trooper detail to violate traffic laws, a charge Gansler also attributed to political skulduggery. Most embarrassing was an ABC News report featuring photos of Gansler at a raucous high school beach party featuring apparent underage drinking.\n\nBrown, meanwhile, has garnered support from a host of unions and prominent elected officials, including O'Malley, Senators Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, and U.S. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer.\n\nEven with all that weighing on his campaign, bashing Obamacare\u2014even just on the details of implementation\u2014is a striking turn of events for Gansler, an Obama stalwart who fought in court to uphold the constitutionality of the president's signature achievement.\n\nAsked whether his ACA attacks were merely an attempt to turn the page for his campaign, Gansler said he had \"a rough rollout because of political dirty tricks on the part of the Brown campaign,\" but called health care the real issue in the race. Brown, a former state legislator and Iraq War veteran, declined an interview request and has generally shied away from engaging attacks from Gansler and others.\n\nJustin Schall, Brown's campaign manager, dismissed Gansler's ACA criticism as opportunistic and faulted Gansler for taking potshots on the ACA now, despite having done little to help with implementation as part of the advisory committee that Brown chairs.\n\n\"As attorney general, Doug Gansler is a member of the Health Care Reform Council, and he hasn't bothered to show up to a meeting in the last two years, so it's a little disingenuous when Doug opines on the importance of Obamacare,\" Schall said. \"When input on health care reform was needed, Gansler was nowhere to be found, and now Doug hopes people will forget his absence as he attacks a fellow Democrat on ACA.\"",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee to Examine Legality of President Obama's Executive Action on Immigration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is set to hold a hearing on Tuesday regarding the legality of President Obama's recent executive action on immigration. The hearing, which will take place on Capitol Hill, will question witnesses about the constitutionality of the president's move.\n\nChairman of the Committee, Bob Goodlatte, previewed the hearing on Fox News' The Kelly File, stating that Obama's executive amnesty is \"one of the largest unconstitutional power grabs by any president ever.\"\n\nThe witness list for the hearing includes Ronald Rotunda, a professor at Dale E. Fowler School of Law, Jay Sekulow, the chief counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice, Thomas H. Dupree Jr., a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, and Marielena Hincapi, the executive director at the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nIn his prepared testimony, Sekulow argues that President Obama's recent action on immigration violates the Constitution. He contends that the actions contradict Congress's express and implied intent, violating the test articulated in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. Sekulow also claims that by enacting a sweeping new program under the guise of \"prosecutorial discretion,\" President Obama has violated controlling precedent and defied clear instructions from his own attorneys at the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\nLast week, the Congressional Research Service determined that Congress does have the power to defund President Obama's executive amnesty action, despite the agency being primarily funded by fees. The Supreme Court has recognized that Congress may restrict agency discretion to allocate resources by putting restrictions in the operative statutes. If a statute were enacted which prohibited appropriated funds from being used for some specified purposes, then the relevant funds would be unavailable to be obligated or expended for those purposes.\n\nThe hearing is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET and can be watched live here.",
    " Title: Congress Approves Budget and Hurricane Relief Deal, Raises Debt Ceiling\n\nArticle:\n\nCongress, in a bipartisan vote, has approved a budget and hurricane relief deal brokered between President Donald Trump and top Democrats. The House of Representatives approved the bill by a vote of 316 to 90, with all 90 votes against coming from Republicans. The Senate approved the deal on Thursday by 80-17.\n\nThe deal, which was the result of an Oval Office meeting on Wednesday between Trump, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Vice President Mike Pence, and congressional leaders from both parties, raises the debt ceiling, funds the federal government through December 8, and provides $15 billion for relief from Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana last month.\n\nThe deal came as Hurricane Irma approached Florida. The deal's genesis was an Oval Office meeting on Wednesday between Trump, Mnuchin, Pence, and congressional leaders from both parties. Trump agreed to a Democratic proposal to tie hurricane relief to funding the federal government and increasing the debt ceiling for a three-month period.\n\nRepublican leaders had pushed for a longer-term deal, to raise the debt ceiling through the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats welcomed the deal, which they saw as Republicans being forced to grudgingly accept. Many congressional Republicans have long been opposed to raising the debt ceiling without taking steps to reduce federal spending.\n\nMnuchin and Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney received a frosty welcome when they pitched the deal to congressional Republicans in a conference meeting on Friday morning. Mnuchin, a former Democrat, and Mulvaney, a stalwart of the House Freedom Caucus before joining the Trump administration, made less than ideal surrogates.\n\nAt the meeting, Mnuchin provoked hissing and groans when he closed with a plea for members to \"vote for the debt ceiling for me.\" The meeting also got \"a little warm for Mulvaney at times\" according to Mark Walker, a North Carolina representative who noted that people in the room \"reminded him [of] some of the statements he had made in the past about relief packages tied to the debt ceiling.\"\n\nAfter leaving the meeting, Mulvaney dodged a question about whether he would have voted for the bill, choosing to praise Trump's decision to reach across the aisle. \"I thought it was absolutely the right thing to do,\" the former South Carolina congressman said. \"The president is a very results-driven person, he wants to see results.\"\n\nPeter King, a moderate from New York, saw the vote as a precursor to better days to come. \"We continue to work across the aisle, we'll get things done, we can't let one faction control everything,\" he said in a veiled shot at the Freedom Caucus. \"We represent the country, not a party.\"\n\nWith these must-pass measures out of the way, Trump is expected to spend the coming months focusing on promoting his plans for major tax cuts. No bill has yet been introduced in Congress, but Trump has made several speeches touting his proposals to lower corporate taxes to as little as 15%.\n\nOn Friday morning, after tweets about hurricane Irma and his frustration with Senate rules and the failure of healthcare reform, the president wrote: \"Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!\"",
    " Title: Democrats Call for Investigations and Potential Impeachment of Attorney General Bill Barr\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the acquittal of President Donald Trump by the Senate, Democrats have set their sights on Attorney General Bill Barr as a new target for investigations and potential impeachment. The focus on Barr stems from his apparent move to overrule prosecutors' recommended sentence for former Trump adviser Roger Stone.\n\nCriticism of Barr comes from various sectors, including members of Congress, members of the media, political operatives, and law professors. The Attorney General is under intense scrutiny for alleged \"misuse of the criminal justice system,\" not only in the Stone case but also in relation to the removal of U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu in January and accepting Ukraine-related information from Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\n\nBarr is also facing pressure from President Trump himself, as Trump pushed back against Barr's comments Thursday that he had never asked the Attorney General to intervene in a criminal case. Trump tweeted, \"This doesn\u2019t mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!\"\n\nOn March 31, Barr will answer questions on these issues in a hearing before the Democrat-controlled House Judiciary Committee. House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., wrote a letter confirming Barr's testimony, stating that the Attorney General's actions in legal matters relating to the President raise significant questions for the Committee.\n\nEarlier this week, four Department of Justice prosecutors resigned after top DOJ officials stepped in to soften their 7- to 9-year recommended sentence of Stone following a tweet by Trump about the case. Democrats called the move \"without precedent\" and sharpened their already simmering criticisms of Barr.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Barr \"ought to be ashamed and embarrassed and resign as a result of this action directly interfering in the independent prosecution of Roger Stone.\" He also stated that the controversy was yet another example of \"political interference by the president to alter the independent decisions of the Department of Justice.\"\n\nNadler did not answer a question on whether Barr should resign, but said, \"I think the behavior is extremely egregious.\"\n\nBarr, on ABC News Thursday, pushed back on Trump's tweet while also defending his handling of the Stone case. \"I'm gonna do what I think is right,\" he said, \"and you know, I can not do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.\"\n\nWhite House officials told Fox News that they knew Barr was doing the ABC interview but that they did not know what the AG would say.\n\nJon Cooper, chairman of the anti-Trump organization Democratic Coalition, tweeted, \"What Bill Barr REALLY means is that Trump\u2019s tweets saying the quiet part out loud are making it harder for him to do the crimes and cover-up.\"\n\nSome on the left have even called for Barr's impeachment, including MSNBC legal analyst Glenn Kirschner, who tweeted before the Stone developments last week that Barr has lied \"to Congress, he lied about the Mueller report, he refuses to investigate obvious crimes by the administration, he is conflicted out of many matters but refuses to recuse.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., told CNN Wednesday that he would not rule out launching a new impeachment inquiry into Trump himself over the drama around Stone and Barr. \"You know, we\u2019re not going to take our options off the table,\" he said. \"We want to work with him on prescription drugs, background checks, and infrastructure, but we\u2019re not going to let him just torch this democracy because he thinks that he\u2019s been let off once and we\u2019re not going to do something about it.\"\n\nOther politicians, such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Cory Booker, among others, have also called for investigations into Barr's actions. House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., condemned Barr on Thursday and called for an investigation but did not outright call for impeachment.\n\nAt the same time, Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Chris Coons, D-Del., and Booker, among others, have hit Barr in a joint statement on \"the politicization and maladministration of American immigration courts under President Donald Trump.\" The statement announced a letter they sent to Barr asking for documents on the matter.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have largely stuck by Barr. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., released a statement backing the AG on Thursday. \"President Trump, in selecting Bill Barr to be Attorney General, has done a great service to the people serving in the Department of Justice and our nation as a whole,\" Graham said. \"He is the right man at the right time to reform the Department and stand up for the Rule of Law. Attorney General Barr has my complete confidence.\"",
    " Title: Fox News Hosts Engage in Public Dispute over Donald Trump Interviews\n\nArticle:\n\nA public disagreement between two prominent Fox News hosts, Megyn Kelly and Sean Hannity, has arisen over Donald Trump's interview choices. The dispute was initiated when Kelly criticized Trump for limiting his interviews to Hannity, stating that he does not engage with other interviewers.\n\nDuring her television show, The Kelly File on Wednesday night, Kelly commented, \"Donald Trump, with all due respect to my 10 o'clock colleague, will go on Hannity and pretty much only Hannity and will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days, which doesn't exactly expand the tent.\"\n\nHannity responded to Kelly's statement on Twitter, posting, \"@megynkelly u should be mad at @HillaryClinton Clearly you support her. And @realDonaldTrump did talk to u.\"\n\nThis exchange marks the latest drama at the conservative-leaning cable news channel, which has been embroiled in internal discord since the revelation that its longtime CEO, Roger Ailes, allegedly engaged in serial sexual harassment over decades. Ailes resigned in July and has since become an informal adviser to the Trump campaign.\n\nKelly herself became a campaign issue in the summer of 2015 after moderating the first Republican primary debate. Trump took issue with her tough questioning and, in an interview on CNN the following day, made a comment widely interpreted as a reference to menstruation when he suggested she \"had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of wherever.\" The ensuing uproar led Trump to be banned from a major gathering of conservatives and sparked the biggest crisis of his campaign at that time.\n\nSince then, Kelly has continued to be a target of Trump, who called her \"crazy Megyn\" in March and even tweeted at her during Tuesday's vice-presidential debate. In contrast, Hannity has appeared in an advertisement for Trump and consistently speaks of the Republican nominee in glowing terms. Trump has appeared in numerous one-on-one primetime interviews with Hannity and even cited Hannity as a character witness in the first presidential debate.\n\nWhen asked why there was no evidence for his claims that he had opposed the second Iraq war, Trump stated, \"Nobody called Sean Hannity.\" However, it is a matter of record that Trump supported the invasion of Iraq in 2002.",
    " Title: House Republicans Disrupt Impeachment Probe, Alleging Lack of Fairness\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Wednesday, a group of House Republicans stormed a secure room where the impeachment inquiry against President Trump was being conducted, causing a disruption and upending a scheduled deposition. The move was met with anger from Democrats, who accused the Republican lawmakers of creating a potential security lapse by bringing electronics into the secure area.\n\nThe Republicans argued that the hearing they disrupted, involving Defense Department official Laura Cooper, was not classified, and they claimed that Democrats have violated fairness by excluding them from the impeachment process.\n\nRep. Mark Walker, a North Carolina Republican, stated, \"House Democrats are bypassing constitutional norms and basic standards of due process with their impeachment obsession. The president is not above justice. But, as you know, neither is he below it.\"\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona was more direct, asserting that the Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump's communications with Ukraine over former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a political opponent, is not following any of the precedents for impeachment proceedings.\n\nDemocrats countered that Republicans on the impeachment committees can participate and ask questions, and that they have access to transcripts and information. They argued that the Republican protesters, who are not on the impeachment committees, have no right to see what's going on.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat, threatened to bring ethics charges against the Republican protesters, and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson asked the sergeant at arms to investigate the breach of the room, known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility or SCIF.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, said the problem was that lawmakers brought in electronic devices, which are usually banned. \"And they not only brought in their unauthorized device, they may have brought in the Russians and Chinese with electronics in a secure space,\" Mr. Swalwell said.\n\nMs. Cooper ultimately testified, five hours after she was scheduled to begin. The details of her testimony remain undisclosed. Her testimony comes a day after a former U.S. diplomat to Ukraine testified that President Trump made the release of military aid to Ukraine contingent on that country investigating Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of directors of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nThe impeachment committees leading the inquiry have issued a new demand for State Department documents, including text messages from witnesses and any memos regarding efforts to press Ukraine to open investigations. Meanwhile, three Democratic senators have filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Justice Department for documents related to Ukraine.\n\nA federal judge has also ordered the State Department to begin releasing Ukraine-related documents within 30 days. These documents include communications between Mr. Giuliani and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The judge's ruling was in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by American Oversight, a left-leaning government watchdog organization.",
    " Title: Senator Rand Paul Addresses Temperament and Interview Controversies\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Rand Paul, a Republican presidential candidate, acknowledged on Wednesday the need to \"get better at holding my temper\" after clashing with two reporters over uncomfortable questions about his stance on abortion and foreign aid.\n\nDuring an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Paul denied a tendency to interrupt female reporters, stating, \"I think I've been universally short-tempered and testy with both male and female reporters.\"\n\nPaul attributed his behavior to the challenging nature of being interviewed, particularly when facing only a camera and not the reporter, and when dealing with a hostile interviewer. He expressed a preference for questions over editorializing, stating, \"I do think interviews should be questions and not editorializing. You feel somewhat at a loss at the other end.\"\n\nIn a contentious exchange with \"Today\" show anchor Savannah Guthrie, Paul objected to what he perceived as biased questioning about his foreign policy views. The interview took a turn when Guthrie detailed perceived shifts in Paul's foreign policy positions over the years. Paul attempted to interject, stating, \"Why don't you let me explain instead of talking over me, OK?\"\n\nPaul contended that his views on foreign aid have been consistent, and that his views on Iran's threat level have evolved over time. He stated, \"What I would say is that there has always been a threat of Iran gaining nuclear weapons, and I think that's greater now than it was many years ago. I think we should do everything we can to stop them.\"\n\nLater in the day, Paul bristled at a question about abortion while talking with reporters in New Hampshire. He referred to the Democratic National Committee and stated, \"Why don't you ask the DNC, 'Is it OK to kill a seven-pound baby in the uterus?'\" His comment followed a report by The Associated Press that Paul had ducked questions about his views on abortion exceptions.\n\nIn the past, Paul has clashed with other interviewers, including CNBC anchor Kelly Evans, whom he chastised in February for posing \"slanted\" questions. Paul offered Evans a suggestion on how to conduct a better interview, stating, \"So, frankly, I think if we do this again, you need to try to start out with a little more objectivity going into the interview.\"\n\nWhen asked about his testy interview with Guthrie later on Wednesday, Paul decried questions about apparent changes in his positions, stating, \"That is not journalism.\"",
    " Title: Obama Administration Announces New Policy on Deportation of Illegal Immigrant Students\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration announced a new policy on Friday that has elicited a wave of elation among illegal immigrant students, praise from Democrats and Latino leaders, and criticism from Republicans. The policy change, according to administration officials, was initiated by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who proposed using existing laws to lift the threat of deportation for large numbers of illegal immigrant students.\n\nSince the beginning of the administration, Ms. Napolitano had been increasingly criticized by Latino and immigrant advocates for perceived obstruction of President Obama's policies. Mr. Obama had pledged his support for the Dream Act, a proposal before Congress that would provide a path to legal status for illegal immigrant students, during his first campaign in 2008.\n\nThe shift in policy was reportedly aimed at easing rising impatience at the White House with Ms. Napolitano's department. A significant hurdle, White House officials said, was resistance from career staff members and enforcement agents at Immigration and Customs Enforcement to a policy adopted a year ago. This policy required them to use prosecutorial discretion in picking and choosing among illegal immigrants facing deportation, marking the first time immigration officers had been asked to make such judgments as a regular practice.\n\nThe National ICE Council, a union representing deportation agents, openly questioned the policy, stating that its members had not been consulted and that they faced serious risks in distinguishing among immigrants who had violated the law. A review, initiated in November, of more than 411,000 deportation cases before the nation's immigration courts revealed that prosecutors had halted the deportation of only 593 illegal immigrant students.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican whose political star is rising within his party, was reportedly close to introducing a bill to help illegal immigrant students by providing them with a temporary status, a proposal similar to what White House officials had in mind. There was concern among White House officials that Mr. Rubio's proposal might pre-empt the president, making it appear he did not want to work with Republicans.\n\nThe White House was also awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on the administration's lawsuit against Arizona over a tough state immigration enforcement law. Campaign officials feared an adverse decision could leave Mr. Obama empty-handed when he tried to mobilize Latino voters for the November election.\n\nA significant concern for Mr. Obama, White House officials said, was whether he had legal authority to offer relief to so many immigrants. In recent weeks, the White House counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, and Homeland Security lawyers pored over the law and concluded they were on firm ground. The main point, the officials said, was that the policy would have to be carried out case by case, meaning the workload for the immigration bureaucracy would be substantial.\n\nUnder the policy, officials are to exercise discretion in deferring deportations of immigrants who qualify for two years. A grant of deferred action, as it is formally known, allows immigrants to apply for work permits. To be eligible, they must be 30 or younger and have come to the United States before they were 16. They must be in school or high school graduates or military veterans, with no criminal records.\n\nMr. Obama was hearing often from exasperated Democratic lawmakers. Senator Durbin, who first introduced the Dream Act 11 years ago, said he advised the president recently that he would not be able to muster enough votes in the Senate to pass the bill before the November election. In a vote in late 2010, the Dream Act was blocked by Republicans in the Senate.\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" Mr. Durbin said, \"we were getting calls every week saying that young people were being deported. We would jump in and save them. But there was anger and uncertainty and fear among them.\"\n\nMr. Durbin said he had urged Mr. Obama to \"do something much more sweeping.\" Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a leading Hispanic Democrat, also prodded the White House. The Democratic leaders' message found a sympathetic hearing from Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, a former immigration reform advocate who is a senior White House adviser to Mr. Obama.\n\nIn the end, the policy shift came quickly, White House officials said, with Mr. Obama making his choice early last week, leaving officials scrambling to prepare the logistics in time for his announcement on Friday. The White House agreed that Ms. Napolitano would make the initial statements. Later, Mr. Obama went before the news cameras in the White House Rose Garden.\n\n\"As long as I'm president,\" Mr. Obama vowed, \"I will not give up on this issue.\" He called it \"the right thing to do.\"",
    " Title: Democrats Address \"Are You Better Off?\" Question at 2012 National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nThe question of whether individuals are better off now than they were four years ago has become a central topic of debate as the Democratic Party gathers for their 2012 national convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nOver the weekend, Democratic Governor Martin O'Malley provided an opening for the Republican party when he answered the \"are you better off\" question by telling CBS News' Bob Schieffer, \"No, but that's not the question of this election. The question, without a doubt, we are not as well off as we were before George Bush...\"\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan swiftly responded, stating, \"President Obama can't tell you that you are better off. Simply put, the Jimmy Carter years look like the good old days compared to where we are right now.\"\n\nDemocrats offered some quick clarifications. Vice President Joe Biden, speaking in Detroit, told supporters, \"You want to know whether we're better off? I got a little bumper sticker for you. Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive! Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motos is alive!\"\n\nMuch more is expected to be said about this topic between now and late Thursday evening, when the president is set to accept his party's nomination. As during last week's Republican National Convention in Tampa, NPR is providing coverage and analysis through their Elections Desk and It's All Politics blog. Eyder and Liz Halloran are filing reports from Charlotte this week, and Frank James will host nightly chats on the blog during the convention proceedings. Tonight's featured speakers include first lady Michelle Obama.",
    " Title: Attorney General Holder Recuses Himself from AP Leak Investigation, Announces New IRS Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder announced Tuesday that he has recused himself from the national security leak investigation involving the Associated Press (AP) and has initiated a new inquiry into the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scrutiny of conservative political groups. The comments were the first from Holder or the Justice Department on the twin Obama administration scandals that have come to light in recent days.\n\nDuring the press conference, Holder described the AP story that sparked the probe as \"a very, very serious leak\" but revealed that he had recused himself from the investigation because he had been interviewed by the FBI as part of the initial inquiry. Explaining his recusal from the leak case, Holder said he took the step \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\n\n\"I was one of the people who had knowledge of this matter. I have frequent contact with the media,\" Holder said. He added, \"I stepped aside to try to make sure this was independent and to avoid even the possibility of the appearance of a conflict.\"\n\nThe decision to subpoena AP phone records was made by Deputy Attorney General James Cole, according to a Justice Department official who asked not to be named. The leak probe was launched following an AP story last May about a counter-terrorism investigation in Yemen that involved efforts to bomb an aircraft headed for the United States.\n\nHolder stated that the leak warranted an aggressive response from the federal government. \"I have to say this is among, if not the most serious, among the top two or three most serious leaks I have ever seen. It put the American people at risk. That is not hyperbole. It put the American people at risk,\" he said.\n\nRegarding the IRS investigation, Holder announced on Friday that he had launched the probe, calling the agency's actions targeting Tea Party-related groups \"outrageous and unacceptable.\" He said the FBI was coordinating with the Justice Department to see if any laws were broken.\n\nIn a letter to the Associated Press Monday, Cole defended the decision to seek the AP's phone records. The attorney general's comments and actions come as he and the Justice Department find themselves under increasing pressure, with both Republican and Democratic senators, including Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), being critical of the administration's actions on both fronts. Holder is set to appear before Congress on Wednesday for previously scheduled hearings that have been reoriented to address the recent inquiries.",
    " Title: Trump's Twitter Tirade: A Shift in National Conversation to the \"War on Women\"\n\nArticle:\n\nTara Setmayer, former communications director for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-California) and a CNN political commentator, has provided commentary on the recent shift in the national conversation from the War on Terror to the War on Women, following Donald Trump's controversial tweets about rival Ted Cruz's wife.\n\nLast week, Trump's tweet threatening to \"spill the beans\" on Cruz's wife in response to an anti-Trump super PAC's use of a Melania Trump modeling photo in a political ad occurred amidst the aftermath of an ISIS terrorist attack in Brussels. The timing was particularly poor, as Belgium is a member of NATO, and its headquarters are in Brussels.\n\nThe tweet marked a significant change in the national discourse, with the conversation shifting from foreign policy to personal attacks on women. This shift came at a time when Trump was facing growing criticism for his lack of foreign policy knowledge, as demonstrated by his mediocre speech to pro-Israel group AIPAC and his refusal to rule out the use of nuclear weapons to fight ISIS during a Washington Post editorial board meeting.\n\nTrump's actions in the Utah caucuses, where he suffered a crushing defeat with 14% of the vote compared to Cruz's 69%, may have contributed to his Twitter war with Cruz. Although Trump handily won Arizona, he has yet to secure over 50% in any state thus far. Cruz, on the other hand, has achieved this milestone in two contests and is the only candidate to beat Trump in multiple races.\n\nThe Twitter war began with Trump's direct attack on Heidi Cruz's appearance, which some argue was a defense of his wife since spouses are traditionally considered off-limits in elections. However, Trump's actions extended beyond this defense, as he later retweeted an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz next to an appealing picture of his wife.\n\nCritics argue that Trump's reaction to the Melania photo was more about distraction than chivalry. They claim it was a form of bullying and demeaning women, as this behavior aligns with Trump's modus operandi. An honorable man, they contend, would not need to objectify another man's wife to effectively defend his own.\n\nAttacking Heidi Cruz's appearance was a direct assault against all women and young girls, who are often harshly and unfairly judged by their looks. The message this sends from a presidential front-runner is questionable.\n\nTrump has a history of throwing temper tantrums and insulting women. He has made derogatory comments about women, calling them disgusting, fat pigs, and bimbos, and has made remarks about women dropping to their knees and having a nice piece of a * * on his arm.\n\nAccording to the latest CNN poll, 73% of registered female voters in the United States have an unfavorable view of Trump. This result is consistent with a Reuters poll that found more than half of the women in this country hold a \"very unfavorable\" view of him. This presents a significant challenge for Trump in a general election if he becomes the GOP nominee against Hillary Clinton.\n\nPolitical observers had suggested that Trump should pivot toward becoming more presidential and unifying the party after his big wins on March 15. However, Trump's latest antics demonstrate once again that he lacks the temperament, judgment, and common decency to be President of the United States.",
    " Title: Hewitt Outlines Suggestions for Future Republican Elections, Debates, and Conventions\n\nArticle:\n\nHugh Hewitt, speaking at the annual RedState Gathering, outlined several suggestions for the future of Republican elections, debates, and conventions.\n\nOne of the proposals is to end open primaries. Hewitt argued that political parties are vehicles for change in government and should be protected. He also expressed concern about the process of deciding presidential candidates being influenced by non-party members, which could lead to chaos during primaries.\n\nSecondly, Hewitt suggested that the Republican National Convention should be permanently located in either Cleveland or Denver, both of which are swing states. He praised the execution of the 2016 Republican Convention in Cleveland, while criticizing the Democratic convention and previous Republican conventions in other cities. He argued that planning early and getting organized is crucial for a successful convention.\n\nThird, Hewitt emphasized the benefits of holding the Republican convention early in the election cycle, citing advantages in campaign finance and messaging for the 2020 election.\n\nLastly, Hewitt touched upon the media, praising CNN for its professionalism during the debates, but expressing a desire for more conservative moderators. He questioned why mainstream media figures should be the ones moderating debates, suggesting that conservative personalities such as Katie Pavlich, Ed Morrissey, or Guy Benson could moderate debates. Hewitt also questioned the necessity of the Commission on Presidental Debates, comparing it to a dinosaur in the process. He expressed an affinity for PBS's Jim Lehrer, but questioned whether he and Gwen Ifill were the only ones capable of moderating a presidential debate. He suggested that talent from Salem Media Group or other conservative personalities could moderate debates.\n\nHewitt described the current cycle as a transition year, stating that networks do not run the conventions or debates, and that conservatives should run the debates themselves. He also noted that the debates ratings for networks were astronomical, with only one debate (CNBC) being a complete and total disaster. He added that the media has a heavy liberal bent, and that allowing mainstream media figures to question candidates who care little about what the other side cares about is not ideal.",
    " Title: Rep. Chris Collins Resigns Ahead of Insider Trading Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Chris Collins (R-NY) has resigned ahead of a hearing related to insider trading charges. On Monday, Collins submitted a resignation letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which will be effective when it is read on the House floor during a pro forma session Tuesday, according to Pelosi's office.\n\nCollins, who had previously entered a not guilty plea in his federal criminal fraud case, has a change of plea hearing scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. The hearing was first reported by The Buffalo News. Collins faces eight counts of federal criminal charges involving conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and false statements. His trial is scheduled for Feb. 3.\n\nCollins, along with his son, Cameron, and Stephen Zarsky, the father of Cameron's future fianc\u00e9e, are alleged by federal prosecutors to have engaged in an insider trading scheme involving an Australian biotechnology company\u2014Innate Immunotherapeutics. Collins, who was on the company's board, allegedly provided nonpublic information to his son about confidential drug test results, paving the way for Cameron Collins and others to trade on that privileged information before the public could.\n\nSince Collins was indicted in August 2018 on fraud charges, half of his full-time staff has left the office. Seven of 14 full-time staffers are no longer working in the office, according to payroll records from May 2019, the most recent filing available at the Legislative Resource Center. Those who departed include his deputy chief of staff, Michael Kracker, communications director Sarah Minkel, and health policy adviser, Charlotte Pineda.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, would set the date of a special election if he were to call one before November 2020. For such an election, county party officials would select their respective party's nominees.\n\nCollins, one of President Donald Trump's earliest backers in the House GOP conference, hails from the deep-red 27th District in Western New York. Trump won the seat by 25 points in 2016, but Collins won reelection by less than half a percentage point last fall against Democrat Nate McMurray, the supervisor of the town of Grand Island.\n\nMcMurray was already seeking a rematch against Collins, and he said in a statement Monday that \"the real victims of Collins' crimes are the people of his district that he repeatedly lied to about his guilt.\"\n\nCollins' exit could boost Republicans' chances of holding onto the seat, given its partisan lean. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales has changed its race rating from Leans Republican to Solid Republican.\n\nSeveral GOP candidates are likely interested in running for Collins' seat, whether for a special election or for a full term in 2020. A trio of Republicans had already jumped in the race to challenge Collins, who, until Monday, had been non-committal about running for reelection.\n\nGOP State Sen. Chris Jacobs had the most cash on hand at June 30, the end of the second fundraising quarter, with nearly $748,000. He also loaned his campaign $325,000. Collins had claimed Jacobs was a \"Never Trumper\" for dodging questions in 2016 about his support for the president, but Politifact found that claim was false. GOP state Sen. Rob Ortt and Beth Parlato\u2014an Afghanistan War veteran and attorney\u2014were also in the race.\n\nThe Republican field could grow with Collins' departure. Two sources said another potential candidate to watch is Erie County Comptroller and former local television news reporter Stefan Mychajliw, who has been making the rounds at GOP events. State Assemblyman Steve Hawley is another potential candidate.\n\n\"There are candidates who I think will be in before we get off the phone. Things are moving fast,\" said GOP consultant Michael Caputo, who advised Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Caputo said Monday that he was launching an effort to draft Army veteran and local radio host David Bellavia for the seat, although Caputo would not rule out running himself if Bellavia chose not to run.\n\nBellavia, who was recently awarded the Medal of Honor for his service in the Iraq War, is often mentioned as a potential candidate in the district, although it is not clear if he is interested in running. He ran for the seat in 2012, losing to Collins in the GOP primary\u2014while winning a majority of the counties in the district. Bellavia discussed the 27th District race with Trump when he was awarded the Medal of Honor in June, according to a source with knowledge of their discussion. Bellavia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMcMurray may not be alone on the Democratic side in an open-seat race. Erie County Democratic Party Chairman Jeremy Zellner said in a phone interview that he was already hearing from Democrats who could be interested in running, but he noted that the party is \"laser-focused\" on next month's election for county executive.\n\n\"This district has always been a challenge for Democrats... We're looking for the strongest person who represents that community,\" Zellner said.",
    " Title: Senate Minority Leader Schumer Previews Partisan Clash Over Impeachment Trial Procedures\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, has previewed a coming partisan clash over the procedures for an impeachment trial in the Senate. Schumer has called for the Republican party to summon senior White House officials to testify as witnesses in the impeachment trial.\n\nAs of now, approximately a dozen moderate Democrats have yet to announce their voting decision for the impeachment trial, which is scheduled for Wednesday. To date, only two Democrats have indicated they will vote against impeaching President Trump, a decision that could potentially initiate a Senate trial early next year.\n\nRepresentative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota has signaled his intention to vote no. Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey also plans to oppose the impeachment articles, but he intends to switch parties, either immediately before or just after the vote, leaving his re-election prospects uncertain in his swing district.\n\nLawmakers returned to the Capitol on Monday as Congress prepared for one of the most significant weeks in recent memory. On Tuesday, they are scheduled to vote on a $1.4 trillion spending deal to prevent a government shutdown. On Thursday, lawmakers are expected to approve a new North American trade pact to replace NAFTA.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House will formally vote on the recommendations contained in the Judiciary Committee report. This report mirrors similar documents produced during the impeachment inquiries involving Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton. The report does not provide new allegations or evidence, but it offers a detailed supporting argument for the two articles of impeachment the committee approved, charging that President Trump abused the power of the presidency to enlist Ukraine in tarnishing his political rivals and obstructed Congress by blocking witnesses from testifying and refusing to provide documents.\n\nThe report states, \"President Trump has placed his personal, political interests above our national security, our free and fair elections, and our system of checks and balances. He has engaged in a pattern of misconduct that will continue if left unchecked. Accordingly, President Trump should be impeached and removed from office.\"",
    " Title: US President Trump Accuses Democrats of Dishonesty and Treason in Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nUS President Donald Trump has criticized congressional Democrats after they announced plans to summon the White House to produce documents this week in relation to the administration's dealings with Ukraine, which is at the center of an impeachment inquiry. Committees are demanding documents concerning the administration's interactions with Ukraine, and the president has accused Democratic leaders of dishonesty and even treason.\n\nDuring a joint news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, Mr. Trump called former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, \"stone-cold corrupt.\" He directed much of his anger towards House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, labeling him \"shifty Schiff,\" a \"lowlife,\" and stating he \"should resign from office in disgrace.\" He added, \"Frankly, they should look at him for treason.\"\n\nMr. Trump also stated that he believed Mr. Schiff had \"helped write\" a complaint about the call filed by a whistleblower, without offering evidence. The US president told reporters that only \"legitimate\" whistleblowers should be protected. \"This country has to find out who this person was, because that person's a spy, in my opinion,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, which may seek to remove Mr. Trump from office, stems from a whistleblower's complaint about his July 25 phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the call, Mr. Trump pressed for an investigation of his Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son, who worked for a Ukrainian gas firm that faced allegations of corruption.\n\nAs vice-president and the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine, Mr. Biden threatened to withhold US loan guarantees to the country unless it fired its top prosecutor, at a time when Hunter Biden's employer had been under official scrutiny. European countries and international bodies had also wanted Viktor Shokin fired, accusing him of failing to clamp down on corruption.\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor general who took over from Mr. Shokin has told the BBC there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. However, questions were raised at the time about a potential conflict of interest for the US vice-president.\n\nDemocrats have pointed out that Mr. Trump's call with the newly elected Mr. Zelensky took place at the same time as the US president decided to withhold military aid from Ukraine. From what has been shared of the call so far, Mr. Trump did not directly reference withholding aid, but a full verbatim transcript has not been made available.\n\nMr. Trump's opponents say he was pressuring a vulnerable American ally to interfere in the 2020 US election for the US president's personal benefit. Democrats have accused the White House of blocking congressional inquiries and refusing to respond to record requests, which has prompted the subpoena threat this week.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings said in a memo, \"I do not take this step lightly. Over the past several weeks, the committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with - or even respond to - the committees.\" The subpoena will request documents on Mr. Trump's call with Ukraine and any related items from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nMrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schiff held a joint news conference on Wednesday, defending the impeachment proceedings. \"We're not fooling around here,\" Mr. Schiff said, adding that Democrats did not want the inquiry to \"drag on.\" He also criticized the president's comments against the whistleblower as \"a blatant effort to intimidate witnesses\" and \"an incitement of violence.\"\n\nMr. Schiff has also issued a statement saying his committee never reviewed or received the whistleblower's complaint in advance, as Mr. Trump claimed. Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict, which is unlikely in this case, given that Mr. Trump's party controls the chamber. Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted and removed.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Creation of Space Force as Sixth Military Branch, Faces Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on Monday the creation of a sixth branch of the military focused on space, a move that has faced criticism from some, including senior military officials. The proposed Space Force would operate alongside the existing Air Force, with the aim of achieving \"American dominance in space.\"\n\nTrump made the announcement during a meeting of his National Space Council, stating, \"It is not enough to merely have an American presence in space. We must have American dominance in space.\" The president later added, \"We are going to have the Air Force and we're going to have the 'Space Force.' Separate but equal. It is going to be something.\"\n\nThe United States is a signatory to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which prohibits the stationing of weapons of mass destruction in space and restricts the use of celestial bodies for military purposes to peaceful purposes only. The idea of a Space Force has been proposed in the past, with proponents arguing that it would streamline the Pentagon's operations.\n\nHowever, the proposal has faced criticism from military officials, including Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein, who stated in a 2017 congressional hearing that creating a new space branch would \"move us in the wrong direction.\" The Air Force currently oversees most of the country's space-related military activity.\n\nThe move requires the budgetary approval of the U.S. Congress, which has been divided on the idea. U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, tweeted, \"Thankfully, the president can't do it without Congress because now is NOT the time to rip the Air Force apart. Too many missions at stake.\"\n\nPentagon spokeswoman Dana White stated that the department's policy board would prepare to implement Trump's order. \"Working with Congress, this will be a deliberate process with a great deal of input from multiple stakeholders,\" White said in a statement.\n\nIn December, the president signed a directive aimed at enabling astronauts to return to the moon and eventually lead a mission to Mars. The U.S. first landed on the moon in 1969, achieving a goal set by former President John F. Kennedy in 1961 and marking the end of a decade-long space race between Washington and Moscow.\n\nSince then, U.S. efforts to explore beyond the Earth's orbit have primarily focused on remote spacecraft without human crew members, though American presidents have periodically raised the idea of sending humans back to the moon or further.",
    " Title: President Obama Announces Executive Actions to Tighten Firearms Laws, Draws Criticism from NRA\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has announced his intention to meet with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday to discuss measures aimed at curbing gun violence. This follows his order to his White House team several months ago to identify \"new actions\" he can take, as Congress has failed to act on gun control legislation.\n\nThe president is expected to use executive orders to tighten federal firearms laws, with a focus on small-scale firearms sellers and background checks for gun buyers, according to Politico. The anticipated changes would require small-scale gun sellers to submit background checks for potential buyers, but they are not expected to completely close the so-called \"gun show loophole.\"\n\nObama's new plan follows the third anniversary of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a deranged gunman killed 20 children and six adults. However, the Obama-driven effort to tighten gun laws in the aftermath of the massacre failed to gain enough support for passage from Senate Democrats and Republicans.\n\nIn response to the president's renewed effort, Jennifer Baker, spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association (NRA), stated, \"President Obama failed to pass his anti-gun agenda through Congress because the majority of Americans oppose more gun-control. Now he is doing what he always does when he doesn't get his way, which is defy the will of the people and issue an executive order.\"\n\nThe president's course of action is expected to follow recommendations from Everytown, the gun-control nonprofit led by billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. This action will likely result in a rematch with the NRA, the group that led the successful attempt to defeat Obama's post-Sandy Hook efforts.\n\nIn 2014, the ATF proposed that federal officials be notified about lost firearms, but the gun industry successfully argued that voluntary reporting was sufficient. Existing law states that those who sell guns with the \"principal objective of livelihood and profit\" have to get a dealer's license through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. This means they also have to conduct a background check on buyers no matter where they sell, including online or at a gun show.",
    " Title: Voting Rights Under Threat: A Look at the Controversies and Challenges in U.S. Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe right to vote is a fundamental aspect of any democratic system. However, in several states across the United States, particularly in the past five years following the Supreme Court's decision to weaken the Voting Rights Act, the exercise of this right has become a contentious issue.\n\nRepublican-led states, predominantly representing older, white voter demographics, have implemented a series of measures aimed at making it more difficult for minority groups, such as African Americans, Hispanics, and the young, to vote or for their votes to count. These measures, backed by right-wing think tanks, are increasingly challenged in courts and met with protests on the streets.\n\nIn Alabama, a state with a significant African American population, the state has had all-white appellate court justices for a quarter-century. This is due to the practice of statewide at-large elections for both appellate and Supreme Court judges, rather than district elections, where African American candidates would have a better chance of being elected in some areas. This practice, also followed in Texas against Hispanic voters, is currently being challenged in a lawsuit filed by the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP.\n\nAlabama has employed various tactics to suppress the vote, including requiring a photo ID to vote, closing driver's license offices disproportionately in black areas, imposing a \"proof of citizenship\" mandate for voter registration, and closing polling stations disproportionately in areas with large African American populations. Get-out-the-vote efforts have been made more difficult with the passage of a ban on financial transfers from one Political Action Committee (PAC) to another, an act aimed at leading organizations working on African American turnout. Alabama has also begun the process of purging the voting rolls, and when the state legislature passed a measure giving felons who had served their sentences the right to vote, the state government refused to inform people that their rights had been restored.\n\nAcross the country, instead of making voter registration automatic and adopting same-day registration, Republican-led states are making registration more difficult. Instead of expanding voting days, they are limiting them. Instead of encouraging voter registration drives, they are adopting various measures to criminalize the activities of voter registration groups. Partisan gerrymandering continues to evolve, and hackable voting machines pose a potential threat to an honest count. Closing polling stations forces some, disproportionately those from minority or poor districts, to travel longer and wait in long lines to vote.\n\nThe only way to counter these measures is through massive citizen mobilization and electing leaders who prioritize the right to vote. In 2018, efforts to restrict the right to vote outpaced a voter turnout that was the highest since 1914. In 2020, with the fundamental direction of the country at stake, another record turnout is crucial. Upon gaining the majority in the House of Representatives in 2018, Democrats immediately passed HR 1, the most extensive election and democracy reform bill since the Voting Rights Act. The bill, which includes same-day voter registration, limits the role of big money in elections, curbs political gerrymanders, and much more, currently sits on the desk of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has refused to allow it to come to a vote.\n\nIf voters manage to overcome the obstacles designed to make voting difficult and vote in large numbers in 2020, fundamental democratic reform could be on the horizon.",
    " Title: Senate Immigration Hearing Marked by Partisan Tensions Over Boston Bombings\n\nArticle:\n\nA partisan divide emerged during a Senate immigration hearing on Monday, as top Democrats accused opponents of comprehensive immigration reform of exploiting the Boston Marathon bombings to slow or derail the bill.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) stated, \"Last week, opponents of comprehensive immigration reform began to exploit the Boston marathon bombing.\" He urged restraint and added, \"Let no one be so cruel as to try to use the heinous attacks of these two young men last week to derail the dreams and futures of millions of hard-working people.\"\n\nLeahy emphasized that the bill, crafted by the bipartisan \"Gang of Eight,\" would strengthen national security by allowing the focus of border security and enforcement efforts against those who would do harm. He also stated, \"We are capable of vigilance in our pursuit of these values, and we have seen the tremendous work that the local law enforcement as well as the federal law enforcement have done in the Boston area.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the panel's top Republican, responded sharply to Leahy's statement. He stated, \"I want you to take note of the fact that when you proposed gun legislation, I did not accuse you of using the (Newtown, Connecticut) killings as an excuse.\" Grassley also mentioned the 14 people killed in West, Texas, and some political activists who took advantage of that tragedy to warn about more government action to ensure that fertilizer factories are safe.\n\nThe hearing became more heated when Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York) said, \"Those who are pointing to what happened\u2014the terrible tragedy in Boston\u2014(are looking for an) excuse for not doing a bill or delaying it many months or a year.\" Sen. Grassley responded, \"I never said that!\" and interrupted Schumer. Schumer replied, \"I didn't say you did, sir.\"\n\nAlabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions accused Schumer of \"demeaning\" anti-reform witnesses, partly by characterizing them as representatives of narrow interests. Schumer, in turn, insisted that \"what I am saying is, if there are things that come up as a result of what happened in Boston that need improving, that require improvement, let's add them to the bill because certainly our bill tightens up things in a way that would make a Boston less likely.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) sent a letter Monday to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada), urging a delay of any immigration legislation until more is learned about the alleged Boston bombers. Sen. Paul wrote, \"We should not proceed until we understand the specific failures of our immigration system.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney dismissed Paul's concern, arguing that \"comprehensive immigration reform, as anyone who has looked into it can attest, would enhance our security.\" The bill now under consideration would prevent undocumented residents from gaining legal status if they have been found guilty of felonies or more than two misdemeanors.\n\nMonday's hearing was the second by the Judiciary Committee on the nearly 900-page proposal put together by the eight senators. Over twenty witnesses were slated to testify, a schedule characterized by Sen. Sessions as part of a plan \"to rush through this massive legislation before the American people know what's in it.\" The first hearing, held last Friday, was also marked by several references to security fears raised by the recent bombings. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is scheduled to testify before the panel Tuesday.\n\nAssuming the immigration bill clears Leahy's committee, full Senate consideration of the legislation will probably occur in June, according to multiple sources. A bipartisan group of legislators in the House of Representatives is crafting its own immigration reform proposal.",
    " Title: Obama's Executive Actions on Immigration Moving Forward Despite Court Halt on Deportation Amnesty\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama's marquee deportation amnesty, known as Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA), has been stalled by the courts, but the rest of his executive actions on immigration, announced a year ago, are progressing. The DAPA, intended to grant temporary legal status and work permits, Social Security numbers, and driver's licenses to over 4 million illegal immigrants, has been halted by a federal appeals court, with its fate soon to be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, the remaining actions announced on Nov. 20, 2014, are advancing. These actions, often mislabeled by the press as executive orders, include a wide-ranging set of priorities that effectively instructs agents not to pursue the deportation of nearly all illegal immigrants.\n\nRep. Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat, who was among the chief advocates for the unilateral steps, stated, \"There are 7 or 8 or 9 million people who are now safe under the current policy. That is a victory to celebrate while we wait for the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe actions also encompass changes to the legal immigration system, such as making it easier for spouses of guest workers to find employment, allowing foreigners who study science and technology at U.S. universities to remain and work in the country longer, encouraging legal immigrants to apply for citizenship, and waiving the penalty on illegal immigrant spouses or children of legal permanent residents, so they no longer have to leave their families to await legal status.\n\nOn enforcement, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced changes that would let most rank-and-file illegal immigrants off the hook and instead focus deportation efforts on serious criminals, gang members, and other security threats, as well as the most recent of illegal border crossers.\n\nDeportations, which peaked at nearly 410,000 in fiscal year 2012, dropped to about 230,000 in fiscal year 2015, which ended on Sept. 30. However, Mr. Johnson stated that more of those being deported are the serious criminals and security threats he wants his agents to focus on.\n\nAccording to an estimate this year by the Migration Policy Institute, if agents adhere strictly to the enforcement priorities, some 9.6 million of the estimated 11.5 million illegal immigrants in the country have no real danger of being deported.\n\nMarc Rosenblum, deputy director of the institute's U.S. immigration policy program, stated, \"The enforcement priorities announced last year, if strictly enforced, do protect the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants from being deported, because most immigrants have been here a long time and haven't committed a serious crime.\"\n\nImmigrant rights activists are still waiting for the special circumstances to be applied more broadly. Mr. Johnson has also been pushing, with some success, to get sanctuary cities to cooperate with his deportation agents. He scrapped the Secure Communities program and replaced it with the Priorities Enforcement Program, which targets only serious criminals.\n\nJessica Vaughan, policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for stricter immigration controls, stated, \"It is tremendously harder now to deport even criminals, much less garden-variety illegal aliens. They have truly dismembered the immigration enforcement system, from the Border Patrol to the immigration courts.\"\n\nThe jewel of the executive actions was the deportation amnesty, which was delayed first by a federal district court in Texas and last week by an appeals court. All sides in the debate agree that this was a significant setback for Mr. Obama.\n\nMs. Vaughan stated, \"Without being able to give away a benefit, like a work permit, these changes are less permanent, and easier to undo in some ways, than would have been the case had the president been able to implement DAPA.\"\n\nMr. Obama stated he took the series of steps in response to inaction from Congress, where his push for a broad bill granting illegal immigrants a path to citizenship stalled in 2013. Frustrated by Republicans, Mr. Obama waited until after the 2014 elections, then announced his go-it-alone approach.\n\nHomeland Security has issued proposals to carry out the leniency program for illegal immigrant spouses and children of green-card holders and to allow foreign students in science and technology to stay longer. Both of these still need to be finalized, as does a proposal expanding hardship waivers. Other moves were easier to accomplish: Homeland Security now accepts credit card payments for citizenship fees.",
    " Title: White House Launches Campaign to Refocus on Affordable Care Act Benefits\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama will initiate a three-week campaign on Tuesday, led by the White House, congressional Democrats, and their allies, to emphasize the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The renewed push aims to rebuild public confidence in the law and refocus attention on its advantages, following two months of intense media coverage of the HealthCare.gov website's rollout issues.\n\nThe White House will highlight a different benefit each day until the Dec. 23 enrollment deadline for Jan. 1 coverage. This message will be amplified through press events and social media by Democratic members of Congress, the Democratic National Committee, congressional campaign committees, and advocacy organizations.\n\nThe renewed focus on the ACA is a response to the faulty website that forced the administration into damage control mode. The White House believes that with the website now functioning more effectively, they can return to promoting the law.\n\n\"Healthcare.gov met our self-imposed November 30th deadline and even as we continue to make improvements to the website, we\u2019ll also remind the public about how the Affordable Care Act is already making a positive difference in the lives of millions of Americans today,\" said Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman.\n\nPresident Obama will not declare the website fixed during Tuesday's event. White House officials acknowledge that HealthCare.gov is not working as smoothly as it should, and the renewed messaging push will run alongside efforts to make further repairs to the insurance marketplace and to target key populations for enrollment.\n\nRepublicans are not expected to abandon their efforts to weaken the ACA, and officials have prepared for the Democratic offensive. \"Democrats will spend the next year promising to 'fix' ObamaCare, but they\u2019ve already lost all credibility with voters,\" said Brad Dayspring, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nThe focus on ACA benefits is a political necessity for congressional Democrats, who will face voters in less than a year. Democrats wrote and passed the law in the face of unified Republican opposition, and if voters are not aware of the law's upside or can't remember it amid all the problems with the rollout, Democrats will be holding onto an anchor rather than a buoy.\n\nDemocratic leaders are welcoming the renewed White House push. \"The consequences of Republican repeal are exactly the case that we need to be making\u2014because Republican repeal would take us backward to a broken system that hurts too many Americans\u2014like forcing millions of seniors to pay $1,200 more for their prescription drugs,\" said Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \"Every poll tells us that when we make that case, voters choose Democrats.\"\n\nThe White House and Democratic allies will focus on different aspects of the ACA's benefits each day, starting with less expensive preventative care on Wednesday, coverage for people with preexisting conditions on Thursday, and slowing growth in healthcare costs on Friday.\n\n\"We are able to hit reset on the conversation,\" said Lori Lodes, senior vice president of the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund. \"We have to make sure people understand how the law will benefit them.\"",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Files Cloture on Police Reform Legislation, Setting Vote Date\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) filed cloture on the Republican police reform legislation on Monday, setting an official date for the vote. The Senate will vote on the GOP's police reform bill, which requires 60 votes to pass. To advance, Republicans would need seven or more Democrats to vote with them.\n\nSenate Republicans released their police reform legislation on Wednesday in response to the killing of George Floyd and the ongoing protests. In a press conference, Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and McConnell introduced the legislation.\n\nSen. Scott stated that the legislation will include a \"notification act\" to provide more information about the over 30,000 no-knock warrants that occur nationwide. The legislation is also expected to include anti-lynching legislation that was stalled by Republican Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) in the Senate. Additionally, the legislation calls for more funding for body cameras.\n\nSen. McConnell appointed Sen. Scott (R-SC) to lead the party's effort in passing a police overhaul bill before July 4. Sen. Scott has ruled out including a revision to qualified immunity, a key measure supported by Democrats and others.\n\nThe group of Republican senators who worked on the bill includes Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ben Sasse (R-NE), James Lankford (R-OK), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV). (RELATED: Sen.

    " Title: TSA Fails 95% of Airport Security Tests, Raising Questions About Effectiveness and Budget\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent report has revealed that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) missed 95% of guns and bombs in airport security tests, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the agency and the $7 billion annual budget it receives.\n\nThe high failure rate in the tests, which were conducted at multiple airports and used realistic simulations of terrorist behavior, has led some to argue that the current level of airport security is not necessary. They contend that the TSA's primary role should be to deter potential terrorists rather than achieve a perfect security record.\n\nThe argument is that a moderate chance of being caught is enough to deter a sane terrorist, and a 95% failure rate is too high, but a 20% one is acceptable. The TSA's previous excuses, such as the results being isolated to a single airport or not representative of realistic terrorist behavior, are no longer valid, given the widespread nature of the latest tests.\n\nThe high failure rate is consistent with anecdotal evidence, with many individuals reporting having inadvertently carried knives through airport security and some having mistakenly carried guns on airplanes. The TSA's own statistics show that it detected 2,212 guns last year, but this does not necessarily mean that it missed 44,000 guns.\n\nThe reasons for the high failure rate are not clear, and the report does not provide an explanation. It is speculated that the cause may be a combination of factors, including the boredom of security screening jobs, the high number of false alarms, and technological limitations in detecting certain types of weapons or explosives.\n\nDespite the numerous failures, there have been no successful terrorist attacks against airplanes since 9/11. If there were numerous terrorists waiting for an opportunity to attack American planes, we would have seen attempts or successful attacks in the years since the implementation of airport security measures.\n\nThe article concludes that while the TSA needs to improve its performance, the actual risk of terrorism does not justify its $7 billion budget. The author suggests that the money could be better spent on intelligence and investigation, which would provide security that does not require guessing the next terrorist tactic and target. The author also emphasizes the importance of vigilant passengers and good intelligence and investigation in dealing with potential terrorists.\n\nThe article also raises concerns about the effectiveness of security measures that require guessing the terrorists' tactics and targets, as the terrorists may simply adapt their methods to evade detection. The author argues that a more proactive approach, focusing on intelligence and investigation, would be more effective in preventing terrorist attacks.",
    " Title: Labor Secretary Scalia: U.S. Economy Well-Positioned to Rebound Post-COVID-19 Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nLabor Secretary Eugene Scalia stated on Wednesday that the American economy is \"well-positioned\" to rebound following the coronavirus-related economic shutdowns across the country. During an interview on \"America's Newsroom,\" Scalia compared the current situation to a war, stating, \"As the president said, we are in a war, a war that has drawn on Americans across the country in a way I don't think we've seen since World War II.\"\n\nScalia attributed the United States' \"incredible productive capacity\" to its success in winning two world wars. He highlighted the efforts of both the front lines and the home front, including the iconic Rosie the Riveter, as examples of the ingenuity, creativity, and energy in the private sector that are helping the country turn the corner in slowing the spread of coronavirus.\n\nMeanwhile, private employers slashed 20.2 million jobs in April, according to the ADP National Employment Report released Wednesday morning. This represents the largest decline on record since the survey began in 2002, surpassing the previous record of 834,665 job losses in February 2009 during the Great Recession.\n\nAhu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, stated, \"Job losses of this scale are unprecedented.\" Yildirmaz added, \"The total number of job losses for the month of April alone was more than double the total jobs lost during the Great Recession.\"\n\nThe report may understate the actual damage inflicted by the stay-at-home measures, as the ADP study is only based on data collected through April 12. Since the virus outbreak gained a foothold in the U.S. about two months ago, forcing a majority of states to shutter nonessential businesses and direct residents to stay at home, 30 million Americans have filed for first-time jobless benefits.\n\nJob losses were concentrated heavily in the leisure and hospitality industry, with 8.6 million job losses in total, despite businesses trying to compensate with delivery and takeout options.\n\nScalia said that \"somewhere near 90 percent of people who have gone on unemployment said that they expect to return to their jobs.\" He expressed optimism that the country can quickly return to the strong economy it had under the president's policies just weeks ago.",
    " Title: Romney Criticizes Obama's Economic Policies in Response to Job Growth Report\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 Channel, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney criticized the latest Labor Department report showing a decline in job growth in America. The report, released a day after President Obama's speech at the Democratic National Convention, showed only 96,000 new jobs created in August, with hundreds of thousands of Americans leaving the workforce.\n\nRomney stated, \"It's another disappointing monthly figure.\" He further explained that the continued pattern of job creation over the last several years indicates that the U.S. is not creating the jobs needed to put Americans back to work. For every net new job created, about four people have dropped out of the workforce, according to Romney.\n\nThe former Massachusetts governor also criticized the Federal Reserve, stating that their actions will not have an immediate impact on the economy. He added that business-friendly policies from the White House are the best hope for turning around the moribund economy.\n\nRomney also expressed his dissatisfaction with President Obama's speech, stating that it lacked confidence in the President's ability to handle jobs and the economy. He claimed that there was nothing in the speech that gave confidence that the President knows what he is doing when it comes to jobs and the economy.\n\nThe unemployment rate did inch downward in August, but economists attribute this to the fact that so many out-of-work Americans have become so discouraged that they have taken themselves out of the workforce. The proportion of the adult population that is either working or looking for work fell to 63.5 percent, the lowest level in 31 years for the so-called labor force participation rate.\n\nRomney believes his private sector experience gives him an edge over Obama in the issue Americans care most about\u2014the economy. He stated that Obama's speech was a reminder of the promises he made in 2008 that have not come to fruition.\n\nRomney also addressed claims by Democrats that his own speech in Tampa was short on specifics, noting he laid out five steps he said will lead to increases in jobs and income for Americans. He also rejected former President Clinton's claim in Charlotte that \"no president\" could have turned around the economic mess Obama inherited in 2009, stating he \"could have done a heck of a lot better job.\"\n\nRomney also addressed claims that he wanted American automakers to go bankrupt, stating that the structured bankruptcy he proposed for General Motors would have allowed the company to survive without costing American taxpayers billions in bailout money. He also rejected claims that by not mentioning U.S. troops in his acceptance speech in Tampa he showed a disregard for service members.\n\nWith just 60 days to go, Romney stated that the choice will be clear for voters. He said, \"I think people will make up their mind. I can't tell you when everyone will settle down\u2014the day before or day of the election. It's a horse race [between] two candidates who would take the country in different directions.\"\n\nLater Friday, at a campaign rally in Orange City, Iowa, Romney laid out a five-point plan to create 12 million new jobs if elected, including taking \"full advantage\" of the nation's energy resources to become independent by 2020 and not catering to small businesses. He also stated that massive federal spending will end if he assumes the White House.",
    " Title: Obama to Campaign for Clinton, Emphasizing Unity and Strong Leadership\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to generate excitement and support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama is preparing to campaign for her, emphasizing his personal journey from being a critic to a supporter. This strategy is aimed at ensuring Clinton has a strong mandate to govern and gain public and Congressional support for her agenda.\n\nDavid Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager and an outside political adviser to both the president and the Clinton campaign, stated, \"You want people to feel as passionate about Hillary Clinton being president as they do about stopping Donald Trump. If this isn't a close race, it's still going to matter a great deal for her presidency.\"\n\nPresident Obama's message will be a key focus when he joins Clinton for a rescheduled joint rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on July 5. Jen Psaki, White House communications director, said, \"He can make the case as the highest profile convert to be her supporter.\"\n\nObama's campaigning will not only involve supporting Clinton but also continuing to criticize and mock Republican nominee Donald Trump. Jen Psaki noted, \"The way the president sees it is: there will be a lot of people out there talking about Donald Trump\u2014there's more than enough material.\"\n\nThe conversations around Obama's message are being led out of the West Wing, while logistics and scheduling discussions are being handled by the Clinton campaign in Brooklyn. The White House and the campaign maintain a few points of contact to minimize leaks and potential legal issues.\n\nObama and his aides believe he can appeal to skeptical sections of the Democratic base, particularly young, progressive, and anti-establishment voters who supported Bernie Sanders this year. The White House is also working on finalizing the convention speech that will be Obama's last big speech with the full political spotlight on him.\n\nPlanning the fall campaign calendar is still in progress, with the needs of the Clinton campaign and Senate candidates yet to be determined. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney noted, \"Don't discount Bill [Clinton] either.\" Bill Clinton, Hillary's husband, is expected to play a significant role in the campaign as well.\n\nDavid Plouffe stated, \"When he [Obama] speaks about her [Hillary Clinton]... I think that will obviously have more authenticity than any other messenger.\" The White House is weeks away from finalizing the convention speech that aides know will be Obama's last big speech with the full political spotlight on him.",
    " Title: Florida and Ohio Primary Polls Show Trump, Cruz, Kasich Leading; Rubio Trailing in Home State\n\nArticle:\n\nNew polls indicate that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is leading in his home state of Florida, with Sen. Marco Rubio trailing behind him significantly. According to the latest Marist/NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Trump has a double-digit lead over Rubio, with 43% to Rubio's 22%. The same poll shows Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Rubio essentially tied, with Cruz at 21% and Rubio at 21%. A separate CBS News 2016 Battleground Tracker poll shows Rubio slipping behind Cruz.\n\nIn Ohio, a Marist survey shows Gov. John Kasich holding a slight edge over Trump, with 39% to Trump's 33%. The latest Quinnipiac poll shows Trump and Kasich tied, with 38% each. The primaries in Ohio and Florida, among five Tuesday, are considered a must-win for both Kasich and Rubio, respectively, as both significantly trail front-runner Trump and Cruz in the delegate count.\n\nRubio's drop in the polls appears to be another indication that his campaign might soon come to an end. On Sunday, he continued to criticize the violence at Trump rallies, saying the candidate and protesters share the blame. Rubio's poll numbers have also fallen in the CBS News 2016 Battleground Tracker poll, with Trump maintaining his lead in the state's winner-take-all primary, in which 99 delegates are at stake. Trump has 44% of the vote among registered voters in the state, compared with Cruz at 24% and Rubio at 21%.\n\nAt a rally Sunday in Ohio, Trump hit Kasich for voting in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a congressman, a move that critics say has taken away millions of manufacturing jobs, especially in Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Illinois, and Ohio. Kasich faces a similar situation as Rubio, needing to win in his home state to keep his campaign headed toward the GOP convention in July.\n\nTrump leads the delegate count with 460, followed by Cruz with 370, Rubio with 163, and Kasich, who has yet to win a primary or caucus, with 63. The three other states on Tuesday also holding primaries are North Carolina (72 delegates), Missouri (52 delegates), and Illinois (69 delegates). Trump also leads in Illinois, with 38%, followed by Cruz at 34%, Kasich at 16%, and Rubio at 11%.\n\nOn the Democratic side, frontrunner Hillary Clinton has a big lead in Florida over rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 62-to-34%, according to the CBS poll. However, she leads Sanders by single-digits in Ohio, 52-to-43%, and Sanders has a narrow 48-46% lead in Illinois. Early voting in Florida's primary comes to an end Sunday, with more than 1.9 million voters having already made their presidential choice. Republican voters far outnumber Democratic ones, according to the latest figures released Sunday by the state Division of Elections. Republican voters account for more than 1.1 million early voters, while about 819,000 Democrats have cast ballots. Early voters are projected to account for at least half the total number expected to vote in Tuesday's primary. Florida's closed primary is open only to those registered to one of the major parties.",
    " Title: State Department Faces Criticism for Lack of Security Risk Management at Foreign Missions\n\nArticle:\n\nA year after the Benghazi terrorist attacks, the State Department is still struggling to manage security risks at foreign diplomatic missions, according to a report released by the department's internal auditor on Wednesday. The report, a \"special review\" conducted by the State Department's Office of Inspector General, criticizes the department for lacking a systematic approach to enhancing security personnel beyond the assistance provided by host nations at 27 high-risk posts. The report also highlights gaps in the department's ability to balance security needs with the necessity of being involved in volatile regions worldwide.\n\nThe OIG report concludes that the State Department \"neither has a conceptual framework nor a process for risk management.\" The report states that there is no single person or office responsible for overseeing the assessment of risk in critical, high-threat locations.\n\nHowever, the OIG report refutes claims made by prominent Republicans over the past year who argued that the Obama administration-appointed panel that investigated the September 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, was politically biased and failed to hold anyone accountable for security failures surrounding the incident. Four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, were killed when armed Islamist terrorists attacked a shoddily protected diplomatic outpost in Benghazi.\n\nRep. Darrell E. Issa, a California Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has been one of the loudest critics. He has claimed that last year's Accountability Review Board (ARB) investigation, a process mandated by federal law whenever an attack occurs on a U.S. diplomatic post overseas, fell short of uncovering the truth behind the security failures in Benghazi.\n\nThe OIG findings contradict these assertions, concluding instead that the \"Accountability Review Board process operates as intended\u2014independently and without bias\u2014to identify vulnerabilities in the Department of State's security programs.\"\n\nThe State Department welcomed the findings. \"This independent report underscores that the partisan and political assault on the ARB must end,\" department spokesman Alec Gerlach said in an email to The \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"The IG looked at all 12 ARBs conducted between 1998 and 2012 and determined that the ARB process occurs 'independently and without bias.'\"\n\nThe report also gave the ARB process a positive evaluation, stating that it operates free of bias and political pressure. However, it found mixed results regarding the State Department's implementation of the recommendations made by the ARB. For instance, one of the ARB's key findings had called for boosting U.S. assets at high-risk posts where the host countries are incapable or unwilling to protect U.S. missions. The department's actions to date do not comply with this recommendation, according to Wednesday's OIG report.\n\nThe report, however, did credit former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton for taking a direct role in ensuring the Benghazi ARB recommendations were implemented, and stated that current Secretary of State John F. Kerry is following through. \"The Benghazi ARB recommendations, when implemented, should significantly improve the department's ability to provide better security for U.S. diplomatic missions and employees,\" the report said.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush and Clint Bolick Propose Overhaul of U.S. Immigration Laws, Offering Legal Residence but Not Citizenship to Undocumented Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush, son and brother of U.S. presidents, has co-authored a new book titled \"Immigration Wars\" with Clint Bolick. In the book, they propose overhauling U.S. immigration laws to make it easier for illegal immigrants to gain legal residence, not citizenship.\n\nBush, in an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep, explains that their plan involves legalizing undocumented immigrants after they pay a fine or perform community service and have no serious criminal records. He states, \"Over a period of time, they can have a legalized status that allows them to live a life of dignity, but not necessarily a path to citizenship.\"\n\nThe authors propose that those who wish to become citizens could return to their country of origin and apply. Bush notes, \"Right now, in effect, we tell people to get in the back of the line, but the line is either so long or it doesn't exist\u2014I mean, we do not really have that option. Our proposal...would allow for that option to exist.\"\n\nClint Bolick, a lawyer and director of the Goldwater Institute's Scharf-Norton Center for Constitutional Litigation in Phoenix, explains that their proposal aims to increase the number of people who can immigrate to the United States for work. Bolick states, \"We think we ought to dramatically increase the number of people who can come for low-skilled jobs, for high-skilled jobs, for education or just because they want to become American citizens.\"\n\nJeb Bush, often mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, has not yet announced his intentions for the 2024 election. When asked about the need for Republicans to support an immigration overhaul, Bush responds, \"Being against other people's policies eventually puts you in a downward spiral. It's fine to be principled and oppose views that you don't agree with, but you also have to have an alternative.\"\n\nBush further discusses the need for spending restraint and reform of the entitlement system, emphasizing the importance of presidential leadership in driving change. He states, \"My brother did it, Bill Clinton did it, my dad did it, Ronald Reagan did it, Lyndon Johnson did it. Why is it such a hard thing for us now to expect presidents to lead?\"\n\nWhen asked about the timing of his potential presidential run, Bush responds, \"We just had an election, and a lot will happen between now and the time that I would even begin to consider something like that. So, time would be the leading indicator.\"",
    " Title: Putin Endorses Trump as \"Absolute Leader\" of U.S. Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nChristian Whiton, a former deputy special envoy for human rights in North Korea for the George W. Bush administration, is the president of the Hamilton Foundation, a principal with DC Advisory, and the author of \"Smart Power: Between Diplomacy and War.\" In a recent CNN report, Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, has expressed support for Donald Trump, the U.S. presidential candidate, calling him the \"absolute leader\" of the race.\n\nPutin, who has been running Russia since 2000, has a history of interest in American politics. The endorsement comes as Putin identifies similarities between himself and Trump, particularly their shared love for spectacle and appreciation of the impact of such spectacle on low-information voters.\n\nPutin's endorsement may be rooted in his understanding of politics as a form of showbiz, as depicted in Mel Brooks' darkly comical musical \"The Producers.\" The line \"Everything is showbiz\" from the musical could be seen as the leitmotif of Trump's campaign.\n\nTrump's approach to politics and his self-referential style are reminiscent of Putin, who has been known to exploit character flaws in political figures to further his own interests. Putin's past manipulation of American presidents, such as George W. Bush and Barack Obama, has been well-documented.\n\nTrump's statements regarding U.S. policy toward Russia have also caught Putin's attention. In September, Trump praised Putin's leadership and expressed support for Russia's actions in Syria, stating that Putin is \"getting an 'A'... He's going into Syria, and he frankly wants to fight ISIS, and I think that's a wonderful thing.\"\n\nHowever, Putin's praise of Trump's personal flaws and policy positions may be a strategic move to exploit Trump's naivety and self-delusion about Russia's intentions. Putin's actions in Syria, primarily to support the dictator Bashar al-Assad and fight Assad's non-ISIS opponents, contradict the positive image Trump has portrayed.\n\nPutin's endorsement of Trump and his stated desire for closer relations with the U.S. has raised concerns about the potential for Russia to expand its sphere of influence, particularly in light of Putin's history of aggression and suppression of domestic dissent. The endorsement serves as a reminder of the need for careful consideration and scrutiny of foreign leaders' intentions and actions.",
    " Title: Early Voting Surges in the U.S. Ahead of Election Day\n\nArticle:\n\nEvery Election Day for as long as he can remember, Angel Del Carpio would head to the polls and cast his vote. He did it when he lived in California and New York. Now a resident of Nevada \u2013 a closely watched swing state \u2013 Mr. Del Carpio decided to make an early appearance this year. The Wednesday before the election, the retired hairdresser drove to The Boulevard Mall, about three miles east of The Strip, to vote at a polling station set up inside.\n\n\"I did my part,\" says Del Carpio, holding up his \"I voted\" sticker. \"It's very important because our vote is what's going to save this country.\"\n\nDel Carpio's ballot is one of more than 34 million already cast ahead of the election this year via in-person, mail-in, or absentee ballots. The figure is on its way to topping 50 million and setting a record for votes cast before Election Day, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nEarly voter turnout remains a questionable indicator of victory. But the surge in early voting may suggest that Americans continue to value their role in the electoral process, particularly when they perceive that the stakes are high, political analysts say. And voters are eager to take advantage of ways that make it easier for them to play their part, they add.\n\n\"People want to choose the most convenient thing, especially if they're anticipating long lines\" on Election Day, says David Damore, professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\nIn this election in particular, he says, Democrats and Republicans alike tend to see a win for the other side as an existential threat. \"The importance of the outcome looms over most people,\" Dr. Damore says. \"That may not fire enthusiasm, but it becomes important to people to participate.\"\n\nAs voting options expand, the percentage of voters nationwide casting their ballots early have soared from about 11 percent in 1996 to 33 percent in 2012, Pew reports. Data for 2016 suggests the trend will hold. In states such as Nevada and Colorado, nearly half the total electorate had already cast their votes five days before the election, says Paul Gronke, founder and director of the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland, Ore. In Tennessee and Arizona, nearly two-thirds have turned in their ballots.\n\n\"That's the biggest story, the earliness,\" Professor Gronke says. His theory as to why is somewhat less optimistic: \"People are very unhappy with this campaign. They want to get it over with.\"\n\nThe notion of casting ballots ahead of Election Day has been around since the Civil War, when Republicans \u2013 in an effort to secure the soldier vote for Abraham Lincoln \u2013 pushed for legislation to allow servicemen to cast their vote while away from their home states.\n\nEarly voting for convenience, however, took shape only in the 1970s: first when Congress passed a law allowing overseas voters without legal homes in the U.S. to mail in their ballots, and then when California introduced a \"no-excuses\" law that let any registered voter cast an absentee ballot. By the 1980s, Oregon had adopted the country's first vote-by-mail election system, sending registered voters ballots that they could either mail in or drop off in person.\n\nToday, 37 states and the District of Columbia allow some form of early voting. The shift makes sense, says Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. The democratic ideal is to make it as easy as possible for people to participate, he says.

    " Title: 2020 Democratic Candidates Face Calls to Address Border Wall Stance After Beto O'Rourke's Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe call for a clear stance on the border wall issue among Democratic presidential hopefuls has gained momentum following Beto O'Rourke's statement supporting the destruction of existing barriers along the southern border with Mexico.\n\nO'Rourke, the former Texas Democratic congressman, called for the demolition of the El Paso wall after the White House announced President Trump's intention to declare a national state of emergency to fund the remainder of his border wall project. During an interview on MSNBC, O'Rourke confirmed he would remove the wall, stating, \"Yes, absolutely. I'd take the wall down.\"\n\nO'Rourke's stance has prompted questions for other potential 2020 Democratic candidates, including Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Julian Castro, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, regarding their views on the existing border walls.\n\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has signaled an openness to O'Rourke's proposal, stating, \"I could look at it and see which part he means and why and if it makes sense I could support it.\"\n\nRepublicans have seized the opportunity to portray Democrats as extreme and pro-open borders, with Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) tweeting, \"Correct me if I am wrong, but did Beto say he would tear down existing border fencing and walls?\"\n\nNot all Democrats have embraced the idea of tearing down existing walls. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) stated during an interview on Fox News' \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" last month that border walls \"obviously\" work in some areas and rejected suggestions that barriers should be removed where they already exist.\n\nIn January, Democratic Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar told CNN that walls do not work and suggested she was open to destroying existing walls, describing them as \"really ugly\" and \"monuments to division.\"\n\nThe border wall issue has become a potential litmus test for the 2020 Democratic field, with O'Rourke being the first likely candidate to call for tearing down walls, while other lesser-known Democrats have suggested support for the idea in recent weeks.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Obama's Deportation Amnesty, Potential 4-4 Split Possible\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court grappled with the legality of President Obama's deportation amnesty on Monday, as conservative justices questioned the president's encroachment on Congress's lawmaking powers, while liberal justices argued for non-intervention, leaving the president with a potential free hand. Outside the courthouse, thousands of Hispanic rights activists rallied, demanding leniency from the justices and vowing political retribution on Congress, particularly Republicans, if President Obama loses the case.\n\nInside the courtroom, attorneys debated the intricacies of immigration law and the intentions of Congress when it stated that illegal immigrants should be deported but provided only enough funding for a small fraction. Texas and 25 other states argued that it is time for the high court to get involved, and they appeared to have allies among the four Republican-appointed justices, who questioned the president's power to grant temporary legal status.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is expected to be a key voice in the decision, stated, \"It's as if the president is setting the policy and the Congress is executing it. That's just upside down.\"\n\nAt issue is a set of policies announced by President Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in November 2014. One of these policies set deportation priorities, carving most illegal immigrants out of any danger of deportation, a policy not being challenged. However, another policy granted as many as 5 million illegal immigrants with children who have legal status in the U.S. a three-year stay of deportation, accompanied by work permits, entitling them to driver's licenses and some taxpayer benefits, including Social Security.\n\nPresident Obama argued that since he is not going to deport them anyway, it makes sense to let them enter the legal economy, where they will earn better wages and help the economy overall. The four Democrat-appointed justices seemed to agree.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, the only Hispanic member of the court, stated, \"They are here whether we want them or not.\" She argued that what President Obama did appears to be in line with actions of previous presidents, who deferred deportations and offered work permits to illegal immigrants caught in a legal limbo in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nWith the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, a 4-4 split is possible. In such a case, the lower appeals court's ruling, which decided 2-1 that President Obama's amnesty violated immigration law, would remain in place. This would also leave for future courts the biggest questions over the extent of presidential powers, limits that President Obama has repeatedly tested.\n\nDuring oral argument on Monday, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. read out a quote from one of more than a dozen times President Obama said he did not have such expansive powers. \"What was he talking about?\" the chief justice prodded Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., President Obama's liaison to the high court. Mr. Verrilli stated that President Obama must have changed his mind after asking the Justice Department's legal advisory branch to take a closer look.\n\nPresident Obama's amnesty has been controversial among voters overall but is very popular with Hispanics, who are a growing power in elections. Hispanic leaders have vowed to rally their community to punish Republicans for their strict stance on illegal immigration, and they made that clear at rallies in front of the Supreme Court on Monday.\n\nThe case, United States v. Texas, has drawn intense interest from Congress, where Democrats and Republicans filed opposing briefs, and from activists on issues ranging from presidential power to immigration law to business interests. \"This has tremendous political valence,\" Justice Stephen G. Breyer said. However, the possibility of a 4-4 tie could sap much of the energy from the case, since it would mean the court would not issue a definitive opinion on the limits of presidential power.\n\nThe court had asked all sides to submit briefs on whether President Obama was violating the Constitution's admonition that the president \"take care\" that the laws are faithfully executed, but there was no discussion of that during oral argument. The liberal justices also questioned whether Texas even had standing to sue in the first place, doubting the state's worry that it will face a flood of new illegal immigrants and will have to subsidize driver's licenses and pay for other benefits for the folks who qualify for President Obama's policy. Justice Sotomayor stated that if Texas could sue to stop immigration policy like this, it would open the door for states to sue any time they find fault with a federal policy, making judges the referees in myriad disputes. \"That really pits the states against every federal agency,\" she said.",
    " Title: Clinton Employs Animal Impersonations in Nevada Campaign Rally\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to secure victory in the upcoming Nevada caucuses, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton employed animal impersonations during a campaign rally in Reno on Monday. The former secretary of state mimicked a barking dog to fact-check potential false statements made by political opponents, specifically referencing the Great Recession.\n\nClinton's humorous anecdote began with a recollection of a political ad that aired on the radio in Arkansas, featuring a dog that supposedly barked whenever a candidate made an untrue statement. Clinton, before yelping, \"Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!\" to general applause, said, \"We need to get that dog and follow him around, and every time they say these things, like, 'oh, the Great Recession was caused by too much regulation,'\" Clinton said, mimicking the dog's barks.\n\nClinton and her opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, have been actively campaigning in Nevada in recent days. On Sunday, they found themselves at opposite ends of a pew in the same Las Vegas church.\n\nSanders' ground game is reportedly catching up to Clinton's campaign machine. The self-proclaimed Democratic socialist's campaign has over 100 staffers on the ground and has more than doubled its paid staff in Nevada since last month, along with spending double on television ads compared to Clinton - $2.93 million to Clinton's $1.46 million.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the Nevada caucuses is heightened by a relative lack of polling and a sense of momentum behind Sanders following his resounding victory over Clinton in the New Hampshire primary last week. Clinton opted to skip a campaign event in Florida, sending her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to stump in her stead.\n\nAs in Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders has publicly pinned his hopes in Nevada on voter turnout. \"Everything in my political gut tells me that we have the momentum here in this state,\" he told a rally in Las Vegas Sunday. \"And if people come out in large numbers on caucus day, we're going to win.\"\n\nIt is possible to win the Nevada caucuses but lose the all-important battle for Democratic National Convention delegates. That's exactly what happened to Clinton in 2008 against then-Senator Barack Obama.\n\nThe Clinton campaign may not have helped its cause in Nevada with comments made last week by campaign spokesman Brian Fallon, who compared Nevada to the more racially and ethnically homogenous Iowa and New Hampshire. \"There's an important Hispanic element to the Democratic caucus in Nevada,\" Fallon said. \"But it's still a state that is 80 percent white voters. You have a caucus-style format, and [Sanders will] have the momentum coming out of New Hampshire presumably, so there's a lot of reasons he should do well.\"\n\nThis remark reportedly angered allies of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, with one telling Politico that Reid had \"pushed hard to move Nevada near the front of the primary calendar precisely because of its diversity.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Criticizes Alleged Meeting Between Democrat Senators and Iranian Foreign Minister\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint press conference with Ethiopian Foreign Minister Gedu Andargachew on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addressed reports that a number of Democrat Senators had secretly met with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif during the Munich Security Conference.\n\nPompeo stated, \"I have seen that piece about some senators meeting with Foreign Minister Zarif. This guy is designated by the United States of America. He\u2019s the foreign minister for a country that shot down a commercial airliner and has yet to turn over the black boxes. This is the foreign minister of a country that killed an American on December 27. And it\u2019s the foreign minister of a country who is the largest world sponsor of terror and the world\u2019s largest sponsor of anti-Semitism.\"\n\nThe initial report of the alleged secret Zarif meeting was first published by The Federalist, stating, \"Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and other Democratic senators had a secret meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during the Munich Security Conference last week.\" Murphy's office did not respond to repeated requests for comment by press time.\n\nZarif was designated for sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department last summer for sponsoring terrorism around the world. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated at the time, \"Javad Zarif implements the reckless agenda of Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, and is the regime\u2019s primary spokesperson around the world. The United States is sending a clear message to the Iranian regime that its recent behavior is completely unacceptable.\"\n\nSenator Murphy, along with other Democrats, have repeatedly worked to preserve the Iranian Nuclear Agreement. The United States officially left the deal, struck during the Obama administration, in 2018.\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry, who has been openly undermining U.S. foreign policy since President Trump took office in 2017, was also seen with Zarif in Munich.\n\nPompeo referred to a commercial airline flight that had 176 innocent people on board from Iran, Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan, Germany, and Great Britain. The Iranian government lied about shooting down the plane for days and blamed the crash on engine failure. The regime arrested the individual who took video of two missiles being launched at the aircraft, leading to its demise.\n\nUPDATE: Senator Murphy has confirmed he did in fact meet with Zarif in Munich.",
    " Title: U.S. Presidential Race: Free Trade Emerges as a Clear Casualty Amid Economic Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing presidential race, free trade has emerged as a significant casualty, with both major parties expressing growing opposition to trade agreements. According to exit polling, a majority of voters view free trade as an economic burden on the U.S., costing American jobs.\n\nNotably, the opposition within the Republican Party is higher than among Democrats, a shift that challenges conventional wisdom, which traditionally positions Democrats as the free trade opponents due to their ties with labor unions. In Wisconsin's primary, only a third of Republican voters believed free trade creates American jobs, while a staggering 54% held the opposite view. Among Democratic primary voters, the numbers were more evenly split, with 41% saying free trade helps jobs and 42% saying it costs the country jobs. Similar results have been observed in states including Illinois and Mississippi.\n\nMatthew J. Slaughter, dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, attributes this shift in attitudes to the downward pressures on American earnings in recent years, regardless of political affiliation.\n\nThe economic downturn and the ready target of trade have pushed both parties' presidential candidates toward protectionism. Four out of the five remaining candidates oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-nation deal signed by President Obama but yet to be submitted to Congress for final approval.\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner, has threatened to scrap not only the TPP but also previous agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This has forced Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump's closest competitor and the winner of Wisconsin's primary, to adopt a tougher stance on the issue.\n\nIn the Democratic race, Sen. Bernie Sanders has made his opposition to trade deals a key campaign point, and front-runner Hillary Clinton has been playing catch-up, recanting her previous praise for TPP as a secretary of state and now stating that the deal signed by her former boss, Mr. Obama, falls short.\n\nHowever, she has been surprised by how effectively Mr. Sanders has used the issue against her. \"We need a president who doesn't just rail against trade. We need a president who knows how to compete against the rest of the world and win,\" she said in a Twitter post after Mr. Sanders won the Democratic primary in Wisconsin.\n\nOnly Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is trailing in the Republican race, remains a supporter of the TPP.\n\nWhile economists can calculate the benefits to the overall U.S. economy from trade, these benefits do little to comfort those who lose out, and these are the voices to which the candidates are responding.\n\nGene M. Grossman, a Princeton University professor who has studied the politics of trade, notes that trade is always a hard sell in difficult times. \"What's needed in such times is leadership from some with a longer horizon and broader vision. Alas, such leaders seem to be in short supply these days,\" he said.\n\nThe near-uniform opposition at the top of the ticket this year could doom the chances for trade deals for years to come, though some analysts see a brief opening this year, with both President Obama and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan supporters of a deal while their window of opportunity is closing.\n\nSimon Rosenberg, a longtime trade supporter and founder of NDN, a center-left think tank, hopes that Mr. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell somehow manage to get the TPP passed during an Obama presidency.\n\nThe Democrats' confliction on trade has long been apparent in Washington, where the party has experienced deep rifts. However, the Republican voters' aversion to free trade is striking given the near-monolithic support for free trade agreements by the party's officeholders in Washington. In the vote last year to grant President Obama fast-track powers to negotiate trade deals, nearly 80% of House Republicans and 90% of Senate Republicans voted in favor.\n\nSince then, as the presidential campaign has intensified, so has opposition among Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who voted for the fast-track powers, now has serious questions about the TPP deal reached with those powers. He has told President Obama not to submit the deal until after the elections, leaving a lame-duck Congress as the only chance for passage.\n\nRosenberg suggests that the Republican opposition isn't surprising, as it's been Democrats who have advanced every major trade deal of the last century. He notes that NAFTA, the creation of the World Trade Organization, and normalized trade relations with China were all Democratic priorities, with President Obama completing the TPP. \"The truth is the heavy lifting on trade has been done by Democrats, and the Republicans haven't been nearly as involved in putting together the deals and the legislative pieces to get these done in the way Democrats have,\" he said.",
    " Title: Attorney General William Barr Skips House Hearing on Mueller Report, Tensions Escalate Between Congress and Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Attorney General William Barr did not attend a House hearing on Thursday regarding special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, leading to a confrontation between lawmakers. This is the latest escalation of tensions between President Donald Trump's administration and the House of Representatives, which has launched wide-ranging investigations into the president.\n\nTrump's administration has stated its intention to fight lawmakers' demands for information and has taken legal action to block some of these demands. Barr refused to testify before the House Judiciary Committee about Mueller's Russia report because the committee agreed to add an hour of questions by staff lawyers. The hearing was to have been Barr's second day of testimony about the investigation and his handling of the special counsel's final report.\n\nChairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) accused the Trump administration of ignoring subpoenas and refusing to testify, a pattern he said reflects an effort to prevent Congress from providing any check whatsoever to even the most reckless of the president's decisions.\n\n\"The challenge we face is that if we don\u2019t stand up to him together, today, then we risk forever losing the power to stand up to any president in the future,\" Nadler said.\n\nRep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) brought a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken into the House hearing room to mark Barr's absence. The top Republican on the panel, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, called the meeting a \"circus political stunt\" that prevented Barr's testimony for lawmakers of either party.\n\n\"They want it to look like an impeachment hearing because they won't bring impeachment proceedings,\" Collins said.\n\nNadler said Barr did not attend because he was afraid of being questioned by trained lawyers. The clash marked the latest confrontation over congressional investigations into Trump and his administration. Lawmakers contend they are being stonewalled across a variety of inquiries by an administration that ignores subpoenas and avoids testimony, but Trump says the partisan requests are presidential harassment.\n\nThe Justice Department refused Wednesday to provide an unredacted version of the Mueller report to Congress despite the subpoena deadline. Barr redacted portions dealing with grand jury testimony, information about pending cases, intelligence gathering secrets, and information that could infringe on the privacy of people who were not charged.\n\nCongressional Democrats insist they deserve to receive the full report and the underlying information that Mueller's team gathered during 22 months. In a letter Wednesday to Nadler, the Justice Department's Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the committee has not \"articulated any legislative purpose for its request\" for documents relating to Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"The committee has no legitimate role in demanding law enforcement materials with the aim of simply duplicating a criminal inquiry \u2013 which is, of course, a function that the Constitution entrusts exclusively to the executive branch,\" Boyd wrote.\n\nNadler said in an opening statement facing an empty chair for Barr that lawmakers must come together to protect the integrity of the House.\n\n\"Every member of this committee should understand the consequences when the executive branch informs us that they will simply ignore a congressional subpoena,\" Nadler said. \"The challenge we face is also bigger than the Mueller report.\"\n\nCollins said Democrats wanted a circus rather than to pose questions to Barr.\n\n\"Not hearing from him is a travesty for this committee today,\" Collins said.\n\nMueller's report identified \"systematic\" efforts by the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 election by hacking emails and posting disinformation to help Trump win, and it detailed how Trump and his aides appeared to welcome that help. It found no conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia, and it did not reach a conclusion about whether Trump sought to obstruct justice.\n\nAfter Thursday's abbreviated hearing, Democrats said they supported Nadler's plan to negotiate with the Justice Department for \"a few more days\" to obtain the full report.\n\n\"The next step is to hold the attorney general in contempt for failing to comply with our subpoena,\" Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) said. Another step would be to subpoena Barr to testify. Democrats plan to call Mueller to testify, tentatively scheduled for May 15.",
    " Title: Senate Cloture Vote on Budget Compromise Hinges on Internal GOP Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming cloture vote on the short-term budget compromise in the Senate on Tuesday primarily rests on the 14 Republicans on the Appropriations Committee. Six of these members are up for reelection in 2014, and some may choose to oppose the deal. However, this leaves more than enough support for Democrats to reach the 60 votes required, given the backing from fellow Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe recent decision by Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) to seek reelection could potentially impact the chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee. Cochran could lay claim to the position at the expense of Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the current ranking Republican. A spokesperson for Shelby stated that the potential competition with Cochran has no bearing on his opposition to the budget deal. However, Shelby's office announced that he will vote against cloture on Tuesday.\n\nThe internal Republican politics within the Senate Appropriations Committee could overshadow the budget deal itself. By opposing cloture, Shelby may help himself become chairman, but if he kills the deal, the committee's effectiveness could be compromised. Many on Appropriations view Tuesday's vote as existential, as the budget agreement would negate sequestration in January, reset the Budget Control Act with more manageable caps on discretionary spending for fiscal 2014 and 2015, and allow the Appropriations Committee to regain its relevance in the Congress.\n\nThe contrast between House and Senate Republicans could not be more stark. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) worked hard to secure support for the deal within his committee, losing only two votes. Equally important, Republicans on House Appropriations from seven states, also represented by Republicans on the Senate committee, voted for the deal. These states were Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, Mississippi, and Tennessee, represented in the Senate by Shelby, John Boozman, Jerry Moran, Mitch McConnell, Mike Johanns, Cochran, and Lamar Alexander, respectively.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) expressed bafflement as to why this is a close call for her fellow Republicans on Appropriations, stating, \"I would think appropriators would welcome the chance to have a top-line and write our bills. We Republicans have said for years that we want to get back to normal order and a budget. Now we have a bipartisan agreement negotiated by a conservative House budget chairman. Why is this close?\"",
    " Title: Republican Memo Fails to Exonerate Trump on Collusion and Obstruction Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recently released Republican memo, drafted by Representative Devin Nunes, has failed to clear President Donald Trump of allegations of collusion with the Russians or obstruction of justice, as claimed by Mr. Trump. The memo, instead, confirmed that contacts between former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and Russian intermediaries, not the material from former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele's dossier, were the primary factors in the opening of the investigation in July 2016.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the document, viewing it as a tactic to undermine the ongoing investigation and protect Mr. Trump. They argue that the Democratic memo, yet to be released, will reveal that the FBI was more forthcoming with the surveillance court than Republicans had claimed. According to sources familiar with the Democratic document, it is said to disclose that the FBI informed the court that the information it received from Steele was politically motivated, although it did not name the Democratic National Committee or Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nOn Monday, when confronted with Democratic claims that such a disclosure was included in the application, Mr. Nunes admitted on Fox & Friends that there was a \"footnote\" to that effect. However, he characterized its inclusion as a \"far cry from letting the American people know that the Democrats and the Hillary campaign paid for dirt that the FBI then used to get a warrant.\"\n\nDemocrats also contest Republican claims that Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy director of the FBI at the time, had testified before the Intelligence Committee late last year that the agency would not have sought a wiretap of Carter Page, a former Moscow-based investment banker under investigation once before, without Steele's dossier of information.\n\nThe FBI suspected that Page was acting as a Russian agent. In response to the ongoing investigation, The New York Times filed a motion on Monday asking the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to unseal all materials related to the wiretap of Page, including the FBI's application for the warrant and other court documents. Since the enactment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978, no such wiretapping application materials have been made public.",
    " Title: House Republicans Unveil American Health Care Act, Replacing Obamacare with Challenges Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans have unveiled the American Health Care Act, a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The new legislation, which follows GOP principles, effectively repeals the individual and employer insurance mandates, replacing them with tax credits for individuals to purchase their own policies.\n\nThe plan also overhauls Medicaid, a federally supported health care program for the poor, which many Republicans view as too costly as the federal debt approaches $20 trillion. However, independent analysts question the plan's ability to provide \"insurance for everybody\" and cover people while reducing costs.\n\nG. William Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, estimates that 8 million to 12 million fewer people would be covered under the GOP plan, while the ACA added coverage for more than 20 million people. The independent Congressional Budget Office has yet to report on the plan's costs or its effect on the number of insured.\n\nThe plan faces opposition from both conservative and moderate Republicans. Conservatives view the tax credits as a new \"entitlement\" program, while moderates argue that the tax credits are too meager to help low-income Americans. Many Republican governors, who expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, are also expected to object to reduced outlays under the House plan.\n\nThe American Health Care Act includes several key provisions:\n\n1. Dropping the individual and employer mandates by repealing their penalties immediately, with insurers imposing a 30 percent premium increase for consumers who let their coverage lapse.\n2. Replacing subsidies with tax credits that can be applied to private plans. The credits, based on age, range from $2,000 to $4,000 for individuals and up to $14,000 for families.\n3. Funding Medicaid expansion fully through 2019, after which funding will decline. A $100 billion \"stability fund\" will be available to all states to lower health costs.\n4. Continuing popular parts of Obamacare, such as allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance until age 26 and prohibiting denial of coverage for a preexisting condition.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) stated that the plan would \"drive down costs, encourage competition, and give every American access to quality, affordable health insurance.\" However, Democrats strongly disagree, even as premiums have risen and choices have declined in many Obamacare insurance markets.\n\nRepublicans will have to pass the plan using a budget process known as \"reconciliation,\" which requires only a majority vote for passage in both houses of Congress. However, even this low threshold seems elusive given Republican division over the plan.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) stated, \"It still looks like Obamacare-lite to me. It's going to have to be better.\" Two other Senate conservatives and four GOP senators from states that expanded Medicaid have voiced similar objections. The concerns over changes to Medicaid are well-founded, according to Daniel Derksen, director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona. The capping and then cutting of Medicaid eligibility and funding over several years shifts costs and risks from the federal government to states, rural hospitals, physicians, and individuals and their families.\n\nPassing health-care reform took more than a century, as Presidents Harry Truman, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton witnessed. It required a filibuster-proof effort of 60 votes in the Senate for President Obama to get there. \"The House bill starts the process,\" writes political science professor and health-care policy expert Lawrence Jacobs. \"The question is whether it has a future.\"",
    " Title: Top Democrats Caution Against \"Blue Wave\" Predictions for Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nTop Democrats are urging caution about predictions of a \"blue wave\" sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill, as fresh signs indicate that the midterms could be much closer than anticipated. With just over two weeks to go before the critical elections, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez stated Monday that he does not use the term \"blue wave\" to describe a possible Democratic victory.\n\nPerez, who was speaking to CNN, predicted a tight race for control of Congress. \"We always knew that this election was going to be close\u2014I don\u2019t use the term 'blue wave,' I always talk about the need for the blocking and tackling,\" Perez said. \"I always talk about the need for organizing, to make sure you\u2019re leading with your values, and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been winning throughout this year and throughout 2017.\"\n\nDespite this, Perez expressed confidence that Democrats will take control of the House and win in a number of gubernatorial races. \"I don\u2019t think the Democratic advantage has ebbed,\" Perez said. \"We\u2019re talking about the issues that matter most to people.\"\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders cast further doubt on the \"wave\" narrative. \"A lot of people talk about this 'blue wave' and stuff,\" Sanders told The Hill. \"I don\u2019t believe it.\" Sanders, an independent who ran for president in 2016 as a Democrat, added: \"I happen to think that on election night we\u2019ll find a very, very close situation, and maybe a handful of votes determining whether Democrats gain control of the House.\"\n\nThe cautious comments come as the shifting midterm landscape reflects a Republican advantage in the Senate and a tough fight for control of the House, which could be determined by just a handful of races. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Monday on \"America\u2019s Newsroom\" that the GOP should hold the Senate and has a shot at the House.\n\nThe statements from Perez and Sanders stand in stark contrast to the optimism displayed last week by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi, D-Calif., expressed little doubt of a major Democratic victory in the midterms during a speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.\n\nPelosi, who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel, said, \"I think if the election were today, we would win the majority.\" However, an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll released over the weekend found that Democrats continue to hold a sizeable lead in the closing weeks before the midterms, but noted that in districts rated as the most competitive by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, they are now in a dead heat with Republicans on the question of which party should control Congress.",
    " Title: Former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort Faces Trial for 18 Criminal Counts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe first trial to emerge from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe is set to commence on Tuesday, as former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort appears before a federal judge in Alexandria, Virginia. Manafort is facing 18 criminal counts, including bank and tax fraud, which could potentially result in a 30-year prison sentence. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nThe charges against Manafort stem from his lobbying activities in Ukraine on behalf of politicians with ties to Russia. Prosecutors have alleged that he was paid over $60 million for his work, which includes support for former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.\n\nGovernment attorneys claim that Manafort engaged in a scheme to conceal his income from the Internal Revenue Service and other authorities in the United States. Instead of paying taxes on the income, they assert that he used it to support a lavish lifestyle that included owning three homes, a $21,000 watch, a $105,000 car, and New York Yankees season tickets.\n\nApproximately 500 pieces of evidence and up to 35 witnesses are expected to be presented by prosecutors. One of these witnesses is Manafort's former business associate Rick Gates, who was charged alongside Manafort but pleaded guilty and has cooperated with Mueller's team.\n\nManafort's work as a Ukrainian political operative occurred nearly a decade before he joined the Trump campaign in mid-2016. He organized the Republican convention in July 2016, but resigned from President Trump's team one month later.\n\nProsecutors have stated that they will not present evidence of Russian collusion during Manafort's trial, but have claimed they have the authority to prosecute him under a May 2017 order by Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein.\n\nManafort's attorneys have challenged that order, claiming that Mueller exceeded his authority. District Judge T.S. Ellis III, who is overseeing the Virginia trial, denied their motion, holding that Mueller's mandate authorizes him to pursue charges in the case.\n\nThe Virginia trial marks the first of two trials that Manafort will face this year. He has a September trial scheduled in Washington, D.C., on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent and making false statements to investigators.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney's Closing Arguments: A Look at Their Final Messages Before the 2012 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final two weeks of the 2012 presidential race, both candidates, Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama, are making their closing arguments. With few opportunities remaining to significantly shift the race, both campaigns are relying on strong turnout operations and well-crafted messages to secure a slight advantage.\n\nPresident Obama, in a 60-second TV ad released Tuesday, outlined his plans for the next four years, focusing on education, manufacturing, energy, and deficit reduction. This move by the Obama campaign appears to be an attempt to counter criticism of a thin second-term agenda, as the president's specific policy proposals are now more clearly presented in a list-like format.\n\nObama senior adviser David Axelrod stated on a conference call that the new tactics are not a response to the \"where's the beef\" criticism, but rather a reflection of the campaign's entry into the closing argument phase. Axelrod explained, \"Obviously, a lot of people have made up their minds. There is a small universe of voters who haven't. We want to make sure those voters have access to the information they need.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Romney spokesman Kevin Madden, speaking to reporters onboard the campaign plane, expressed confidence in Romney's performance during the foreign policy debate, stating, \"I think many swing voters looked at the foreign policy debate last night, and they were asking themselves, 'Does Gov. Romney pass the commander in chief test? And clearly he did. He also gave people a sense of confidence that he has a plan for what he wants to do over the next four years as it relates to positioning America around the globe, and that they feel safer and more secure that he does have a plan.'\"\n\nThis article provides a neutral and factual account of the candidates' closing arguments, without personal commentary or speculation.

    " Title: White House and House Speaker Disagree on Fiscal Cliff Plan B\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has rejected House Speaker John Boehner's proposal for a fall-back plan to avoid the impending fiscal crisis, a move that Boehner's office described as \"defying common sense.\" The disagreement comes as both sides approach a potential middle ground in private negotiations, but differences remain.\n\nBoehner introduced his alternative plan on Tuesday, calling for taxes to rise only on households with an income exceeding $1 million. His plan also includes entitlement cuts and a tax reform debate for next year. The White House, however, criticized the plan, stating that it does not ask enough from the wealthiest taxpayers and could not pass the Senate.\n\nIn response, Boehner's spokesman, Brendan Buck, argued that the White House is \"moving the goal posts\" and is threatening every American family with higher taxes. Boehner, with his leadership at stake, is trying to navigate a tightrope in negotiations as the president demands tax hikes that many Republicans oppose.\n\nBoehner's call for a \"Plan B\" could serve as a failsafe option if he is unable to secure the votes for any future deal with the White House. However, it could also be aimed at pushing Obama to compromise more. A Boehner aide stated that the speaker is \"hopeful an agreement will be reached,\" but expressed concern that the president's latest counteroffer includes $1.3 trillion in revenue increases and only $850 billion in spending cuts.\n\nHouse Republican Leader Eric Cantor is also putting pressure on the president, stating that the \"alternative plan\" is being discussed in case Obama \"cannot come our way.\" Without a deal, tax rates would rise for everyone, with middle-income families facing a roughly $2,000 increase next year. Capital gains and dividends rates would also go up, and long-term unemployment aid would expire.\n\nFor taxpayers, a host of benefits and tax provisions are at stake. With a deal, most Americans would likely be spared major tax increases, but those making above a certain threshold could still be affected, depending on what both sides agree to. Certain entitlement programs could also be cut, including Medicare and Social Security. Obama has indicated he is willing to agree to smaller cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients.\n\nIn terms of logistics, the House is tentatively planning to take up the \"Plan B\" proposal later this week, as early as Thursday. They would do so by amending a bill previously passed by the Senate that tracks more with Obama's original offer. Then, the House would send the bill back to the Senate, where it would likely sit as a potential last resort in case Obama and Boehner cannot strike a deal.\n\nThe Boehner alternative plan received mixed reviews from Republican House members on Tuesday, but on the Democratic side, leaders expressed swift opposition even before the White House came out against it. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's office stated that Boehner's \"plan B\" is \"the farthest thing from a balanced approach\" and will not protect middle-class families because it cannot pass both Houses of Congress. House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer called it a \"political ploy,\" and Democratic leaders urged their members to vote against it.",
    " Title: Federal Report Predicts Slight Increase in U.S. Health Care Spending Over Next Decade Due to Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. government has released a new estimate indicating that the country will spend slightly more on healthcare over the next decade due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. According to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, the ACA is expected to add $478 billion to healthcare costs over the next decade, resulting in a slightly faster rate of spending growth compared to if the law had not been passed.\n\nThe CMS report states that, if upheld by the Supreme Court later this month, the ACA will cause average spending growth to increase by one-tenth of a percent per year more than it would have without the law. Republicans have criticized the ACA, arguing that the data proves the law will not address the issue of rising healthcare costs.\n\nIn response, the administration has defended the ACA, stating that Americans' out-of-pocket expenses will decrease beginning in 2014, particularly in relation to prescription drugs. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius wrote in a blog post that the law will return \"real money\" to the pockets of millions of Americans.\n\nThe CMS report also indicates that health care spending is expected to grow at unusually low levels in the next year due to the slow economic recovery. However, spending growth will increase significantly in 2014, rising from 3.8 percent in 2013 to 7.4 percent in 2014 as major provisions of the ACA take effect. Spending growth will remain higher for several years, before dropping to around 6 percent annually.\n\nBy 2021, federal, state, and local governments will make up nearly 50 percent of all healthcare spending in the U.S., up from 46 percent in 2011. Republicans have criticized the ACA, stating that it does not fulfill President Obama's promise to control the growth of healthcare costs as a percentage of the American economy.\n\nThe CMS report's projections have changed little since last summer, when the agency first projected that the ACA would cause healthcare spending to increase slightly over the next decade. The administration has dismissed the data, stating that the ACA only appears to raise spending because it is measured against unusually low recent growth rates during the economic recession.\n\nKey provisions in the ACA, such as bringing more healthy Americans into insurance pools, allowing Medicare to experiment with new \"bundled payment\" methods, and cutting down on emergency room visits by mandating coverage for everyone, could help control spending further. However, it remains to be seen whether these provisions will be sufficient to control spending in future decades.\n\nThe newly insured population is expected to be younger and healthier than the currently insured, and they are expected to drive up the demand for prescription drugs and doctors. This could be a positive sign for reducing spending in the long term, as patients who regularly visit the doctor and practice preventative medicine can avoid more expensive health problems in the future.",
    " Title: Understanding the Iran Nuclear Negotiations: The Role of Sanctions and Domestic Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the third round of talks on the Iranian nuclear program begins in Geneva, it is crucial for the United States to approach the negotiation table with caution. The danger lies in misinterpreting Iran's entry into negotiations as a result of economic pressure due to sanctions and the country's increasing economic and political vulnerability.\n\nHowever, this narrative overlooks the internal politics of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the election of President Hassan Rouhani, who is navigating a delicate political balancing act on the domestic political scene. While sanctions played a role in changing Iran's behavior, they did not force Iran to return to the negotiation table out of fear of economic collapse. Instead, sanctions facilitated a transformation of the balance of power within the Iranian political system that was already underway since 2009, prior to the enactment of the current sanctions regime.\n\nThe election, rather than sanctions, was the key to Iran's shift on foreign policy and nuclear negotiations. The victory of another candidate, such as former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, would not have produced such a change in foreign policy despite the same sanctions regime. The impact of sanctions should be viewed through the lens of electoral turnover and the domestic shifts of power that brought Rouhani to office.\n\nThe current realignment of forces in Iran and the country's intention to engage with the international community presents the U.S. with a significant opportunity. The success of the Rouhani administration and his coalition alliance is critical for reaching a mutually beneficial deal on the nuclear program and for advancing a more moderate and politically inclusive Iran.\n\nHowever, the persistence of sanctions without any meaningful relief or significant incentives can undermine the Rouhani administration and hinder the potential for a resolution. Not only will continued sanctions contribute to the mistrust between the U.S. and Iran, but they will strengthen the hand of Iranian hardliners. A recalibration of political forces back toward the hardline elite would divide the cross-factional coalition supporting the Rouhani presidency.\n\nIn negotiating over the nuclear program with Iran, it is essential that the U.S. and its partners get the sanctions narrative right. While sanctions contributed to an ongoing re-alignment of political factions conducive to Rouhani's electoral victory and the shift in Iranian foreign policy, they alone did not bring Iran to the negotiating table. And their continuance can also undermine the new government that is now in power.\n\nGiven the opportune environment to reach a negotiated deal with Iran, the U.S. would be best served to devise a meaningful incentives package with an eye on the domestic Iranian political scene rather than increasing sanctions on Iran.\n\nPayam Mohseni, a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Government at Harvard University and a postdoctoral research fellow in the International Security Program at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, made these observations.",
    " Title: Senate Shutdown Showdown: Trump's Negotiations and the Government Funding Impasse\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing government funding impasse is centered on the Senate side, with the Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, and Republican leader Mitch McConnell, as key figures in the negotiations. The current proposal is a one-year \"continuing resolution\" (C.R.) that temporarily funds parts of the government at their current levels.\n\nSome Hill Republicans suggested that President Trump should push for a shorter, two-week C.R., delaying the funding battle until early January, allowing Republicans to potentially shift some of the blame onto the incoming Democratic House majority. However, the president reportedly did not favor this option.\n\nEarly this week, the White House signaled that the president was not in an accommodating mood, with hard-liner Stephen Miller appearing on \"Face the Nation\" to state that a shutdown was \"absolutely\" on the table without wall funding. President Trump also tweeted that a wall was essential for \"good Border Security.\"\n\nBy Tuesday, the president had reversed course, seeking a way out of the impasse without appearing to cave. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that he would be open to a bipartisan compromise, which included $1.6 billion for fortifying existing barriers, with the remaining $5 billion potentially siphoned from other agencies. This proposal prompted immediate pushback from Democrats.\n\nSenate appropriators had previously agreed on a spending plan that contained an extra $1 billion for what Democrats deemed an immigration \"slush fund.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered a spending plan containing this additional funding, but Schumer and Pelosi rejected it.\n\nLawmakers from both parties suggest that a continuing resolution is still the most likely way forward. However, the specifics of what the president would agree to remain unclear, with Press Secretary Sanders providing no clarity at a Tuesday afternoon press briefing.\n\nRegardless of his plan, it appears that the president is seeking to extract maximum drama from this government funding standoff. These standoffs align with his belief that negotiations and life are a constant battle of wills. He thrives on making the other side blink and is eager to signal his willingness to take drastic measures to get his way, even if he ultimately capitulates.\n\nShutdown showdowns provide fertile ground for President Trump, as they pit him against a political establishment that, as he sees it, obstinately refuses to pay proper deference to his leadership. He has repeatedly expressed frustration with Congress' unwillingness to defer to his decisions. Threatening to cause chaos, such as furloughing or withholding paychecks from hundreds of thousands of workers, allows him to exact a cathartic form of retribution, reminding lawmakers of his ability to make their lives uncomfortable.",
    " Title: Clinton Campaign Aims to Maintain Momentum Amidst FBI Email Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final week of the U.S. presidential race, Hillary Clinton's campaign is focusing on maintaining its momentum, emphasizing the extensive ground game and get-out-the-vote efforts that have been established over the past 18 months. The sudden revival of Clinton's private email server as a campaign issue, following an announcement by FBI Director James Comey regarding newly discovered emails potentially pertinent to the probe, is being viewed as a test of the campaign's infrastructure and message.\n\nClinton, while campaigning in Kent, Ohio, on Monday, downplayed the investigation, stating that most voters have already made up their minds on the email issue. She emphasized that the focus should be on choosing the next president and commander-in-chief of the United States.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has built a robust ground game across battleground states, dedicating significant time and resources to early voting and Get Out the Vote campaigns. Notable celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Katy Perry, and Jay-Z have been enlisted to aid these efforts.\n\nEarly voting data show that over 3.5 million people have already voted in Florida, making up nearly one-quarter of all registered voters in the state, with Democrats outpacing 2012 vote-by-mail numbers. In Nevada, where nearly one-quarter of registered voters have already cast their ballot, Democrats are outpacing Republicans by nearly 30,000. Clinton aides attribute this early voter turnout, particularly among Hispanic voters, as evidence of the campaign's ground game success.\n\nHowever, the campaign is monitoring any potential damage from Comey's announcement. In some swing states, aides acknowledge that the FBI's renewed probe has created some volatility with voters. There is anecdotal evidence of Clinton volunteers fielding questions about the FBI's investigation while door-knocking over the weekend. On the flip side, the campaign has also seen evidence of Democrats who are now more eager to vote for Clinton as a way to rebuke the FBI.\n\nSince Friday, Clinton and her aides have maintained that Comey's action is unprecedented this close to an election and that there is nothing new to be discovered. Clinton has repeatedly stated that while she regrets using a private server, the FBI simply has \"no case.\"\n\nThe campaign is also pressing Comey, with top campaign officials criticizing his decision not to publicly comment on the Trump campaign's potential ties to alleged efforts by Russia to meddle with the U.S. election. Trump, in contrast, has been lauding Comey and his announcement.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Clinton has relentlessly attacked Trump's temperament and readiness to be president, a strategy that has been in place since Trump became the GOP nominee. In the final days before the election, Clinton aides are confident that voters have had ample time to digest the contrasting choices presented in the election.",
    " Title: Trump Rallies Supporters in Pennsylvania, Mocks Impeachment Process as \"Impeachment Lite\"\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump addressed a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, mocking the ongoing impeachment inquiry as \"impeachment lite\" and asserting that the process has boosted his approval ratings. The visit followed a significant day at the U.S. Capitol, where House Democrats unveiled articles of impeachment and signaled their support for the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA).\n\nTrump's comments came less than a week after an early departure from a NATO meeting in London following the release of a video depicting world leaders gossiping about him. In 2016, Trump won Pennsylvania, the first Republican presidential candidate to do so since 1988, by garnering support in rural areas and among working-class whites. The state, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, is expected to be a key battleground in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHouse Democrats unveiled two articles of impeachment on Tuesday: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. They allege that Trump put U.S. elections and national security at risk by asking Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination. They also claim Trump impeded Congress' investigation into the matter.\n\nIf the House votes to impeach Trump, the case moves to the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is required for conviction. With Republicans holding 53 of 100 seats, it is unlikely that Republican senators would cross party lines and vote to remove Trump from office.\n\nDuring the rally, Trump also addressed the long-awaited release of the Justice Department report into the 2016 Russia investigation. The inspector general found that the FBI was justified in opening its investigation into ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, and that the FBI did not act with political bias, despite \"serious performance failures\" up the bureau's chain of command.\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that the inspector general's report detailed \"outrageous, scandalous, and unprecedented abuses of power.\" He also called FBI agents \"scum\" and said they had \"destroyed the lives of people that are great people.\" Trump also mentioned his anticipation for a report from John Durham, the prosecutor whom Attorney General William Barr has selected to investigate how intelligence was gathered in the Russia probe.\n\nTrump stated, \"A regular president would be under the table, thumb in mouth, saying: 'Take me home, Mommy. This is enough for me.'\"",
    " Title: Breitbart's Traffic Decline: A Comparative Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, right-wing news outlet Breitbart News, with Steve Bannon as its White House chief strategist, was poised for significant growth, aiming to become a media powerhouse with unparalleled access and a passionate audience. In January 2017, Breitbart boasted of its impressive web traffic, ranking as the 45th most visited site in the United States, surpassing Fox News, Huffington Post, Washington Post, and Buzzfeed, according to Alexa.com.\n\nHowever, recent data suggests a different story. As of May 26, 2017, Breitbart's rank has dropped significantly, with Fox News, Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, and Washington Post all outperforming it. According to Alexa.com, Fox News is the 64th most-trafficked site in the country, while Huffington Post is at 60, Buzzfeed is at 50, and The Washington Post is at 41.\n\nComparative analysis of Breitbart's global rankings against other news sites it has compared itself to, such as Fox News and Buzzfeed, shows an unusually steep decline in traffic. ComScore estimated that Breitbart had nearly 23 million unique visitors during the month of November 2016, but only drew 10.7 million in April 2017, a 53% drop. Last month, the site had fewer visitors than it did in April 2016, when 12.3 million people visited the site.\n\nThe decline in Breitbart's traffic is not unique to the right-wing media landscape. Other conservative media sites, such as National Review Online, Infowars.com, The Daily Caller, and Drudge Report, have also experienced traffic slumps. Notably, over the last week, as President Trump was engulfed in the Comey scandal, Fox News's viewership dropped to third place behind CNN and MSNBC for the first time in 17 years.\n\nThe decline in Breitbart's traffic, as measured by Alexa, is peculiar, with a graph that shows a high plateau followed by a precipitous drop around April 30, Trump's 100-day mark. An Alexa customer representative suggested that this could be due to Breitbart enabling, then disabling, Alexa's certified-results feature, which temporarily created an apples-to-oranges comparison with sites that don't enable the feature, like The Washington Post.\n\nIn conclusion, while other conservative media sites have experienced declines in traffic in recent months, Breitbart's decline appears to be more pronounced. The reasons for this decline are not entirely clear, but it is evident that Breitbart's web traffic has significantly decreased since its post-election high.",
    " Title: Vice President's Office Disputes Interpretation of Trump Administration's Immigrant Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe office of Vice President Mike Pence has disputed a characterization of comments made by Marc Short, the Vice President's chief of staff, regarding President Donald Trump's tweets criticizing four Democratic congresswomen of color. In an email to a journalist, Darin Miller, the deputy press secretary for Vice President Pence, argued that the journalist had misconstrued Short's comments about Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Representative Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.).\n\nMiller's email, sent after the publication of a roundup of responses to President Trump's tweets, stated that Short's comments were not intended to compare Chao and Omar's immigration stories, but rather to highlight Chao's story as an example of what the President supports: a legal immigrant who worked hard, assimilated, and is dedicated to giving back and serving her country.\n\nHowever, the email also stated that Omar, unlike Chao, seems content to criticize America at every turn, instead of trying to fix problems she sees. This contrast was drawn by Omar's opposition to the overwhelmingly bipartisan emergency border aid bill, which provided humanitarian aid for asylum seekers.\n\nThe truth is there isn't a meaningful difference between Chao and Omar's immigration stories. Both immigrated legally to the country and now serve in the federal government, albeit with different agendas. As of Wednesday, the saga of Trump's racist tweets is continuing to play out in Congress.",
    " Title: Cruz Campaign Leverages Santa Claus at Minnesota Rally to Collect Voter Data\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unique twist during the first night of Senator Ted Cruz's seven-day, 12-city tour, a Santa Claus made an appearance at a reception hall in Minnesota. The campaign, known for its data-driven approach, used the Santa to collect voter information from attendees.\n\nVisitors were greeted by the Santa, who posed for photos with children and adults. To retrieve these photos, visitors were handed cards directing them to Mr. Cruz's website, where they were asked to provide their names, email addresses, and ZIP codes.\n\nJeff Roe, Mr. Cruz's campaign manager, explained the campaign's strategy, stating, \"The Santa's optically good anyway. It's a Christmas tour, it makes total sense. But you still have to run a campaign when these are over. You can't just come out and do rallies and have nothing left when you leave except for a bunch of uneaten cookies. Now we're going to have living data of people. They'll have an experience they'll remember forever.\"\n\nThe campaign had been brainstorming ways to connect with supporters since an August swing through several southern states. About 19,000 people attended 13 rallies during that trip, but the campaign was disappointed not to collect more information from them. Past efforts to amass voter data through photography had been too complicated and time-consuming, according to Mr. Roe.\n\nThe Santa at the event was Red Bartholomew, a 64-year-old supporter with past performances at Tea Party events, fund-raisers, and church functions. Mr. Bartholomew was contacted by the campaign through his work with \"constitutional-minded people,\" noting that he was a member of Overpasses for America, a group that flies flags and posts signs along pedestrian overpasses.\n\nMr. Bartholomew, who is also known as \"Liberty Claus,\" seemed to have found a kindred spirit in Mr. Cruz. In an interview, he summarized his worldview, described an alternative character he has portrayed, and lamented the burdensome Santa industry regulations that had in the past hamstrung his work.\n\nAttendees at the rally seemed broadly grateful for the Santa's presence, though some snapped photos on their phones and left before receiving a \"photo number\" and a card directing them to the campaign's website. Mary Kay Storhaug, a 45-year-old attendee from Andover, Minnesota, said Mr. Bartholomew provided a welcome distraction for her children during the rally.\n\nMr. Roe stated that the photos were part of building \"a lasting relationship\" with voters, particularly in states like Minnesota that often receive little attention from candidates until just before voting begins. \"When they do engage with a presidential campaign,\" Mr. Roe said, \"I want it to be a meaningful engagement that lasts for hopefully their whole life and our whole life.\"\n\nAt least one attendee seemed wary of letting his information reach the wrong hands. Mr. Bartholomew, when asked to provide a phone number where he could be reached, said he would not answer his landline unless a caller left a message. \"I have to screen my calls,\" he said, \"for a lot of different reasons.\"",
    " Title: Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson's Evolution in the Political Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2010, George Will, a renowned political commentator, described Wisconsin businessman Ron Johnson as the embodiment of the Tea Party movement. Johnson, a manufacturer of plastic products from Oshkosh, was a political neophyte who rose to political prominence through Tea Party rallies across Wisconsin, driven by his opposition to Obamacare.\n\nAt a Madison Tea Party rally, Johnson expressed his support for conservative values, stating, \"We need to elect true conservatives, not politicians but citizen legislators, people who actually listen to us. People who will tell the truth and in the end will do what actually needs to be done.\"\n\nJohnson, a self-proclaimed social conservative, is known for his admiration for the famous atheist Ayn Rand. He has criticized Obamacare as the \"greatest assault on freedom in my lifetime.\" In a video interview for the Ayn Rand Institute, he expressed concern over what he perceived as American suffering from Stockholm syndrome.\n\nHowever, Johnson's definition of freedom primarily revolves around economic issues. His stance on government overreach in non-economic matters is minimal, aligning him more with traditional conservatives than libertarian-leaning figures like Rand Paul.\n\nRecently, Johnson criticized the Tea Party movement at the Republican Leadership Conference, stating, \"You can be very doctrinaire, you can demand purity, but in the end if you want to advance policy that you want enacted, you have to win elections.\" He acknowledged the influence of Tea Party groups but emphasized the importance of winning elections to enact desired policies.\n\nJohnson's comments about \"groups\" leading the Tea Party astray have been interpreted as a reference to organizations like Americans for Prosperity, a Tea Party group closely associated with the Koch brothers. Reports suggest that Johnson remains close to the Koch brothers and is often referred to as their \"model senator.\"\n\nThe truth is that there is ample GOP Big Donor money to go around, making it a non-zero-sum game. However, it appears that Johnson, the Tea Party's favored senator, may be tasked with maintaining control over the Tea Party grassroots and reassuring major donors.\n\nThe future of Johnson's political career remains uncertain, with some questioning his ability to navigate the complexities of Washington politics. However, as a Tea Party favorite and a self-proclaimed capitalist hero, he may be the best the movement has to offer at this time.",
    " Title: Sequester Impasse: Neither Side Willing to Budge as Americans Feel the Cuts Remain Uncertain\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing sequester, a series of $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts, remains unresolved as both President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans show no signs of compromise. The sequester, designed in 2011 to be so severe that it would discourage its implementation, has become a point of contention between the two parties.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) admitted in a recent interview that the full impact of the sequester is not fully understood. Republicans have accepted sequestration as the only guaranteed method to reduce government spending, and there is speculation that the actual impact may not be as severe as anticipated.\n\nCongress could potentially pass legislation to mitigate the impact of the sequester, such as granting department heads the ability to target the cuts more precisely. A Republican-sponsored bill aimed at this goal failed in the Senate last week, but a Senate Democratic leadership aide suggested that the bill could be rewritten to attract Democratic support, particularly from representatives of military states who would be concerned about the impact on their constituents. House Republicans are also planning to vote on a bill that aims to make the budget cuts more manageable for the military and veterans.\n\nHowever, administration officials argue that even added flexibility would not significantly alter the overall impact of the sequester. White House economics adviser Gene Sperling stated that the harsh spending cuts over a short period would still result in a loss of 750,000 jobs, as projected by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nIf the sequester remains in place until the end of the fiscal year in September, it would mark a temporary pause in the emergency budget wars that have dominated Washington since Republicans took control of the House in 2011. The debt limit would not need to be raised until May at the earliest, and it could potentially stretch until August, according to calculations by top-level aides. The prevailing wisdom in the Capitol is that House Republicans cannot demand concessions in exchange for extending the country's borrowing authority, as they lost that right when they agreed to lift the ceiling in January without insisting on an equal amount of cuts.",
    " Title: Donald Trump and Jeb Bush Tied in Reuters-Ipsos Poll for 2016 Republican Presidential Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent Reuters-Ipsos poll released on Saturday, real estate developer and 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has tied with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush for the lead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. The poll, conducted online among self-identified Republicans, showed Trump with the support of 15.8 percent of respondents, compared to 16.1 percent for Bush.\n\nThe poll also showed New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in third place with 9.5 percent, followed by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul with 8.1 percent, surgeon and author Ben Carson with 7.2 percent, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker with 5.8 percent.\n\nHowever, when respondents were given a choice of three candidates - Bush, Trump, or Florida Senator Marco Rubio - Bush had a comfortable lead at 42 percent, compared to 28.4 percent for Trump and 20 percent for Rubio.\n\nIn the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remained in front with the support of 48.3 percent of self-identified Democrats polled, with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders continuing to inch up, at 22.9 percent, and Vice President Joe Biden, who has not entered the race, at 10.7 percent.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Trump's immigration comments has dominated news coverage of the Republican campaign in recent weeks, with numerous businesses, including NBC Universal, Univision, Macy's, Serta, and NASCAR, cutting ties with Trump since he accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals into the United States in his June 16 speech announcing his candidacy. Trump also stated in a July 6 speech that illegal border-crossers from Mexico are carrying \"tremendous infectious disease.\"\n\nThe poll showed Trump's support climbing in the wake of the immigration controversy, with the poll on June 30 showing Bush at 16.9 percent and Trump at 12.8 percent. A hard line against illegal immigration may find a receptive audience in Republican primary voters, with U.S. conservatives often accusing President Barack Obama of doing too little to secure America's border with Mexico.\n\nTrump has also come under fire from some of his Republican rivals, including Bush, who has accused Trump of making \"ugly comments\" that are not reflective of the Republican Party. \"Everybody has a belief that we should control our borders,\" Bush said last week. \"But to make these extraordinarily kind of ugly comments is not reflective of the Republican Party. Trump is wrong on this.\"\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll of the Republican race was conducted among 404 self-identified Republicans age 18 or over from July 6-10, with a credibility interval of 5.7 percentage points.

It argues that trade wars are not beneficial and are not easy to win, citing potential job losses, business failures, and increased rates of mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and suicide.\n\nThe article mentions that the past few recessions in the United States have led to \"jobless recoveries,\" where the labor market struggles for years even after GDP starts growing. This is attributed to companies using recessions to adopt \"labor-saving\" technology, which could lead to job losses in low-skill, routine-based jobs.\n\nThe article also highlights the potential concentration of pain from long-term unemployment among the poorest workers, which could undo the recent progress in wage growth for the poor. The deplorable treatment of migrants at border facilities is also mentioned as a moral stain on the Trump administration, and the article suggests that a global downturn could worsen the living conditions of Central American workers, who are the largest trading partners of the region.",
    " Title: Beto O'Rourke Releases 10 Years of Tax Returns, Reports $370,412 Income in 2017\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Texas Representative Beto O'Rourke has joined the growing list of 2020 presidential candidates releasing their tax returns. O'Rourke and his wife, Amy Sanders O'Rourke, who filed joint returns for 2008 through 2017, reported a total income of $370,412 in 2017, the latest year reported.\n\nThe couple's largest annual income in the 10-year period was $496,280 in 2009, when they reported a $272,775 gain from an investment partnership. Their lowest reported income in the 10-year period was $163,539 in 2012, the year after O'Rourke left the El Paso City Council, and just before he took his seat as a United States congressman in January 2013.\n\nIn 2017, the O'Rourkes reported selling Stanton Street Technology, the El Paso Internet web design firm started by Beto O'Rourke about 20 years ago, for $300,000, making a net gain of $195,627 after costs. However, they ended up losing $3,000 after all capital gains and losses were calculated for that year, according to their income tax return.\n\nO'Rourke earned $162,211 for serving in Congress in 2017, according to his tax return. His wife, who works for the Council on Regional Economic Expansion and Educational Development (CREEED), an El Paso business leaders group aimed at improving education levels in the El Paso area, reported $53,364 in income. She is the group's Choose to Excel director, according to its website.\n\nThe O'Rourkes paid $81,019 in federal income tax in 2017. They paid $88,798 in 2009, when they had their largest reported income. Other Democratic presidential candidates have released their tax returns, including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and California Senator Kamala Harris.\n\nSanders' 2018 return showed he and his wife, Jane, earned more than $550,000, including $133,000 in income from his Senate salary and $391,000 in sales of his book, \"Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In,\" according to the Associated Press. He made more than $1 million in 2017 from his U.S. Senate salary and sales and royalties from his books.\n\nHarris' 2018 returns showed she and her husband had an adjusted gross joint income of about $1.9 million last year, The AP reported. The O'Rourkes plan to release their 2018 tax return \"as soon as possible after they are filed,\" according to a campaign news release. This follows his commitment to increasing accountability and transparency, the campaign reported.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Releases 400 Pages of Trump University \"Playbooks,\" Detailing Sales Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal judge has made public more than 400 pages of documents from Trump University, detailing the sales tactics used to sell high-priced real estate courses. The documents, which are central to a class-action lawsuit against Trump University in California, were released by US district court judge Gonzalo Curiel on Tuesday.\n\nThe documents describe how Trump University staff were instructed to target prospective students' financial weaknesses to encourage them to sign up for a $34,995 Gold Elite three-day package. The courses are now subject to legal proceedings from unhappy clients.\n\nThe documents contain an undated \"personal message\" from Donald Trump to new enrollees at the school: \"Only doers get rich. I know that in these three packed days, you will learn everything to make a million dollars within the next 12 months.\"\n\nThe documents were released despite repeated public attacks from Trump, who had fought to keep the details secret. Judge Curiel ruled that the documents were in the public interest now that Trump is \"the front-runner in the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race, and has placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue.\"\n\nTrump hit back, calling Curiel a \"hater,\" a \"total disgrace,\" and \"biased.\" \"I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. He's a hater,\" Trump said at a rally near the courthouse in San Diego. \"His name is Gonzalo Curiel. And he is not doing the right thing...[He] happens to be, we believe, Mexican.\"\n\nCuriel, who is Hispanic, is American and was born in Indiana. Trump went on to attack Curiel further on Twitter on Monday and at a press conference in New York on Monday.\n\nThe playbook contains long sections telling Trump U team members how to identify buyers and push them to sign up for the most expensive package, and to put the cost on their credit cards. \"If they can afford the gold elite, don't allow them to think about doing anything besides the gold elite,\" the document states.\n\nIf potential students hesitate, teachers are told to read a script encouraging them to be honest with themselves and fix their broken financial plans. Trump University staff are instructed in how to persuade students to put the cost of the course on their credit cards, even if they have just battled to pay off debts.\n\nThe documents also reveal that Trump University staff were told to spend lunch breaks in sign-up seminars \"planting seeds\" in potential students' minds about how their lives won't improve unless they join the program. They are also told to ask students personal questions to discover weaknesses that could be exploited to help seal the deal.\n\nNew York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who has also sued Trump University, renewed his attacks on Trump on Tuesday. \"You are not allowed to protect the trade secrets of a three-card Monte game,\" Schneiderman said ahead of the document's release. \"If you look at the facts of this case, this shows someone who was absolutely shameless in his willingness to lie to people, to say whatever it took to induce them into his phony seminars.\"",
    " Title: Presidential Debate: Obama and Romney Clash in Final Showdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final presidential debate of the 2012 election cycle, President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, engaged in a more subdued and less confrontational exchange than their previous encounter, held in Boca Raton, Florida. The debate, the last before a two-week sprint of campaigning, focused primarily on foreign policy, with the candidates' differences on display despite the less contentious setting.\n\nRomney accused Obama of overseeing a decline in American influence, citing Iran as an example of emboldened enemies. Obama, in response, characterized Romney as \"all over the map\" on foreign affairs, alleging that the Republican nominee's foreign policy proposals were either incorrect or similar to the president's own policies, but with a louder approach.\n\nRomney, who has seen a surge in national and battleground polls after trailing Obama for much of the campaign, at times seemed to reprimand Obama for being too aggressive. In one instance, when Obama pointedly stated that Romney had been wrong every time he offered an opinion, Romney responded, \"Attacking me is not an agenda.\"\n\nBoth candidates found areas of agreement, including ruling out military action in Syria, continuing to support sanctions against Iran, and supporting the withdrawal timetable in Afghanistan. Romney rejected Obama's suggestion that he would revert to the foreign policies of the previous administration, and he also dismissed Obama's claims that Romney would be eager to engage in war with countries like Iran.\n\nRomney's main criticism of Obama was that he had not provided a clear example of American leadership on the world stage, whether in Syria, Iran, or Russia. Obama, in turn, sought to portray Romney as unsteady and out of his depth on foreign policy matters. The president employed sharp, at times sarcastic, language to cast Romney as inexperienced.\n\nThe debate touched on the Libya terror attacks only briefly, with Romney criticizing Obama's response to the Benghazi incident and Obama accusing Romney of focusing on the wrong geopolitical threats. The candidates also sparred over Al Qaeda, with Obama reminding Romney of his previous statements downplaying the threat of Al Qaeda, and Romney asserting that Al Qaeda remained an enormous threat despite Obama's claims that the terror group was on the path to defeat.\n\nOn the issue of Iran, both candidates insisted that, under their administration, Iran would not obtain a nuclear weapon, and that the U.S. would stand by Israel if it were attacked. Romney, however, accused Obama of wasting four years while Iran moved closer to nuclear weapon capability, while Obama defended his efforts to unite the international community against Iran.\n\nThe 90-minute debate at Lynn University, moderated by CBS News' Bob Schieffer, offered the last opportunity for either candidate to significantly impact the race before Election Day. The debates this month have been among the most consequential in modern campaign history, with Romney entering the debates as the slight underdog in most polls but surging since his opening performance. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll on Sunday showed the president and Romney tied at 47 percent nationally, while a Suffolk University survey released Monday showed the two tied at 47 percent in the crucial swing state of Ohio. Other recent polls have given Obama a slight edge.",
    " Title: President Obama's Economy: Net Job Creator According to New Data\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, data released on Thursday indicates that President Obama may now be a net job creator. Following his inauguration in 2009, the U.S. economy experienced a job loss of approximately 4.3 million. However, new figures show that 4.4 million jobs have been added back since then.\n\nSince early 2010, jobs have gradually returned, particularly in professional services, health care, and manufacturing. As of August, the Labor Department had indicated about 4 million jobs had been recovered overall. These figures are subject to frequent revision as the Labor Department receives more complete data over time.\n\nOn Thursday, the Labor Department revised the numbers again, using unemployment insurance records that employers are required to file. Based on this data, the government now believes it under-counted jobs created in much of 2011 by around 386,000. These preliminary figures could still be slightly adjusted in February.\n\nIf accurate, these figures mean the economy has recovered 4.4 million jobs since early 2010, enough to fully account for the jobs lost during Obama's first term. In fact, Obama would be ahead by exactly 125,000 jobs.\n\nPresident Obama is unlikely to boast about this on the campaign trail. In a blog post on Thursday, his top economic adviser, Alan Krueger, stated, \"The jobs recovery over the last 2.5 years has been a bit stronger than initially reported, although much work remains to be done to return to full employment.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, still has ample material to criticize Obama on economic issues. \"President Obama's administration promised, with the passage of the stimulus, that unemployment would currently be at 5.4% with 9 million more people working,\" said Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul, referring to a 2009 report by Obama's then chief economic adviser, Christina Romer.\n\n\"With unemployment at 8% or higher for the 43rd consecutive month and 23 million Americans struggling for work, President Obama's policies have failed miserably by his own standards,\" Saul added. It is important to note that the jobs decline started before Obama entered office, and employment is still far below 2007 levels.\n\nHiring has barely kept pace with population growth, and that's why the unemployment rate is still stuck at 8.1%. A survey of households shows the U.S. population has grown 3.8% since Obama entered office, but jobs have only grown by 1.5% over the same time period. About 12.5 million Americans were still counted as unemployed in August.",
    " Title: Former Obama Administration Officials Criticize Trump's Decision to Withdraw from Iran Nuclear Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to President Trump's announcement of the United States' withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), former Obama administration officials have expressed criticism and concern.\n\nFormer United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power tweeted, \"I will never forget the dark cloud that hung over the White House in the years Iran was advancing nuclear program & Obama was briefed on all the risks of using military force. Trump has demolished America's credibility & paved the way for Iran to re-start its nuclear program.\"\n\nBen Rhodes, a former Obama national security aide and amateur-turned-professional fiction writer, tweeted, \"One tragicomic element of Trump's presidency is that the more he tries to tear down Obama's legacy, the bigger he makes Obama look.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry, who has been traveling the world in an attempt to conduct his own personal foreign policy on behalf of the Iranian government, stated, \"Today's announcement weakens our security, breaks America's word, isolates us from our European allies, puts Israel at greater risk, empowers Iran's hardliners, and reduces our global leverage to address Tehran's misbehavior.\"\n\nPresident Obama himself stated, \"Walking away from the JCPOA turns our back on America's closest allies.\"\n\nIn response to these statements, it is important to note that Iran has been actively involved in terrorism in Yemen and Syria, sponsoring the takeover of Lebanon by the terrorist group Hezbollah, funding the Palestinian terror group Hamas, and developing long-range ballistic missiles while leading chants saying \"Death to America.\" The Middle East has been a region of conflict and instability during Obama's presidency, and the situation has not improved significantly since then.\n\nIt is also important to clarify that the Iranian government is currently led by hardliners, and the JCPOA did not alleviate the possibility of an Iranian nuclear program, as some have suggested. The deal explicitly paved the way for an Iranian nuclear program free and clear of consequences from the international order. Furthermore, the Middle East allies opposed the deal and are celebrating its end.\n\nIn conclusion, the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has sparked criticism from former Obama administration officials, who have expressed concern about the potential consequences of the decision. However, it is important to consider the context and the actions of the Iranian government in the Middle East, as well as the fact that the deal did not alleviate the possibility of an Iranian nuclear program or improve the situation in the Middle East.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders' Proposal to Allow Convicted Felons to Vote While Incarcerated Sparks Controversy Among Democratic Presidential Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has endorsed the idea of allowing convicted felons to vote while they are still in prison. This stance has sparked a debate among the Democratic candidates, with some expressing support, while others have rejected the idea.\n\nDuring a CNN town hall event, Sanders argued that this stance is a matter of voting rights, implying that opposing the idea could be seen as an endorsement of GOP-backed voter suppression efforts. However, his proposal has been met with criticism from some of his fellow candidates.\n\nFor instance, Pete Buttigieg flatly rejected the notion, earning strong applause from the Democratic audience. Kamala Harris, on the other hand, initially expressed openness to the idea but later walked it back after realizing the potential backlash.\n\nThe idea of allowing incarcerated individuals to vote has been met with skepticism and criticism from various quarters. Saikat Chakrabarti, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, has advocated for the idea, questioning why incarcerated people, who are often the most affected by unjust laws, should not have a say in electing people to change them.\n\nHowever, the argument against this proposal is that the right to vote is a privilege granted to eligible U.S. citizens. As Guy Benson, a political commentator, pointed out, the violent vs. non-violent felon dichotomy is problematic, and treating people convicted of \"unjust\" laws more generously is subjective and unworkable.\n\nThe argument is that the right to vote is a privilege that is forfeited by individuals who commit felonies, as they are, by definition, not law-abiding. Convicted felons are deprived of various rights, including freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, and the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. By committing a crime, they forfeit their ability to vote for lawmakers while serving out their sentences.\n\nWhile some argue for the restoration of felons' voting rights upon release, Sanders' proposal to allow voting from behind bars is seen as a far cry from that. Sanders openly favors the idea that the Boston Marathon bomber should be voting from inside prison walls, as should convicted murderers, rapists, child molesters, and others. This proposal has been criticized as wrong and unpopular, with some suggesting that it could be used as a ready-made attack ad against Sanders in a general election.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposal to allow convicted felons to vote while incarcerated has sparked a heated debate among the Democratic presidential candidates. While some argue that it is a matter of voting rights, others believe that it is a privilege that is forfeited by individuals who commit felonies. The debate is ongoing, and it remains to be seen how this issue will play out in the upcoming elections.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Purchases Illinois Prison for Overcrowding Relief, Not Guantanamo Housing, Officials Say\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has announced its intention to purchase the Thomson Correctional Center, an under-used state prison located 150 miles west of Chicago, Illinois. The move is aimed at alleviating overcrowding in high-security prisons and creating jobs, according to administration officials.\n\nHowever, some Republican lawmakers, including Virginia Rep. Frank Wolf, have expressed concerns that the purchase could potentially facilitate the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to Illinois. Wolf, who chairs a key House subcommittee overseeing the sale, claimed on Tuesday that the Obama administration could still carry out its plan by moving prisoners from another federal prison to Thomson and then using the facility to house Guantanamo detainees.\n\nAdministration officials have denied these claims, insisting that the Thomson Correctional Center will not be used as a new home for Guantanamo inmates. Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin and Gov. Pat Quinn first announced the $165 million purchase. In a statement, Durbin said, \"This historic action will lead to the creation of hundreds of construction jobs and over 1,000 permanent jobs at this federal facility.\"\n\nOpposition to the transfer of prisoners stateside has been met with a fierce backlash among some lawmakers, who worry it would pose a security risk. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., warned his committee would oppose the purchase. Rogers stated, \"The Obama administration has been trying for years to open Thompson prison in order to transfer terrorists from Guantanamo Bay onto U.S. soil.\"\n\nThe Thomson Correctional Center was built in 2001 but was not fully opened due to budget troubles. The Obama administration and the Federal Bureau of Prisons have stated that the purchase is strictly for the purpose of easing overcrowding, not for housing Guantanamo detainees.",
    " Title: Clinton Takes Aim at Trump in National Security Speech, Aims to Appeal to Moderate Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from some expectations, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton delivered a scathing speech on Tuesday, focusing on her national security stance rather than attempting to woo supporters of her rival Bernie Sanders ahead of the California primary. The speech, billed as a national security address, lacked new proposals but was a forceful rebuke of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nClinton, in San Diego, a city with a significant military presence, presented herself as a defender of American values and a steady commander-in-chief who believed in America as an exceptional country. She criticized Trump's views on American strength, quoting him as calling the military a \"disaster\" and referring to the United States as a \"third-world country.\"\n\nClinton was introduced by the spouse of an active duty naval officer and spoke with 20 US flags prominently displayed behind her. Although still fighting a primary, Clinton is clearly making a play for independent and Republican voters concerned about Trump's erratic foreign policy pronouncements, as well as his statements on women, Mexican immigrants, and Muslims.\n\nIn late April, during her speech after her victory in the Pennsylvania primary, Clinton appealed to \"thoughtful\" Republicans, independents, and Democrats to stand together against divisive candidates on the Republican side. Although House speaker Paul Ryan finally endorsed Donald Trump on Thursday after weeks of hesitation, prominent Republicans are not rushing to back the presumptive Republican nominee just yet. At least nine Republican governors, and a number of senators, are steering clear from their party's convention in July.\n\nThere has also been a trickle of lifelong, prominent Republicans who openly say they will vote for a Democrat for the first time in their life in November. Clinton's message on American global leadership may not resonate widely with the GOP base, which is turning more isolationist, but it is finding an audience with many moderates and foreign policy thinkers.\n\nOn Twitter, the hashtag #RepublicansforHillary was trending for a day this week, after an interview on US cable TV with a former Reagan administration official, Doug Elmets, who said that \"four years of Hillary Clinton is better than one day with Donald Trump as president.\" Widely quoted in the US media was retired army colonel Peter Mansoor, a former aide to General David Petraeus during the Iraq war.\n\nMr. Mansoor said he would be voting for Clinton not because he had converted to being a Democrat, but because Trump was dangerous. Elections are not won on Twitter and a handful of Republicans won't tip the balance in November, but the chatter on social media is bringing out voices from the Republican party silent during the raucous days of the Republican primaries and raising questions about a ripple effect.\n\nClinton campaign aides were not willing to discuss their strategy to appeal to moderate Republicans, especially while the Democratic primary is still underway. But they acknowledged there were Republicans, particularly those concerned with foreign policy issues, who could support her.\n\nVin Weber, a Republican strategist and former congressman who supported Jeb Bush in the primaries, said Clinton should enlist Republican advisors. \"If she were campaigning like her husband, she would move to the center, and try to get votes that are not locked up by the Republican Party,\" said Mr. Weber, who said he was still doing some hard thinking about how to vote in November.\n\nDemocratic pollster Stanley Greenberg says a recent poll shows moderate Republicans represent a \"stunning 31% of the GOP base,\" what he describes as the alienated third of the party. \"They are disproportionately college graduates in a white, working-class party, and they are socially liberal,\" said Greenberg.\n\nOn marriage equality, climate change, or abortion rights, those GOP moderates are more in sync with the Democratic party. The poll, conducted in February when all the Republican candidates were still in the race, showed that 10% of Republican moderates would vote for Clinton.\n\nKori Schake, a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution, said Clinton's challenge would be to convince anti-Trump Republicans they actually need to vote for her - not simply refrain from voting for Trump. \"Republican refuseniks are not enough to make a difference,\" she said.\n\nMs. Schake said presenting Trump as dangerous was an effective strategy, but it was also key for Clinton to frame her pitch in economic terms. She had to press home the damage she believed a Trump presidency would cause to the economy - but to do so would require moving decisively to the right of Sanders, and risk alienating many in her own party.\n\n\"I've just come back from Cuba, and I've seen what a Sanders economy looks like,\" said Ms. Schake. Clinton will seek to unify the Democratic party ahead of the convention, but to win those moderates Republicans, she will now need to present herself not just as the candidate of her party's middle but of America's center.",
    " Title: President Obama to Discuss Economic Opportunity and Poverty at Georgetown Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a three-day Catholic-Evangelical leadership summit on poverty, President Barack Obama will discuss his belief that recent high-profile confrontations between police and African Americans are often a result of a lack of economic opportunity. The summit, held at Georgetown University, is a response to a call from Pope Francis to focus on the issue of poverty.\n\nThe President's remarks come after rioting in Baltimore last month in response to the death of a black man who was fatally injured in police custody. In response, President Obama stated that tensions between minority communities and police departments have been simmering for decades in the U.S. He described the situation as a \"slow-rolling crisis\" that has been ongoing for a long time.\n\nWhite House Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Jerry Abramson, who is also the former mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, stated that President Obama will talk at the summit about the need to provide more opportunities for urban children. Abramson noted that in America, too many young people are limited by the ZIP code into which they are born.\n\nSince his first day in office, President Obama has worked to address these issues by rebuilding the economy, protecting civil rights, expanding college access, providing tax credits to working families, and targeting more money to high-poverty neighborhoods.",
    " Title: US, Canada Reach Last-Minute Deal on USMCA, Updating NAFTA\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States and Canada reached a last-minute deal on Sunday night, agreeing to a framework for a revised trilateral trade agreement known as the USMCA, or the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. This new agreement is an updated version of the original North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the three countries.\n\nIn a joint statement issued late Sunday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland announced the \"new, modernized trade agreement\" that will \"result in freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth in our region.\" The statement emphasized that the USMCA will \"strengthen the middle class, and create good, well-paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call North America home.\"\n\nThe breakthrough came after a weeks-long impasse and intense negotiations, particularly between the U.S. and Canada. Last week, the U.S. indicated a willingness to move forward with a bilateral deal between the U.S. and Mexico, potentially leaving Canada out. However, on Friday, the U.S. and Mexico agreed to hold off publishing the bilateral text, allowing for negotiations between the U.S. and Canada to continue over the weekend.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it a \"good day for Canada,\" while President Donald Trump, in a series of tweets on Monday, congratulated both Canada and Mexico, calling the deal a \"great deal for all three countries.\"\n\nSenior Trump administration officials have hailed the USMCA as a significant victory for the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, with one official stating that the deal \"represents fulfillment of one of the president's most important campaign promises.\"\n\nKey components of the deal include increased access for U.S. farmers to Canada's dairy market, the elimination of Canada's Class 7 milk pricing, and the preservation of NAFTA's Chapter 19, an independent panel for resolving special trade disputes, albeit renumbered in the final USMCA agreement. Canada also secured protections from Section 232 tariffs, but did not receive guarantees over steel and aluminum tariffs, which will be addressed separately.\n\nThe USMCA also includes rules of origin for automobiles, new digital trade rules, intellectual property protections, and strengthened labor rules, among other components. The agreement incorporates the components of the bilateral agreement between the U.S. and Mexico.",
    " Title: Strategies for a Potential Republican Presidential Nominee to Win a Majority in the Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the approaching final stretch of the Republican primary season, a potential nominee for the presidency of the United States is advised to implement several strategies to close the gap between their current support and the 50 percent needed to secure a majority. The following are five key recommendations:\n\n1. Moderate tone and language: The nominee should avoid engaging in personal attacks and confrontations, as these tactics may drive away voters needed to reach 50 percent. Instead, the nominee should choose their battles more carefully and present their arguments in a less belittling and pejorative manner.\n\n2. Accurate facts and information: The nominee should support their statements with accurate facts or anecdotes to demonstrate a strong command of the issues and avoid raising doubts about their substantive knowledge.\n\n3. Increase policy knowledge: The nominee should take the time to learn about various issues and demonstrate a level of fluency and expertise in policy discussions. This will help to address concerns that the nominee lacks the necessary knowledge to occupy the Oval Office.\n\n4. Deliver policy announcements: As an outsider with business experience, the nominee should provide specific policy proposals to address various issues, such as energy policy, corporate welfare, agriculture policy, and others. This will help to demonstrate the nominee's ability to govern and grow support among voters.\n\n5. Avoid citing polls: The nominee should refrain from discussing polls, as this can be perceived as self-centered and may harm their image if they start losing contests. Instead, the nominee should focus on the hopes and dreams of the voters and present themselves as a candidate who can lift up the country, defend it, and grow the economy.\n\nThe nominee's success in the primary will depend on their ability to earn a majority, and these strategies are intended to help the nominee achieve that goal. The nominee's best moments demonstrating a more thoughtful approach have been their Super Tuesday news conference at Mar-A-Lago and their policy speech to AIPAC.",
    " Title: Senate's Strategy to Prevent Recess Appointments: Pro-forma Sessions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has expressed his intention to refuse considering any nominee President Obama may submit to fill the vacancy. In response, President Obama may consider a recess appointment as an end-run option. However, the Republican-led Senate can prevent this by scheduling pro-forma sessions every three days, ensuring they are not in recess and thus, blocking a recess appointment.\n\nAccording to the Constitution, the House and Senate must meet every three days unless there is an agreement between the two bodies to skip meetings and go on recess. With the ongoing battle over a Supreme Court pick, it is unlikely that the Senate will agree to recess in the near future.\n\nPro-forma sessions are brief meetings of the House and Senate, lasting only a minute or two, and sometimes even just seconds. During these sessions, the Senate does not conduct any business, and they are often referred to as \"gavel-in, gavel-out.\" No votes are taken, no speeches are made, and few words are uttered at all.\n\nThe House and Senate do not consider themselves adjourned or on recess if they are meeting every three days. This strategy, employed by both parties in the past, effectively blocks a recess appointment for the remainder of the president's term.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, when Democrats still controlled the Senate, Republicans controlled the House. The GOP-controlled House refused to agree to an adjournment resolution to block Obama from scuttling a Senate filibuster of his nominees to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). As a result, the House and Senate met every three days.\n\nIn early 2012, President Obama made four recess appointments in the window between the three-day pro-forma sessions. However, the Supreme Court later voided these appointments, ruling that the Senate was indeed in session and the appointments were made during the three-day sessions.\n\nIn 2003, during the final two years of President George W. Bush's term, the Democrat-controlled Senate met every few days to block Bush from making a recess appointment. In 2003, Senate Republicans criticized minority Democrats for holding up a number of judicial nominations, particularly the nomination of Judge Bill Pryor to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Georgia. Democrats filibustered Pryor, and during a summertime adjournment, Bush appointed Pryor without the Senate's advice and consent.\n\nDemocrats may attempt to force Republicans to take a vote this summer to confirm a nominee, but Republicans can prevent a recess appointment later this year by simply meeting every three days.",

Restaurant Amid Protests Over Supreme Court Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - Senator Ted Cruz was driven out of an upscale restaurant on Monday night by a crowd of protesters chanting \"We believe survivors.\" The incident occurred at Fiola, an Italian restaurant in Washington's Penn Quarter neighborhood.\n\nIn a video posted on social media, a woman approaches Cruz and his wife Heidi as they prepare to sit at their table. She asks Cruz about his vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, as the chant grows louder in the background.\n\n\"Hi. I'd love to talk with you about Brett Kavanaugh tonight,\" the woman says. \"I'm a constituent. Love to know what your vote is going to be tonight. I know that you're very close friends with Mr. Kavanaugh. And do you believe survivors, sir?\"\n\nTwo women, Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, have accused Kavanaugh of past sexual misconduct.

In a second video, more than a dozen people are seen shouting at the couple and recording the incident on their phones as Cruz and his wife try to exit.\n\nCruz politely says \"excuse me\" as he tries to work his way through the chanting crowd and adds, \"God bless you,\" as one protester waves a middle finger in his direction.\n\n\"Excuse me, let my wife through,\" the senator says, turning back toward Heidi Cruz. A few protesters cheer and yell \"bye\" after Cruz and his wife exit the establishment. \"We booted him out,\" one voice exclaims.\n\nA restaurant employee is then heard asking the protesters to \"leave the premises.\"\n\nOne protester asked Cruz, \"Are you going to confirm your best friend, Brett Kavanaugh?\"\n\n\"Beto is way hotter than you, dude,\" another shouted in reference to Cruz's Democratic opponent in his re-election fight, Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\nO'Rourke tweeted Tuesday that Cruz should not have been treated that way.\n\n\"Not right that Senator Cruz and his wife Heidi were surrounded and forced to leave a restaurant last night because of protesters,\" O'Rourke wrote. \"The Cruz family should be treated with respect.\"",
    " Title: UN General Assembly Vote: 128 Countries Call for Reversal of U.S. Jerusalem Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, 128 countries, including some of the United States' most trusted allies, voted in favor of a United Nations resolution on Thursday calling for a reversal of President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Only nine countries voted against the resolution.\n\nThe resolution, while not explicitly referring to the U.S., is clearly directed at the White House. The measure declares that any changes to the status of Jerusalem \"have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded.\" It also \"calls upon all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the Holy City of Jerusalem,\" another shot at the administration, which announced plans to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nThe closest the U.S. got to support from allies was 35 abstentions. Friends of the U.S. like Canada, Mexico, and Australia refrained from voting on the resolution, which means that while they didn't support the U.S. with a vote against it, they didn't criticize the U.S. either with a vote in favor of it.\n\nThursday's vote took place at a rare emergency session of the 193-member UN General Assembly. Turkey and Yemen, on behalf of two international organizations of Arab and Muslim countries, called for the emergency session after the U.S. vetoed a similar resolution at the UN Security Council on Monday. Unlike at the Security Council, the U.S. does not have veto power at the broader General Assembly.\n\nThe administration made a concerted effort to swing countries to its side before the UN vote. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley promised the U.S. would be \"taking names\" of those who voted against the U.S. She also sent a letter to the UN ambassadors of more than 180 member countries warning that any vote in favor of the resolution would be taken \"personally\" by the president himself.\n\nPresident Trump suggested during a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday that he would withhold billions of dollars in aid for countries that voted against the U.S. \"Let them vote against us; we'll save a lot,\" Trump said. \"We don't care.\"\n\nAnd in a speech before the General Assembly right before the vote on Thursday, Haley escalated things even further, threatening to cut off U.S. funding to the UN over the vote.\n\n\"When we make generous contributions to the UN, we also have a legitimate expectation that our goodwill is recognized and respected,\" Haley said. \"When a nation is singled out for attack in this organization, that nation is disrespected.\"\n\n\"We have an obligation to demand more for our investment,\" she said.\n\nBut the pressure campaign didn't work very well. Even close U.S. allies like the U.K. and Egypt were unmoved by America's dark warnings. And the fact that the vote stacked so heavily against the U.S. after an unusually aggressive campaign from the Trump administration against it only exacerbated the optics of isolation.\n\nRichard Gowan, a UN expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told me Haley's abrasive politicking was a bit surprising. \"While diplomats expect Trump to be crude, they may have expected a bit better from Haley. She is normally more pragmatic.\"\n\nThere are even signs that the heavy-handed threats backfired. Barak Ravid, a correspondent for Israel's Channel 10 news, reported that Canada switched from voting against the resolution to abstaining in order to avoid looking like a puppet of the U.S.\n\nThat Haley had to resort to such measures to try to convince even a few countries to side with the U.S. highlights the extraordinary sensitivity surrounding Jerusalem, which has sites holy to Jews, Christians, and Muslims, and which both the Palestinians and the Israelis claim as their capital.\n\nJerusalem has always been polarizing. Now it's even more so. Trump's December 6 speech recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital broke with decades of bipartisan American foreign policy about the city's future. Presidents of both parties have supported the idea of creating an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, with the final status of Jerusalem to be decided as part of a peace agreement between the two sides.\n\nTrump's language during his speech wasn't quite as inflammatory as it could've been. As Sarah Wildman pointed out for \u2588\u2588\u2588 at the time of the announcement, Trump didn't call Jerusalem the undivided capital of Israel\u2014suggesting the U.S. would still support potentially dividing Jerusalem between the Israelis and the Palestinians as part of future peace negotiations.\n\nBut the move\u2014along with the announcement that the U.S. would move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\u2014sparked outcry in the international community and further polarized one of the most contentious territorial disputes in the world.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said on Sunday that he intends to open an embassy in East Jerusalem\u2014the part of the city that Palestinians officially want as the capital of a future Palestinian state. That came days after he convened a gathering of Muslim leaders to call for the world to see East Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian state.\n\nA statement signed by more than 50 Muslim-majority countries at that summit declared that the U.S. had lost its role as a \"sponsor of peace\" in the Middle East. And Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said in a speech last week that Trump's Jerusalem announcement was a \"crime\" and that he no longer wants the U.S. to broker peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nGowan, the UN expert, says that ultimately all the UN theatrics probably won't actually end up hurting the U.S.\n\n\"This is, ironically, a diplomatic win for all concerned,\" he said. \"The vast majority of UN members have shown that they are principled defenders of international law and the Palestinian people. The U.S. has shown that it will go to the wire for Israel, and Trump can boast he is tougher than Obama on the Middle East. And everyone can go home for the holidays with a warm glow.\"",
    " Title: National Donors Influence Wisconsin Sheriff Race: Bloomberg, NRA Back Opposing Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming primary election on Tuesday, voters in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, will decide between controversial Sheriff David Clarke Jr. and police lieutenant Chris Moews. This local race has attracted significant national attention and funding, with gun control groups and the National Rifle Association (NRA) spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the contest.\n\nSheriff Clarke, a proponent of Second Amendment rights, made headlines last year for a radio ad encouraging citizens to enroll in firearms classes following budget cuts. In a 30-second commercial, Clarke urged residents to \"point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger\" because \"911 is not our best option.\"\n\nClarke's primary race opponent, Moews, is backed by substantial financial support aimed at undermining Clarke's campaign. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has publicly committed to spending $50 million on gun-control politics in 2014, has invested $150,000 in a series of television ads targeting Clarke's conservative pro-gun policies. This funding surpasses the combined spending of both Clarke and Moews on their campaigns.\n\nBloomberg's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, told the Wall Street Journal that the decision to get involved in the sheriff's race was made to shape policy on a local level. \"The issue of guns is one that [Bloomberg] cares an awful lot about, and there\u2019s a very clear contrast on that issue in this race,\" Wolfson stated.\n\nThe Greater Wisconsin Committee, an independent expenditure group, has also contributed $400,000 to the race through anti-Clarke advertisements.\n\nClarke, who identifies as a Democrat but often aligns with conservative Republicans, spoke at the NRA's annual meeting in April. The NRA, who considers Clarke a \"rising national star,\" has come to Clarke's defense, soliciting donations from its members and purchasing online ads for his re-election bid.\n\nChris Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, stated, \"Make no mistake: Sheriff Clarke is fighting the reelection battle of his life right now because he dared to stand on principle by standing up for you, me, and the NRA.\"\n\nClarke, in a recent interview with Wisconsin News Radio 620 WTMJ, expressed his support for the right to self-defense, stating, \"If I have the opportunity to defend myself and my family, I will do so to the best of my abilities, but I'm certainly also going to call 911 if I have the ability because I need the cavalry to come and help me.\"\n\nMoews, in the same political event, expressed a different perspective, stating, \"If I have the opportunity to defend myself and my family, I will do so to the best of my abilities, but I'm certainly also going to call 911 if I have the ability because I need the cavalry to come and help me.\"\n\nThe winner of Tuesday's primary will likely become the next county sheriff, as no Republicans are contesting the position. Both candidates are running as Democrats. The winner will move on to the November general election.",
    " Title: Egypt Launches Airstrikes Against Islamic State Targets in Libya in Response to Execution of Egyptian Christians\n\nArticle:\n\nEgypt has reportedly launched airstrikes against Islamic State (IS) targets in the eastern Libyan city of Darna, in retaliation for the gruesome execution of 21 Egyptian Christians shown in a video released on Sunday. The mass murder threatens to open a new front in the ongoing battle against the self-declared Islamic State, potentially drawing Western powers once more into military intervention in Libya.\n\nAccording to Egyptian state television and various news outlets, including the BBC and Reuters, the strikes, made in coordination with the military of the recognized Libyan government based in Tobruk, targeted \"camps, training sites, and weapons storage areas\" of the IS affiliate in Libya. A Libyan air-force commander reportedly stated that 40 to 50 militants were killed in the strike. The Associated Press reports that a second airstrike is currently underway.\n\nThe strikes were in response to an IS video released on Sunday showing the execution of 21 Egyptians, all Coptic Christians, at the hands of masked IS supporters. The video, shot in IS signature style, demonstrates the group's Libyan branch's ability to hold captives for weeks and carry out a highly-produced murder show without fear of intervention from Egypt or any other country.\n\nHowever, Egypt's ability to respond effectively is limited, as the Egyptian military is primarily trained for domestic control and running the business empires of its senior officers. The extent of Egypt's ability to counter the group in Libya, rather than its hundreds of followers in the Egyptian Sinai peninsula, remains to be seen.\n\nThe recognized Libyan government in Tobruk has already called for the US-led coalition attacking IS forces in Syria and Iraq to turn its attention to Libya. Libyan Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni, speaking to Reuters, has requested Western military intervention against IS and Al Qaeda members he claims are present in his country.\n\nReuters notes that the Islamist rival government in Tripoli, a group called Libyan Dawn, denies any affiliation with either IS or Al Qaeda. The New York Times adds that at least three groups among the multitude fighting in Libya's civil war have declared loyalty to IS, \"one in each of the country\u2019s component regions: Barqa in the east, Fezzan in the desert south, and Tripolitania in the west, around the capital.\"\n\nThe Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed provinces have compounded Libya\u2019s instability by introducing the prospect of Islamist-against-Islamist violence between those who support and those who oppose the group. However, Tripolitania has emerged as the province that most clearly threatens Westerners and Western interests. Last month, fighters under the group\u2019s banner claimed responsibility for a brazen attack on a luxury hotel in the capital, Tripoli, that is a hub for visiting Westerners and leaders of the Islamist-backed provisional government.\n\nIn a commentary published in the Daily Telegraph, Shashank Joshi warns that \"it\u2019s important to separate [the IS] role in Libya from the broader civil war there. Not every Libyan opposition faction is jihadist, and acting as if it were, by taking firm sides, is a recipe for disaster.\"",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Strategies: A Reality TV Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nThe presidential campaign of Donald Trump, a former reality TV star, has been marked by a distinct influence from his background in television. While much attention has been focused on his political ascendancy, less emphasis has been placed on the impact of reality television on his campaign strategies.\n\nRobert Thompson, founder of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University in New York, suggests that the Trump campaign has incorporated numerous elements from reality TV, shaping the candidate's approach and, in turn, the broader presidential campaign landscape.\n\nThompson asserts, \"The Trump campaign has used a whole bunch of tricks from reality television to run his campaign and extend control over other people's campaigns.\" He explains that Trump's success can be attributed to the fact that, despite differences between his TV show and the presidential race, he is \"playing by the rules of reality TV, and the people covering him are largely unconsciously playing by the same reality show rules as well.\"\n\nWhile Trump's success can also be attributed to factors such as nativist and populist insurgencies and voter hunger for \"outsiders\" in an era of frustration with Washington elites, prominent features of his candidacy align closely with his chosen television genre. Here are six significant ways in which this is evident:\n\n1. Conflict: Trump's campaign is characterized by frequent confrontations, a common element in reality TV shows.\n2. \"Confession Rooms\": Trump's use of private, off-camera conversations, reminiscent of the \"confession rooms\" in reality TV, allows him to express his thoughts and emotions without the constraints of a public forum.\n3. Soundbites: Trump's concise, attention-grabbing statements, often delivered in a dramatic manner, are a staple of reality TV and have become a defining aspect of his campaign.\n4. Ratings: Trump's campaign has been successful in capturing media attention and generating high ratings, a key metric in the reality TV world.\n5. Sensationalism: Trump's penchant for making bold, attention-grabbing statements, often without providing specifics, is a tactic borrowed from reality TV.\n6. Control: Trump's efforts to control the narrative and shape the media coverage of his campaign, as well as his attempts to influence other candidates' campaigns, reflect the power dynamics often seen in reality TV.\n\nThis analysis offers a unique perspective on the Trump campaign, highlighting the ways in which his reality TV background has influenced his approach to politics. However, it is essential to recognize that this is just one of many lenses through which to view his campaign. Other factors, such as the role of nativist and populist insurgencies, also play significant roles in understanding Trump's success.",
    " Title: Defense Secretary Mattis Earns Title of 'Clarifier' for Trump as He Modifies President's Statements\n\nArticle:\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis, also known as \"Mad Dog\" Mattis, is quickly earning the title of President Trump's clarifier. In Trump's seven-month tenure, Mattis has deftly shifted the tone and message of the president's seemingly never-ending stream of off-the-cuff comments.\n\nOn various topics, including torture, the importance of NATO, the regional conflict between Qatar and neighboring countries, and leadership confidence in Afghanistan, Mattis has altered Trump's words into more diplomatic and less emotional messages, without drawing the ire of the commander-in-chief.\n\nOne source close to the Defense secretary described Mattis as \"the great clarifier.\" \"He's just providing a more detailed clarification to the president's statements,\" the source said. \"He's very methodical in his process.\"\n\nIn his most recent show of savvy, Mattis on Wednesday sought to downplay Trump's assertion that seemed to rule out a diplomatic solution to North Korea's missile tests. Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that the United States \"has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!\"\n\nThe former Marine Corps general, when asked about the tweet later that day, said, \"We're never out of diplomatic solutions.\"\n\nThe source close to Mattis said of the secretary's message delivery, \"I think he expresses in a terminology that he feels fits. He's very methodical in his process.\"\n\nIt's no secret Mattis has remained a favorite of Trump's even as the notoriously unpredictable president has soured on a number of administration officials. \"I think they communicate to each other very openly, very clearly, even warmly,\" the source told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThat open dialogue, which includes frequent working dinners and regular phone calls and meetings, has earned Mattis significant leeway in interpreting Trump's public and Twitter comments. Mattis's savvy became apparent within the first few weeks after Trump's election.\n\nThe retired Marine Corps general, who has long disapproved of using torture to gather intelligence, prompted Trump to change his tune after meeting with him to discuss the Defense secretary position. \"Mattis said that he does not intend to use [torture]. I'm with him all the way,\" Trump later said in an interview on Fox News in January.\n\nThe secretary also opposed Trump's early views that NATO was \"obsolete\" and later placated world leaders after Trump did not reaffirm America's commitment to the military alliance while at an opening ceremony for NATO's new Brussels headquarters in May.\n\n\"To quote a British observer of us from some years back, bear with us,\" Mattis said at the Asian security forum in Singapore when asked about Trump's omission and recent pledge to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. \"Once we have exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing.\"\n\nMore recently, when Trump reportedly sought to fire the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Jon Nicholson, because the United States is \"losing\" the war, Mattis defended the general while not disparaging Trump's view.\n\n\"I will tell you right now, he is our commander in the field, he has the confidence of NATO, he has the confidence of Afghanistan, he has the confidence of the United States,\" Mattis told reporters earlier this month when asked if Trump has confidence in Nicholson. \"The president, again, is looking at all aspects of our effort over there, as he must in his responsibilities as the commander-in-chief.\"\n\nOne source familiar with the situation said Mattis's interpretations are simply \"holding the line until a semblance of normalcy is restored during the tumultuous first year of this administration.\"\n\n\"I believe [Mattis] hopes that once the administration gets its feet under it and learns D.C., that things will get better and move toward the campaign agenda,\" the source said.\n\nMattis also is adept at responding when faced with criticism that he is pushing back on Trump's assertions. He himself called the idea that he contradicted Trump \"ludicrous\" and \"widely misinterpreted.\"\n\n\"I was asked if there were any diplomatic efforts left, and I said of course,\" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday. \"It did not contradict anything the president said. We're not talking to the North Koreans right now.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I can't help people who misinterpret things. I'll do my best to call it like I see it, but right now if I say six and the president says half-a-dozen, they're gonna say I disagree with him.\"\n\nThe secretary did admit that there are issues he and the president disagree on but revealed the division of opinions in a complimentary tone.\n\n\"The first time I met with President Trump, we disagreed on three things in my first 40 minutes with him, on NATO, on torture, and something else, and he hired me. This is not a man who's immune to being persuaded if he thinks you've got an argument,\" Mattis said.\n\nWhen asked about critics who say he and other national security leaders should step down when Trump makes divisive remarks, Mattis pointed to service to the greater good.\n\n\"You know, when a president of the United States asks you to do something, I come\u2014I don't think it's an old-fashioned school at all. I don't think it's old-fashioned or anything. I don't care if it's Republican or Democrat, we all have an obligation to serve. That's all there is to it.\"",
    " Title: Biden Vows to Counter Foreign Interference in U.S. Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has stated that he will take aggressive action against foreign governments interfering in U.S. elections if he is elected president. The statement came hours after Democratic leaders issued a new warning that Congress appears to be the target of a foreign interference campaign.\n\nBiden, in a statement on Monday, said he would treat foreign interference as an \"adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation's government.\" He criticized President Donald Trump for not doing enough in response to U.S. intelligence agencies' assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"If any foreign power recklessly chooses to interfere in our democracy, I will not hesitate to respond as president to impose substantial and lasting costs,\" Biden said.\n\nThe new alarms give a renewed urgency to concerns that foreign actors could be trying to influence the vote or sow disinformation. Biden said last week that he had begun receiving intelligence briefings and warned that Russia, China, and other adversaries were attempting to undermine the presidential election. Biden gave no evidence, but he said that Russia was \"still engaged\" after 2016 and that China was also involved in efforts to sow doubts in the American electoral process.\n\nDuring an online fundraiser on Monday, Biden added, \"It's going to be tough, there's not much I can do about it now except talk about it, and expose it, but it is a serious concern. It is truly a violation of our sovereignty.\"\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC, Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"knows I mean what I say.\"\n\nThe Democratic leaders said in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday that they are concerned that Congress appears to be the target of a \"concerted foreign interference campaign\" to influence the 2020 presidential election. They asked Wray for an all-members, classified briefing on the matter before the August recess.\n\nThe letter from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, and the top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees contains no details about the threats, though they describe them as serious and specific.\n\nWhile the Democrats' exact concerns were unclear, there have been worries since Trump was elected that Russia's efforts to sow American chaos are ongoing in the 2020 election. The 2016 effort included hacking of Democratic email accounts during the campaign by Russian military intelligence officials and the subsequent disclosure by WikiLeaks.\n\nIntelligence authorities said that hack-and-leak operation was aimed at helping Trump's presidential campaign and harming that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Russians also used a covert social media campaign to spread misinformation and posts aimed at dividing American public opinion. In the end, former special counsel Robert Mueller charged 25 Russian nationals for their roles in foreign interference and influence during the campaign.\n\nDemocrats, including members of the Senate intelligence panel, have voiced concerns that an ongoing Republican probe into Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and his work in Ukraine would amplify Russian disinformation. That probe is being led by Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis.\n\nIn a statement, Johnson spokesman Austin Altenburg said the committee's staff had already requested and received a briefing on Russian disinformation, and Johnson had requested an additional briefing at the member level.",
    " Title: New York's Liberal Immigration Policy Affects Family of Undocumented Immigrant Living in Staten Island\n\nArticle:\n\nThe family of Nancy Paredo, a resident of Staten Island, New York, has been living in the United States for 13 years after she allegedly entered the country illegally from Ciudad Juarez. Due to New York's liberal immigration philosophy, Paredo and her family, including her American-born son Axel, are not afraid of being deported every day, but they are cautious and closely monitoring Washington this summer.\n\nAxel, a five-year-old, was born in the United States. His brothers Yan, who is 15, and Demis, 13, were born in Mexico and remain undocumented.\n\nOn June 30, President Obama announced a new effort to address the U.S. immigration system. However, only Congress has the power to grant people like Paredo and her family legal status, and President Obama's options are limited. The focus will be on reducing deportations among people who have been in the country for years.\n\nOne of Obama's easiest options would be to refine a 2010 policy that states undocumented, non-criminal, breadwinning immigrants would not be high deportation priorities. Such a change could ease some of the fears in the family, but immigrant advocates and families say it's unclear whether it would make a significant difference.\n\nA more forceful step from the President could fully eliminate deportation for some immigrants - at least for a time. Yan Carlos Valdez, who is currently applying for protection under a policy known as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), could benefit from such a move. DACA lasts two years and would give him work permits and a social security number. A move from the President could grant DACA-like protections to the parents of United States citizens.\n\nExtending these protections could impact an estimated 3.8 million people. The number would be higher if the President chose to extend protections to the parents of DACA-recipients. However, that's a step that government lawyers say would almost surely invite legal scrutiny and Republican opposition.\n\nPresident Obama's most far-reaching - and controversial - move would be to extend DACA-like protections to all undocumented immigrants who meet a certain criteria. That's an estimated 9.6 million people. Nancy Paredo and her family could be free from deportation fears, but it's another move that would almost surely bring a legal challenge.\n\nParedo and her family often visit Washington to add their voice to the pressure for reform. \"What do you want for your mom and dad?\" Emily asked Axel. \"I want them to be safe,\" Axel replied.",
    " Title: Analysis: The Extreme Pendulum Swing Theory of Presidential Displacement and the 2020 Democratic Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent incident involving former Vice President Joe Biden's interaction with an Iowa farmer has sparked discussions about the qualities needed to beat President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. The Extreme Pendulum Swing Theory of Presidential Displacement suggests that changing the party in power requires a total opposite of the current chief executive, not in policy but in style and attitude.\n\nIn 1980, a feckless and besweatered Jimmy Carter gave way to the robust Ronald Reagan, whose strong and confident approach offered a shot in the arm to a country that had been down on itself for over a decade. In 1992, fuddy-duddy George H.W. Bush lost to the cool and modern Bill Clinton. In 2000, George W. Bush restored \"honor and dignity\" to the White House after eight years of personal scandal and drama, as the nation turned to a moral, conservative family man as it punished Al Gore for Bill Clinton's numerous sins. In 2008, Barack Obama, who formed articulate and complete sentences, shot hoops, hung with celebrities, and sounded like he had all the answers, was elected. In 2016, a nation no longer concerned with experience bought Donald Trump's anti-elite pitch, as he railed against the elitist in the White House and the one opposing him.\n\nAccording to this theory, three 2020 Democratic candidates - Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang - provide enough opposite magic. Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Mike Bloomberg are considered too similar to Trump or lack the necessary contrasting qualities.\n\nPete Buttigieg, a young, Ivy League-educated Navy veteran, offers a contrasting attitude regarding America's place in the world. He enjoys Middle America street cred while espousing big-city liberal values. His biggest similarity to Trump? His confidence and ambition far outstrip his experience.\n\nAmy Klobuchar, another Midwesterner, is a U.S. senator with real-deal political experience. Her deliberate and understated style (at least in public) is the opposite of bombastic. Nominating a woman plays to the gaping gender gap that has opened on Trump's job approval. Her most Trump-like trait could be in the way she treats staff in private, if you believe the stories.\n\nAndrew Yang is a detail-oriented Asian American technocrat who, as he often says, likes math. He's young and has worked in the modern economy as well as the nonprofit sector. He appears to be having fun - how novel! While I find him to be Trump's opposite in almost every way, his one similarity comes in his instinct that impeachment is \"a loser\" for Democrats.\n\nIn conclusion, the Extreme Pendulum Swing Theory of Presidential Displacement suggests that the 2020 Democratic candidates who offer the most opposite magic are Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang. These candidates, while not exactly the '27 Yankees of American politics,' represent a near opposite choice. Democrats often gravitate to and win with \"nerdy wonks,\" according to one Democratic strategist. This theory originally appeared in the Louisville Courier-Journal.",
    " Title: Pakistani High Court Upholds Allowing Marriage of Underage Girls Based on Sharia Law\n\nArticle:\n\nA Pakistani high court has issued a ruling based on Islamic sharia law that permits men in Pakistan to marry girls who have undergone their first menstrual cycle, despite the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, which forbids marriage below the age of 18. The ruling was made during a court hearing regarding the kidnapping, forced conversion, and marriage of Huma Younus, a 14-year-old Christian girl.\n\nAccording to reports, Younus was kidnapped by three men from her home in Karachi last October. The men waited for her parents to leave before forcibly taking the young girl, who was then taken to Dera Gazi Khan, a city in the Punjab province of Pakistan, more than 370 miles from her home. Since then, Younus' parents have been working to recover their daughter.\n\nYounus' parents received documents from the abductors a few days after she was taken, including papers showing her alleged conversion to Islam and a marriage certificate. The girl's mother, Nagina, stated that the papers are fake because the date on the documents was the same as the day when her daughter was abducted.\n\nIn an effort to rescue their daughter, the family argued that the marriage to a man named Jabbar was invalid under the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act. The Christian couple supplied the court with baptismal and school documents proving Huma is 14, according to the International Christian Concern (ICC). She was born on May 22, 2005, the Independent Catholic News reports.\n\nThe law in question was passed almost six years ago in an effort to stop forced marriages to minors in the province. The practice is prevalent among Hindus and Christian girls, according to various media outlets.\n\nDuring the court hearing, judges Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Irshad Ali Shah ruled that the marriage between Huma and Jabbar is valid because she has already had her first period.\n\n\"Once again, justice has been defeated, and, once again, our state has shown itself unable to treat Christians as Pakistani citizens,\" Nagheena Younus, Huma's mother, told Aid to the Church in Need (ACN).\n\nHuma's parents have vowed to take her case to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. \"On February 3rd, we went to the Sindh High Court, but our little girl was not in the courtroom. If we do not get justice, we will address the case to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. We believe that the government and the judges are delaying the decision because our girl is 14 years old,\" she explained.\n\nTabassum Yousaf, Younus' lawyer, told the ACN they hoped the law could have been applied for the first time in Huma's case. \"But evidently in Pakistan, these laws are formulated and approved only to improve the image of the country in front of the international community, ask for development funds, and freely trade Pakistani products on the European market,\" he said.\n\nAnother hearing in the case has been scheduled for March 4. In an email to \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, ICC President Jeff King responded to the court's ruling. \"Pakistan's High Court decision to rule in favor of underage marriage is wrong on so many levels. In the last few years, the world has been awakened to the disastrous practice and effects of child marriage (child brides) through various organizations and brave female voices throughout the world,\" King wrote. \"I've yet to see these campaigners, though, touch on one aspect of the practice that allows Christians around the world to have their daughters kidnapped, often never to be seen again. That is the issue of forced marriage and forced conversion in Muslim countries.\"\n\nKing explained that young Christian women are frequently targeted by Muslim men. \"In the most fundamentalist Muslim countries (i.e., Pakistan, Egypt, and others), where Christians are a minority, young Christian girls are routinely targeted by Muslim men,\" he noted. \"It usually starts with a young Christian girl being approached by a Muslim boy or man with a request to date or marry. If these requests are ignored, she will start to hear how she's too pretty to be a Christian and other statements that represent a more dangerous level of harassment.\"\n\nThe ICC president adds that the family usually knows the perpetrator. \"Usually, and often tragically, the next step is that she will be kidnapped, drugged, beaten, and raped multiple times, and often the family knows who is responsible,\" King continued. \"In a fundamentalist, shame-based culture, the girl's prospects for marriage, and a decent life, are permanently ruined. She is left feeling incredibly useless and ashamed. Then, she will be presented with an offer to save her dignity by being married to her rapist. If she refuses, she will be raped and beaten repeatedly.\"\n\nKing says Pakistani law enforcement officials are of little help to parents. \"When the parents inquire of the police and try to get them to do something, they will be presented with a statement from their daughter saying that she has become a Muslim,\" he continued. \"If the Christian parents continue to fight, they're often slapped around and threatened with arrest. If the parents are especially brave, the daughter is often then dragged in front of them in a drugged state (with her torturer and rapist in the room) to say that she is a Muslim and does not wish to come home \u2013 never making eye contact with her parents.\"\n\nKing pointed out to \u2588\u2588\u2588 News that none of this is a rare occurrence, unfortunately. \"So it is with tremendous sadness that we receive the news that Pakistan's High Court has allowed this practice to continue. Even more tragically, it means that for 14-year-old Huma, whose case the trial was based on, will not be returned to her parents and is probably lost to them forever,\" he concluded.",
    " Title: California Positions Itself as a Progressive Counterbalance to Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia, a state that heavily favored Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, is gearing up to lead a progressive resistance against President-elect Donald Trump. The Golden State, home to industries such as Silicon Valley and Hollywood, is a political powerhouse for the left and contributes 13 percent to the nation's gross domestic product.\n\nCalifornia's political landscape is marked by a powerful group of Democratic politicians, including Senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein, Governor Jerry Brown, and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The state also has a growing Latino population, making it a focal point for Trump's immigration agenda, as about 40 percent of the state's population is Hispanic.\n\nOutgoing Representative Xavier Becerra, who was appointed earlier this month to succeed Sen.-elect Kamala Harris as state attorney general, will lead the local charge in California's immigration fight. Becerra has already vowed to fight federal immigration enforcement in his new role through legislation and litigation.\n\nCalifornia mayors have also pledged to resist aggressive immigration enforcement. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has announced a fund to defend immigrants from deportation and has maintained his commitment to keeping L.A. a \"sanctuary\" city.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, who will be the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee next year, will lead the opposition to Trump's pick for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions. Becerra and Feinstein have stated that all legal options, including litigation and political action, are on the table when it comes to fighting to defend California's policies.\n\nVoter turnout in California was 73.5 percent, the state's second-highest in history. This is almost 20 points higher than the 54.4 percent national turnout rate, according to figures from the United States Elections Project. Some believe the higher turnout reflects the interest taken in the election by Hispanics who were concerned about Trump's promises to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall and implement mass deportations.\n\nTrump has accused California of voter fraud, claiming this contributed to his loss in the popular vote. However, Trump and his allies have provided no evidence to support these accusations. California's Secretary of State, Alex Padilla, has criticized Trump's comments about voter fraud, stating they are unsubstantiated, reckless, and unbecoming of a president-elect.\n\nWhile California and Trump have been at odds, state politicians say they are willing to work with the president-elect where their interests align. However, they have also made it clear they will confront Trump's administration where necessary, particularly on issues such as Social Security, Medicare, and healthcare reform.\n\nKenneth Romero, executive director of the bipartisan National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators, argued that California's local leaders are likely to turn to the issue of states' rights in making their case against Trump's agenda. Romero suggested that the potential conflict between California and the federal government is not unprecedented, as states have resisted federal policy in the past.",
    " Title: \"Democrats' Call to Abolish ICE Gains Mainstream Support, Sparking Political Debate\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe call to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has moved from the fringes of the Democratic Party to the mainstream, with several high-profile Democrats expressing support for the idea. In an interview with Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" President Trump predicted that Democrats campaigning on the policy of abolishing ICE would face electoral defeat.\n\nTrump stated, \"Well I hope they keep thinking about it. Because they're going to get beaten so badly. You know ICE, these are the guys that go in and take MS-13, and they take them out. Because they're much tougher than MS-13, like by a factor of 10. And these are the ones \u2013 you get rid of ICE, you're going to have a country that you're going to be afraid to walk out of your house.\"\n\nThe shift in Democratic sentiment towards ICE is largely a response to the Trump administration's tough policies on illegal immigration, particularly the \"zero tolerance\" policy on detaining all illegal border crossers. In New York, far-left primary challenger Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an ICE opponent, shocked the party's establishment by beating Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Mayor Bill de Blasio have since added their support to the cause.\n\nGillibrand stated, \"I believe that [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] has become a deportation force \u2026 and that's why I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works.\" De Blasio said, \"We should abolish ICE.\"\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, and Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis, have also expressed support for abolishing ICE, with Harris suggesting the U.S. should consider \"starting from scratch.\"\n\nWhile the call to abolish ICE is gaining traction among Democrats, Trump and many Republicans are opposing the idea. Trump tweeted on Saturday that he was backing ICE agents and that there was \"zero chance\" of ICE being abolished. \"To the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements,\" he said.\n\nThe political debate over ICE is expected to continue as the 2020 election approaches, with both parties presenting contrasting views on immigration policy.",
    " Title: Book Unjust: Social Justice and the Unmaking of America Critiques Lack of Logical and Definitional Rigor\n\nArticle:\n\nNoah Rothman, a writer and editor at Commentary magazine, has recently published his first book, titled \"Unjust: Social Justice and the Unmaking of America.\" The book, far from being nonsensical, is described as crisp, insightful, and passionate. The central theme of the book, as captured in the title, is a critique of social justice, which Rothman argues is nonsensical due to its lack of interior logic and definitional rigor.\n\nRothman embarked on a quest to find a universally agreed-upon definition of social justice while writing his book, The Tyranny of Clich\u00e9s. However, he found that the term is used by various groups, including labor unions, universities, gay-rights groups, and even the American Nazi party, with each group claiming to be champions of social justice. The only disagreements hinged on who is most in need of this resource.\n\nCommon to most definitions of social justice is the concept of \"economic justice,\" which Rothman describes as \"distributive justice\" - the redistribution of wealth from the haves to the have-nots. However, Rothman argues that what social justice is really about is power, with its advocates seeking the power to do what they want, and using the label of social justice to justify their actions.\n\nRothman's book criticizes the Green party's social justice platform, which is nearly 60 pages long and includes planks such as stopping speech that perpetuates \"oppression and abuse,\" reform of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, sovereignty for Hawaii, compensation for gays and lesbians who have suffered from \"injustice,\" and the encouragement of young people's potential. Rothman argues that social justice is not a theory, but a wish list.\n\nRothman also discusses the connection between social justice and identity politics, arguing that historically oppressed or disadvantaged groups want payback in the name of social justice. He calls this \"retributive justice.\" According to this view, whites have historically enjoyed privileges that non-whites did not, and therefore non-whites are owed something, and \"white privilege\" must be overthrown. The argument follows the same form for males, heterosexuals, and so on.\n\nOne of the problems with this worldview, according to Rothman, is that individual circumstances are boiled away, with vast abstract categories of human beings being swept up into notions of collective guilt or victimhood. This is partly why philosopher Friedrich Hayek loathed the concept of social justice, seeing it as the very negation of plain old justice.\n\nWhen Rothman appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe to discuss his book, the reaction from critics often boiled down to the claim that he cannot criticize social justice because he does not belong to a category of people in need of social justice. A white man's arguments can be dismissed out of hand because of the color of his skin.\n\nRothman's book argues that social justice is a kind of magical incantation that renders inconvenient impediments to its champions' agenda illegitimate. Free speech is good unless it hurts certain groups. Property rights are fine except when social justice dictates that someone else needs your stuff more. The right to confront your accuser is negated by the need to \"believe all women.\" Even facts are irrelevant in the face of social justice.\n\nIn conclusion, Rothman's book, \"Unjust: Social Justice and the Unmaking of America,\" provides a critical analysis of the concept of social justice, arguing that it lacks interior logic and definitional rigor, and is often used as a justification for power grabs and the suppression of free speech, property rights, and due process.",
    " Title: Democrats Emphasize Potential Public Safety Risks Amid Sequester Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocrats in the U.S. Congress have shifted their focus from warnings about mid-air plane crashes, troop deaths, and tainted meat to emphasize the potential impact of sequester cuts on law enforcement and public safety. The shift in strategy aims to sway public opinion and place blame on the Republicans for the spending cuts.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) has highlighted the consequences of the sequester cuts on local law enforcement officials, who rely on federal grants for staffing and equipment purchases. Mikulski stated that the spending cuts jeopardize the ability to \"catch the bad guys,\" referring to white-collar crime, street crime, and human trafficking.\n\nRep. G.K. Butterfield (D-NC) suggested that a significant event would be necessary to change the public's perception of sequestration. He noted that the lack of immediate, visible effects of the cuts has made it challenging to convince voters of the dangers they pose.\n\nIn the realm of public safety, Democrats have emphasized the potential increase in crime and other dangers. Federal prison union officials have pointed to past budget cuts and staffing shortages, citing a federal prison inmate's stabbing of a guard last month in Canaan, PA, as an example of the potential consequences of sequester cuts. Dale Deshotel, president of the Council of Prison Locals, expressed growing concern as the Bureau of Prisons begins to cut $339 million this fiscal year and impose 12 mandated furlough days for all its employees.\n\nAdditionally, warnings have been issued about the potential increase in illicit drugs reaching U.S. soil due to sequester cuts. At a hearing last week before the House Armed Services Committee, Southern Command chief Marine Gen. John Kelly stated that sequestration could result in a loss of critical air and water surveillance for monitoring cocaine trafficking. Gen. Kelly warned that if these assets are reduced or eliminated, all cocaine would reach U.S. shores, with more likely to follow.\n\nPolls indicate that roughly half of Americans are undecided about sequestration due to a lack of knowledge about the effects of the cuts. Frank Newport, Gallup's editor-in-chief, described the situation as a \"fascinating case of wait and see.\"\n\n-End of Article-",
    " Title: The Ongoing Refugee Crisis in Europe: A Complex and Multifaceted Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nThe refugee crisis in Europe, characterized by the influx of desperate individuals fleeing conflicts in the Middle East, presents a complex and multifaceted challenge that defies simple solutions. While some may argue that there are no absolute solutions, it is crucial to acknowledge the humanitarian aspect of the situation and the need for international cooperation.\n\nThe immediate problem is the mass migration of individuals from the Middle East, seeking refuge from war and terrorism, into Europe. However, the current crisis cannot be addressed in isolation, as it has roots in both the past and the future.\n\nThe future is a significant constraint on the present response to the refugee crisis. As refugees settle in Europe, they will have children who will grow up with no memory of the Middle East. These new generations may face challenges integrating into Western societies, as their values may clash with those of their host countries. This could potentially lead to strife and even terrorism, as some may be influenced by extremist ideologies.\n\nThe capacity of any nation to absorb immigrants is not unlimited, especially when the cultures of the immigrants are antagonistic to the values of the host society. The admission of a foreign population, particularly one with a history of maintaining distinct cultural identities, presents long-term challenges.\n\nThe past and future of the refugee crisis cast a shadow over the present situation. The decision to admit foreign populations, especially those with a history of maintaining distinct identities, is an irreversible one. The Obama administration's policies in the Middle East, such as the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and the destabilization of governments in Egypt and Libya, have contributed to the current refugee crisis.\n\nWhile Middle Eastern countries could take in more refugees, oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia have not done so in significant numbers. The West, including the United States, could provide more financial aid to Middle Eastern countries like Jordan and Egypt, to ease the burden of the refugees they have already taken in. This approach may encounter less political opposition at home and could be a more effective means of addressing the underlying causes of the refugee crisis.\n\nA comprehensive solution to the refugee crisis will likely require a long-term, multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of the conflict in the Middle East and the challenges faced by refugees in integrating into Western societies. This may require a change in leadership and policy, as the current administration has been criticized for its handling of the situation in the Middle East.",
    " Title: Romney and Obama Differ on Iran Nuclear Policy and Middle East Intervention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past few days, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has focused on accusations that President Barack Obama has shown weakness and apologized for America, linking these actions to the recent protests in Cairo and the violence in Libya. During a speech in Fairfax, Virginia, on Thursday, Romney avoided discussing the challenges in dealing with Egypt and Libya, instead offering a general critique of the president's foreign policy.\n\nWhen asked about Iran's nuclear program, Romney and President Obama present different approaches. Obama has stated that he aims to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon but has resisted calls from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to set a \"red line\" that would warn Iran of potential military action if it continues to develop nuclear capabilities. In a phone call on Tuesday night, Obama and Netanyahu debated this issue.\n\nAccording to Paul Pillar, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a former senior official in the State Department under President George W. Bush, Romney would not tolerate Iran being \"one screwdriver's turn away from a nuclear weapon.\" However, Pillar did not specify where exactly Romney would draw the line.\n\nThe vagueness of Romney's stance is significant because, by some definitions, Iran already has the capability to produce a nuclear weapon, though it might take several months or years to realize this capability. Pillar stated, \"Once they get a weapon, or on the verge of getting it, it's too late.\"\n\nRomney has said he would never allow Iran to enrich uranium, suggesting he would enforce a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding that Iran \"suspend\" its production of all nuclear fuel. However, Iran was in violation of that demand during most of President Bush's second term, and suffered fewer economic consequences than it has under Obama, who has imposed the first sanctions against Iran's oil revenues.\n\nBoth Pillar and former ambassador Robert W. Kelley, who has served several Republican presidents, criticized Obama for being too cautious in supporting opposition forces in Syria. Kelley described Obama as too risk-averse in the Middle East, stating, \"We are not better off in letting things drift. We have 20,000 dead, and the more it goes on, the fewer choices we have.\"\n\nOn Egypt, Pillar suggested that the administration had failed to make clear that American aid was contingent on the protection of American interests. In fact, Obama's aides, during trips to Cairo, have been careful not to threaten pulling that aid, but they have warned the Egyptian authorities that Congressional approval could be difficult unless the country's leaders reaffirmed the peace treaty with Israel.\n\nKelley continued the Romney campaign's attack on a statement issued by the American Embassy in Cairo hours before protests began there, saying \"you don't issue a conciliatory statement that says we don't support freedom of speech.\" The statement did condemn a virulent anti-Muslim video that set off the violence, but it also included references to both the importance of free speech and religious tolerance.\n\nBoth men stopped short of saying that the United States should provide lethal arms. A senior Obama administration official said that \"sounds a lot like they are endorsing our position.\"",
    " Title: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Calls for Briefing on U.S. Military Strike, Criticizes Trump's Syria Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has demanded a briefing on the U.S. military operation that resulted in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In a statement, Pelosi expressed the need for Congress to be informed about the raid and the Administration's strategy in the region.\n\nPelosi stated, \"The House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region.\" She further added, \"Our military and allies deserve strong, smart, and strategic leadership from Washington.\"\n\nPresident Trump, in announcing the operation, singled out Pelosi, stating that congressional leaders could not be trusted in the planning of the attack in Syria. Trump said, \"Washington is a leaking machine.\"\n\nPelosi commended the U.S. military for carrying out the raid but did not mention Trump, who had made the killing of al-Baghdadi a priority and gave the order for the strike.\n\nPelosi also criticized Trump's military policy in Syria, stating that it had potentially strengthened ISIS. This criticism mirrors comments made by Democratic presidential hopeful and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nTrump faced harsh criticism from both sides of the aisle this month when he pulled out U.S. troops from the Turkey-Syria border, which allowed a Turkish military advance on U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the region. Pelosi noted, \"This month, the House passed a joint resolution on an overwhelmingly bipartisan 354-60 basis which rejects President Trump\u2019s green-lighting of Turkish aggression into Syria against our Kurdish partners, and calls on him to present a clear strategy to defeat ISIS.\"",
    " Title: New IRS Withholding Guidelines Result in Increased Take-Home Pay for Many Workers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe new tax overhaul is beginning to deliver a change that many workers are welcoming \u2014 bigger paychecks. Workers are starting to see more take-home pay as employers implement the new withholding guidelines from the IRS, which dictate how much employers withhold from pay for federal taxes. Those whose checks have remained the same should not worry, as employers have until Feb. 15 to make the changes.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has estimated that the new rules will mean more take-home pay for about 90 percent of American workers. The amount of extra cash depends on several factors, such as workers' income, how often they are paid, and the number of withholdings allowances they claim on their IRS Form W-4 with their employer.\n\nWorkers who have already experienced the change have welcomed the extra money, with some seeing an increase of a few dollars to a few hundred dollars. Wayne Love, who works in managed care in Spring Hill, Florida, got an extra $200 in his paycheck last week, which he said will help offset a $300 increase in the cost of his health insurance.\n\nJulia Ketchum, a secretary at a public high school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said she was pleasantly surprised her pay went up $1.50 a week. She didn't think her pay would go up at all, let alone this soon. That adds up to $78 a year, which she said will more than cover her Costco membership for the year.\n\nTodd Anderson of Texas and his fiance, who are both educators, got an extra $200 in their paychecks combined that they plan to use to cover the costs of a second baby on its way.\n\nAccording to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a middle-income household would on average get a tax cut of $930 this year, lifting their after-tax income by about 1.6 percent. However, that increase won't be perfectly reflected in their paychecks, as lower tax withholding on paychecks is just a piece of a complicated set of changes to tax law.\n\nAs a result, taxpayers may find they are unintentionally over- or underwithholding for their taxes if they don't do some legwork. Senators Ron Wyden and Richard Neal, both Democrats, have asked the Government Accountability Office to analyze the new tables to make sure workers' paychecks weren't being systematically underwithheld, which would make paychecks bigger now but lead to a bigger bill at tax time.\n\nExperts suggest that all taxpayers take a look at the new IRS calculator when it becomes available later in February to ensure they are having the correct amount withheld. And they should update the information on their W-4 after the IRS releases a revised version later this year.\n\nThe IRS said the new withholding tables should produce an accurate withholding amount for people with simpler tax situations. However, tax experts say those who will still itemize, have larger families, or more complicated tax situations may want to take a closer look.\n\n\"If they haven't done it before, this is a really good year to talk to your tax professional,\" said Pete Isberg, vice president of government relations for ADP, a payroll provider.\n\nThe IRS, payroll, and tax professionals have been scrambling to react to the passage of the new tax law. And the IRS says it plans to make further changes involving withholding matters in 2019. Many in the industry say they expect the IRS to update the W-4 form in 2019 in a more dramatic fashion to fully reflect the scope of the law.\n\nNo worker should anticipate a negative impact from the new withholding table if their pay remained the same, said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior researcher at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. However, someone who got a raise may face a higher tax rate as a result. And some corporations have been handing out bonuses and wage increases in reaction to passage of the law. A worker's net pay may also fall if other factors that go into their paycheck changed \u2014 such as an increase in health insurance premiums or higher state taxes.\n\nStill, a little extra money in the hands of most Americans may also help boost support of President Donald Trump and his tax plan. Trump and the Republican backers of the plan have deflected criticism of the legislation, insisting that Americans will come to love the new law when they see their heftier paychecks.\n\n\"It's tough to be upset about more money in my pocket,\" said Jefferey Snively, an aerospace engineer who got a 4 percent bump in his last paycheck due to the lower tax rate. He said that's not enough to feel like a windfall or change his spending habits, but is a pleasant change. Yet, he thinks the tax overhaul wasn't really about him or other workers, but more about corporations and the wealthy.\n\n\"I think the people this bill made the most difference for are the ones who needed it least,\" he said.",
    " Title: Former President Obama's Midterm Endorsements Divide Democrats Over Timing and Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer President Barack Obama's midterm endorsement list has sparked controversy among some Democrats, with critics arguing that the list, which includes 81 endorsements, came too late in the midterm season and failed to significantly impact Democratic primaries.\n\nStrategists, former Obama aides, and fundraisers interviewed by various sources expressed confusion over Obama's list, which was released after most states had held their primaries. One former senior Obama administration official stated, \"I think a lot of us have wondered why he didn't feel the need to get involved earlier. There are a lot of folks that could have used his help much earlier. And there are a lot of people who think he should put a stamp on the party.\"\n\nObama's decision to largely stay away from primaries is consistent with the behavior of many other former presidents, who have generally sought to stay above internal party fights. However, some Democrats argue that the political environment demands more input from Obama, citing the need for his influence in the face of Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nDemocratic strategist Brad Bannon stated, \"These are not traditional times. He's the most popular Democrat in our nation, and we really need all the help we can get. So if I were advising him, I would have told him to get out there much sooner and get in the trenches because we're playing high stakes poker.\"\n\nThe release of the endorsement list was consistent with Obama's post-Oval Office goal of seeking to stay above the fray and to not become more of a foil to Trump. Aides and others close to Obama have repeatedly stated that his desire is to allow a new crop of Democrats to take over the party.\n\nDespite Obama's decision to stay out of primaries, his endorsement was seen as helpful in some races. Katie Merrill, who helps head up the super PAC Fight Back California, stated that Obama's endorsements \"created quite a buzz and are very helpful to the candidates\" in California.\n\nHowever, Obama's decision to stay out of primaries has also left some former aides running for office without his endorsement. In Texas, for example, Ed Meier, who served as a State Department official under the Obama administration, fell short in a congressional primary. Similarly, Alison Kiehl Friedman, who was running for Congress in Virginia, and Sam Jammal, who was running for a seat in California, also failed to secure Obama's endorsement.\n\nOne top Obama fundraiser stated, \"His endorsement during the primary would have changed the outcome of a number of races. Some of the candidates lost because the opposition used the lack of endorsements as a sign of weak job performance.\"\n\nSome former aides and donors argue that Obama didn't want to choose sides and hear from allies of various candidates. The president still needs many fundraisers to help build his library and foundation.\n\nHowever, others, such as Katie Merrill and Seth Bringman, a Democratic strategist based in Ohio, argue that Obama's endorsements were helpful to candidates in their respective states. Bringman stated, \"Just knowing that their campaigns are on his radar energized volunteers and helped candidates raise money. There's even a little impatience to get him back on the trail, because he can come to any media market in the Buckeye State and help us get back a lot of the voters we lost in 2016.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Obama's endorsement list, some strategists argue that his decision to stay out of primaries has hurt the party. One Democratic strategist stated, \"I was on a call this morning where it was coming up a lot. I think a lot of people say it as lazy, a bit half-assed and a little too methodical. There are ramifications for this, and I hope we don't suffer the consequences. We can't just go red to blue. We need to make states blue for the long term.\"\n\n\"Now's not the time to sit out and be too cute by half,\" the strategist continued. \"Where's the audacity of hope?\"",
    " Title: Court Sides with Ohio Business Owners Challenging Birth Control Mandate under ACA\n\nArticle:\n\nA divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has sided with two Ohio business owners, Francis and Philip M. Gilardi, who challenged the birth control mandate under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on religious grounds. The Gilardis, owners of Freshway Foods and Freshway Logistics of Sidney, Ohio, argue that the mandate to provide contraceptive coverage would force them to violate their Roman Catholic beliefs and moral values by providing contraceptives such as the morning-after pill for their employees.\n\nThe ruling, one of several on the birth control issue, is likely to be resolved by the Supreme Court. There are at least three other rulings by federal appeals courts on the mandate: one sided with Oklahoma businesses, and two sided with the Obama administration in challenges brought by Pennsylvania and Michigan companies.\n\nWriting for the majority, Judge Janice Rogers Brown stated that the mandate \"trammels the right of free exercise -- a right that lies at the core of our constitutional liberties -- as protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\"\n\nFriday's ruling reversed a lower court ruling that had denied the Gilardis' request for a preliminary injunction to block the Department of Health and Human Services from enforcing the mandate against them as business owners. The appeals court ruled that the lower court erred when it concluded the Gilardis were unlikely to succeed on the merits, and sent the case back to the lower court to consider other factors for an injunction.\n\nHowever, Brown upheld the lower court's dismissal of an injunction for the brothers' companies, writing, \"we have no basis for concluding a secular organization can exercise religion.\"\n\nIn an opinion dissenting from the court's main holding in the case, Judge Harry T. Edwards wrote that legislative restrictions may trump religious exercise. He asked what, if the Gilardis' companies were exempted from covering contraception, would stop another company from seeking an exemption from a requirement to cover vaccines?\n\n\"The mandate does not require the Gilardis to encourage Freshway's employees to use contraceptives any more directly than they do by authorizing Freshway to pay wages,\" wrote Edwards. He added that the Gilardis remain free to publicly express their disapproval of contraceptives.\n\nComing from the other direction, Judge A. Raymond Randolph joined Brown's main conclusion about the Gilardis but dissented from her conclusions about Freshway companies' exercise of religion.\n\n\"Why limit the free-exercise right to religious organizations when many business corporations adhere to religious dogma?\" asked Randolph. \"If non-religious organizations do not have free-exercise rights, why do non-religious natural persons (atheists, for example) possess them?\"\n\nThe Gilardis' lawyer, Francis Manion, senior counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, an anti-abortion legal group that focuses on constitutional law, said he was pleased that the court accepted the \"bulk\" of his arguments, but will appeal the part of the ruling on the free exercise religious rights of corporations.\n\n\"It's a big victory, but not total,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\nIn a statement, the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United, a church-state watchdog group, said the Friday's ruling turns \"the concept of religious freedom on its head.\"\n\n\"Religious liberty means the right to make decisions for yourself, not other people,\" Lynn said. \"Freedom of religion should never be a blank check to meddle in the personal medical decisions of others.\"\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services was unable to comment on pending litigation.",
    " Title: Former Presidents' Public Criticisms: A Comparative Analysis of Obama and Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent series of public statements, former President Barack Obama has continued his criticisms of his successor, President Donald Trump. The former president's charges, however, have been paradoxical, as he seems to attribute Trump's successes to his own administration, while also criticizing Trump's policies as pernicious and failing.\n\nObama's economic policies during his tenure were markedly different from Trump's. Obama had argued that the U.S. could not drill its way out of oil shortages and advocated for making the use of coal expensive. In contrast, Trump has championed domestic fossil-fuel production, pipeline construction, and deregulation of fracking and horizontal drilling.\n\nEconomic indicators suggest that Trump's economic policies have been successful. Since Trump's election, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed approximately 7,000 points, unemployment has hit near-record lows, wage gains are up, and the economy is growing. In 2016, economist and Obama supporter Paul Krugman predicted a global recession, but the U.S. economy is currently on track to match or exceed Trump's promise of 3% annualized GDP growth over a twelve-month period.\n\nIt is worth noting that, historically, presidents are held accountable for the state of the economy during their tenure, regardless of whether their policies had a direct impact on economic conditions. Trump ran on a platform of economic revitalization, promising deregulation, fair trade, and tax reform. His policies, if successful, could be seen as a vindication of his approach, while failures could be attributed to missteps in implementation.\n\nAs of now, it is too early to make definitive judgments about Trump's legacy. It may be prudent to wait until the end of his term before evaluating his administration's successes or failures. Similarly, former President Obama might benefit from taking a step back and allowing history to adjudicate his own economic and foreign policy record.\n\nThe contrasting worldviews of Obama and Trump offer a unique opportunity for historical analysis. History will ultimately decide whether a more managed or more deregulated economy works best, and whether a focus on traditional energy sources or an emphasis on subsidized green energy is preferable.\n\nIn the past, ex-presidents such as Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush have chosen to leave the political limelight at the end of their tenures, allowing history to be the judge of their relative successes or failures. Obama, like his predecessors Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Obama himself, has been more inclined to remain politically active and to engage in public discourse about his successor.\n\nAs of now, there are four living ex-presidents (Carter, Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama) and five living former vice presidents (Walter Mondale, Dan Quayle, Al Gore, Dick Cheney, and Joe Biden). If all ex-presidents and ex-vice presidents were to weigh in nonstop on the current president and present-day politics, the result would be as chaotic as it would be boring. It may be wise for all former presidents to take a step back and allow history to be the final arbiter of their legacies.",
    " Title: GOP Candidates' Inflammatory Language and American Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nThe use of extreme rhetoric by Republican presidential candidates, notably Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, has sparked nationwide debates about American political polarization. The candidates' inflammatory language, such as Cruz's call for carpet-bombing the Islamic State group and Trump's characterization of Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug traffickers, has been a subject of media attention.\n\nFrederick Mayer, professor of public policy, political science, and environment at Duke University, explained that the candidates have found a way to frame their message that resonates with the anxieties about American decline, threats from terrorists, and perceived threats to the American way of life.\n\nIn his State of the Union address last Tuesday, President Barack Obama assured Americans that the country is not in decline, despite inflammatory claims. He stated, \"I told you earlier all the talk of America\u2019s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you something\u2014the United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth, period.\"\n\nMayer noted that factors such as low unemployment, low crime levels, and fewer instances of terrorism on American soil should also ease the anxiety of Americans. He said, \"It\u2019s ironic because you can make the claim that we have less to fear today than just about any people in any time in history.\"\n\nJunior Adam Lemon, president of the Duke College Republicans, said that extreme rhetoric was necessary for the success of Trump and Cruz in a field of more than 15 candidates, where standing out in any way was imperative. He also noted that cable news has used stories about Trump to boost ratings.\n\nFreshman Steve Hassey, communications director for Duke Democrats, said that Trump's polarizing nature contributes to the mass coverage of him, making the news even more polarizing.\n\nBoth Lemon and Mayer discussed how news can have a negative impact when it focuses on polarizing comments. However, Mayer expressed optimism that bipartisan reform is possible and will occur on certain issues. On campus, there have been a few bipartisan discussions, such as the Battle of the Brains debate between college Democrats and Republicans hosted by Duke Student Government last November.\n\nDespite the bipartisan discussions, Lemon noted that there are barriers to fostering discussion between students of opposing political parties on campus. He said, \"There are a lot more liberals on campus than conservatives. Liberals tend to talk amongst themselves. Conservatives are afraid to express their opinions, so they don\u2019t really talk, and neither side is really willing to engage too much.\"\n\nMayer attributed the polarization and the lack of engagement between the two sides to something more than just extreme rhetoric. He said, \"At some deep level, many of the problems we\u2019ve been talking about are really manifestations of a loss of trust in each other, in our institutions, and the like. This whole dysfunction is a trust problem. We stopped trusting institutions. We don\u2019t trust politicians. A world where you have very little trust is a much less functional world.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth Criticizes President Trump's Actions Regarding Peaceful Protesters and Military\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth, a former U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and combat veteran of the Iraq War, has criticized President Donald Trump's actions regarding peaceful protesters and the use of the military. In a statement, Duckworth expressed her disapproval of the president's actions during the recent protests in Washington D.C., stating that Trump had violated the First Amendment rights of Americans to peaceably assemble for a redress of grievances.\n\nDuring the protests, federal law enforcement forcibly removed Americans, including a priest and seminarian, to clear a path for the president during a photo-op. Duckworth argued that Trump's actions revealed his contempt for the truly faithful and disrespected the troops by threatening to exploit the military to achieve political goals.\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark A. Milley, were also criticized by Duckworth for their actions during the protests. Duckworth stated that Esper's excuse that he didn't know where he was going was not an exoneration, but rather a \"downright chilling\" demonstration of blindly following the president when he violates the Constitution.\n\nDuckworth also expressed her disappointment in Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who defended Trump's threats in the New York Times, suggesting that he would pervert what the military stands for to earn a slap on the back from the current occupant of the Oval Office.\n\nDuckworth concluded her statement by emphasizing the importance of the ballot box as the last off-ramp for Americans to make their views known and to prevent any commander in chief from using the military to silence their neighbors and drive further wedges between Americans. Duckworth stated that Americans deserve a commander in chief who unites the nation, not one who abuses the military to push the country further apart.",
    " Title: Franklin Graham Criticizes Robert Gates for Reversing Boy Scouts' Gay Scoutmaster Ban\n\nThe prominent evangelist Franklin Graham has denounced Robert Gates, the President of the Boy Scouts of America, for his call to end the organization's ban on openly gay scoutmasters. In a post on Facebook, Graham accused Gates of putting children at risk and lacking the moral courage to uphold traditional values.\n\nGates, the former Secretary of Defense, made his remarks at the Boy Scouts' annual meeting in Atlanta on Thursday. He stated that the status quo in the organization's membership standards could not be sustained, and called the ban on openly gay scoutmasters unsustainable.\n\nGates clarified that he would not revoke the membership charters of any local troops known to have gay adults in supervisory roles. This apparent reference to a New York chapter hiring an openly gay scoutmaster this spring prompted Graham's response.\n\n\"Robert Gates, shame on you for not having the moral courage to do what is right,\" Graham wrote. He expressed concern that the organization was bending to LGBT activist groups and could put young, innocent boys at risk.\n\nGates stated that he was not asking the organization's board to make an immediate policy change at the annual meeting. However, he emphasized the need for change, stating, \"I must speak as plainly and bluntly to you as I spoke to presidents when I was director of CIA and secretary of defense.\"\n\nGates oversaw the repeal of the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy, which allowed openly gay service members in the U.S. armed forces, while he was at the Pentagon. He was elected as the Boy Scouts' president in 2014, after the organization voted in 2013 to allow openly gay scouts.\n\nAdvocates for gay scouts have cheered Gates' remarks, while others have expressed ambivalence. David Barton, an Orange County, California, cubmaster and father of two boys in scouting, told the Los Angeles Times, \"It would be silly to think that a higher percentage of gay men want to do harm to boys than straight men, but I still have concerns about gay scout leaders accompanying boys on camping trips.\"\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America has faced criticism and lost partnerships with companies such as Lockheed Martin and Walt Disney due to the ban on openly gay scoutmasters. The organization's decision to potentially lift the ban remains a contentious issue, with supporters and opponents voicing their opinions on both sides.",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Launches \"Impeachment Defense Task Force,\" Promises Doubtful Fundraising Incentives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the growing calls for impeachment from Democratic lawmakers, President Donald Trump's reelection campaign has launched an \"Impeachment Defense Task Force\" and initiated a fundraising campaign. The email, sent out Tuesday afternoon, solicits donations to support the president and promises to add donors to the \"Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.\"\n\nThe email also claims that immediate contributions will be \"double matched,\" a claim that is unlikely to be true due to federal campaign finance laws that impose strict limits on political donations. The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about the \"Official Impeachment Defense Task Force,\" how many donors had joined, or how it plans to \"double-match\" contributions.\n\nThe number of Democrats calling for impeachment has gradually increased over the summer, but as recently as last week, this step was still opposed by the Democratic Party leadership. Following revelations that Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate discredited allegations against Joe Biden and withheld military aid from the country to ramp up pressure, dozens of Democratic lawmakers joined the call to begin impeachment proceedings.\n\nAhead of a 5 p.m. press conference Tuesday afternoon, at which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to publicly call for an impeachment inquiry, the Trump campaign fired off its fundraising pitch. The email states that the \"Impeachment claims have nothing to do with the President - the Democrats thrive on silencing and intimidating his supporters, like YOU.\" It goes on to say, \"We won't stand for this any longer, and neither should you.\"\n\nThe email also suggests that by donating to the campaign, supporters would be defending the very integrity of America: \"As a member of the Official Impeachment Defense Task Force, you will be a leader in defending the President against these baseless and disgusting attacks. You will be responsible for defending American Greatness. The future of American freedom rests on the shoulders of men and women willing to defend it from these hateful attacks, and today is a day for action.\"\n\nThe fundraising appeal claimed that Trump had personally requested to see a list of people who had joined his \"Official Impeachment Defense Taskforce\" and urged donors to send their money before 3:30 p.m., when the list was supposedly to be sent to the president. Shortly after the deadline passed, Trump's campaign sent a nearly identical email, this one saying the deadline was 4 p.m.\n\nCampaigns have fairly wide latitude to make promises in campaign fundraising emails, so Team Trump's claims of an official \"Task Force\" or that Trump would personally review the names of donors don't have to be true. Another suspect claim: the email's pledge that donations would be \"double-matched.\"\n\nDonor match programs are common in the nonprofit fundraising world and are considered to be highly effective in encouraging donors who might be on the fence about giving. In the nonprofit world, a match program typically involves a one or several particularly generous donors, who are poised to write big checks if smaller donors start giving. However, in the political sphere, federal campaign finance laws make things a little more complicated, since individual donors are legally capped at giving no more than $5,400 to a campaign per election cycle. That means a single generous donor can't \"match\" new small donations. If a campaign wants to raise money on any large scale, even a handful of generous matching donors won't work\u2014hundreds or thousands would be necessary. It's unlikely that would really happen.",
    " Title: Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus to Close After Over a Century of Operation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, a staple of American entertainment for over a century, has announced its closure, according to a press release from Feld Entertainment, the company that has owned the circus for the past 50 years.\n\nIn the statement, CEO Kenneth Feld explained, \"I have made the difficult business decision that Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey\u00ae will hold its final performances in May of this year.\"\n\nThe decision was attributed to high operating costs and the decline of ticket sales, which made the circus an unsustainable business for the company. Feld further elaborated, \"After the transition of the elephants off the road, we saw an even more dramatic drop in ticket sales.\"\n\nBefore taking its final bow, the Ringling Bros. circus will perform 30 shows across the United States between now and May. The exact date and location of the final performance have not been disclosed.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Praise for Sen. Orrin Hatch Amidst Political Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare moment of bipartisan unity, the United States Senate recognized Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) as the longest-serving Republican senator in history on Thursday. The occasion, which saw the majority and minority leaders put down their swords, marked a brief pause in the ongoing partisan tensions that have characterized the new Congress.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Republican leader, praised Sen. Hatch, not only for his political career but also for his work as a songwriter, with gold and platinum albums to his name. The Democratic leader, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), described Sen. Hatch as a \"terrific guy\" and an \"honorable man,\" acknowledging his ability to work across the aisle despite deep ideological differences.\n\nSen. Hatch, in his response, expressed a \"gee, shucks\" attitude towards the praise and pleaded for patience with President Trump and for senators to work together. He expressed concern about the state of the Senate and the presidency, stating, \"I'm concerned about this body and how it's going. I'm also concerned about the president.\"\n\nSen. Hatch also praised President Trump's cabinet choices and asked the Senate to be \"a little bit considerate in criticizing\" the president, as he is a brand new president coming out of the private sector. He also expressed hope for a reduction in political animosities, stating, \"I'm hoping that we can set aside some of these animosities, give the president his cabinet and his leaders, so that he has at least a shot at pulling this country out of the mess it's in.\"\n\nThe slow pace of confirming cabinet nominees was a point of concern for Sen. Hatch, who expressed a desire for the Senate to continue its debates and arguments while maintaining a sense of comradeship and working together. He also invoked his work with the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and their ability to find common ground despite their ideological differences.\n\nSen. Hatch also praised both Sen. McConnell and Schumer, stating, \"These are two really potentially great leaders. Together, they could really help us save this country.\" He concluded by expressing a desire for the Senate to continue its political debates but not let them consume everything, stating, \"We have to have some politics here or this would be an uninteresting body. But we don't have to have it on everything.\"\n\nSen. Schumer acknowledged Sen. Hatch's service to the country and thanked him for his kind words. The Senate adjourned at 2:30 a.m., having tussled its way to a party-line confirmation of Tom Price as the next secretary of Health and Human Services. The political winds resumed, and the party differences flared once again.",
    " Title: Trump Family Files Lawsuit Against Deutsche Bank and Capital One to Block House Subpoenas\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump and several family members have filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One to block subpoenas issued by House Democrats seeking the president's financial records. The lawsuit, filed on Monday in New York, argues that the subpoenas serve \"no legitimate or lawful purpose.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, which is the latest escalation in Trump's fight against mounting House investigations, claims that the subpoenas are designed to \"rummage through every aspect\" of the president's personal finances, businesses, and private information. House Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) have described the lawsuit as a \"meritless lawsuit\" not designed to succeed but to delay accountability.\n\nDemocrats have said they are seeking Trump's financial records as part of investigations into potential foreign influence on the U.S. political process and the abuse of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes. Deutsche Bank, a German lender that has served as Trump's go-to lender for years, has faced scrutiny for money-laundering scandals.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of the president, his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump, and the Trump Organization. Deutsche Bank intends to begin producing documents in response to the subpoena on May 6, and Capital One also feels obligated to comply before May 6 absent court intervention, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit describes a sweeping inquiry into the Trump family's finances going back decades. The two banks provide the Trumps with numerous \"personal, family, and business accounts.\" The committees, the Trumps' lawyers said, have refused to provide copies of the subpoenas to the Trump family, and their scope was learned from Deustche Bank and Capital One. The committees are seeking \"all banking and financial records not just concerning the individual plaintiffs, but also their own family members,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that the subpoenas violate the Right to Financial Privacy Act. Lawyers representing the Trumps include Marc Mukasey, a former law firm partner of Rudy Giuliani's, the president's personal lawyer. In a statement, Mukasey and Patrick Strawbridge, who is also representing the Trumps in the case, said the lawsuit was filed to \"protect the privacy rights of the President, his family, and their businesses.\"\n\nMonday's lawsuit comes a week after the president asked a federal court to block the House Oversight and Reform Committee's subpoena to accounting firm Mazars USA. The Democrat-led committee subpoenaed the firm to obtain eight years of Trump's financial records. The Oversight Committee said it needs the documents in order to corroborate testimony from former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, who alleged that the president artificially inflated and deflated the value of his assets for his personal benefit.\n\nDuring an explosive public hearing in February, Cohen disclosed copies of Trump's financial statements, which he said were turned over to Deutsche Bank as Trump was seeking a loan to place a bid on an NFL team, the Buffalo Bills. Those statements, according to Cohen, contained false information. The committee has requested similar records from Capital One, which asked for a \"friendly\" subpoena before it could comply.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Republicans have rushed to Trump's defense amid the onslaught of investigations and subpoenas, claiming Democrats are abusing their authority to take down the president and eventually impeach him. Democratic leaders remain opposed to launching impeachment proceedings against Trump, preferring instead to continue investigating the president for obstruction of justice allegations and financial misdeeds.",
    " Title: Jury in Paul Manafort Trial Sends Four Questions to Judge During Deliberations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe jury in the trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has yet to reach a verdict, with deliberations ongoing as of Thursday evening. The jury sent four questions to Judge T.S. Ellis III during the day, but he answered only two of them.\n\nOne question pertained to the charges related to Manafort's offshore accounts, which contained tens of millions of dollars. Prosecutors charged Manafort with four counts of failing to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR), a legally required form to disclose foreign holdings to the U.S. government. The jury inquired about the FBAR filing requirements if a person owned less than 50% of a company and had no signatory authority. Judge Ellis answered this question, stating that if a person controlled the disposition of money from the account or if the listed owner of the account was acting as an agent for that person, the person would be legally required to file an FBAR.\n\nAnother question concerned the definition of a \"shelf company,\" a term used to describe Manafort's complex offshore holdings structured as inactive companies in Cyprus. The jury asked for the definition of a shelf company, but Judge Ellis declined to answer, instructing the jury to rely on their collective recollection.\n\nJurors also asked Judge Ellis to define the concept of \"reasonable doubt\" again, as Manafort's lawyers emphasized during their closing argument that the prosecution must prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, a high and difficult standard to meet. Judge Ellis answered this question by telling jurors that prosecutors do not have to prove their case beyond \"all possible doubt,\" but instead beyond doubt that is based on reason.\n\nLastly, the jury asked whether they could get a list of which particular pieces of evidence are said to match up with each of the 18 separate charges against Manafort. Judge Ellis declined to provide such a list. The jury's deliberations will continue on Friday.",
    " Title: New IRS Commissioner Vows to Restore Trust, Address Scandals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his first appearance before a Congressional committee, newly appointed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Daniel Werfel has pledged to restore trust in the tax collection agency, following allegations of political targeting of conservative groups. Werfel, who has been in office for 12 days, has ordered a review of a \"broad spectrum of IRS operations\" and installed new leadership at several critical levels of the IRS.\n\nDuring Monday's hearing of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, Werfel called the conduct \"inappropriate and unacceptable.\" The hearing followed the release of a report in May by the IRS Inspector General, which revealed that during the 2010 and 2012 elections, groups with conservative-sounding names that applied for tax-exempt status were singled out for extended questioning by an IRS office in Cincinnati.\n\nThe hearing saw members of Congress from both parties criticizing IRS misconduct. Rep. Hal Rogers (R) of Kentucky, chairman of the full appropriations committee, stated that the IRS \"has committed grave violations of the public trust\" and that \"we will not tolerate another political enemies list.\"\n\nIn addition to the political targeting allegations, the IRS is facing scrutiny over \"incredible waste\" in IRS spending on employee conferences and videos. The Inspector General's office is scheduled to release a report on the conferences on Tuesday, which the Associated Press reports will show the IRS spent $50 million to hold 220 employee conferences between 2010 and 2012.\n\nAmong the embarrassing evidence is a video showing IRS employees dancing to the rhythm and blues song \"Cupid Shuffle\" at a 2010 conference. Rep. Rita Lowey (D) of New York, the ranking Democrat on the full Appropriations Committee, said reports of the spending on employee conferences left her \"simply wondering what the IRS was thinking.\"\n\nThe IRS scandals come at an especially sensitive time for the agency, as it will play a key role in implementing the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature legislative achievement. The Obama administration is seeking a 9 percent increase in IRS funding for the federal budget year that starts in October. Representative Crenshaw said Congress would have to \"think very carefully about how much money to provide the IRS.\"\n\nAt Monday's hearing, Commissioner Werfel stated, \"The solution here is not more money.\" He said \"the right starting point is\" finding the \"optimal footprint\" for agency operations and only then turning to the question of agency funding.\n\nThe political impact of the controversy has been on display. On CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, Rep. Darrell Issa (R) of California said interviews with workers in the Cincinnati IRS office show the targeting of conservative groups was \"a problem that was coordinated in all likelihood right out of Washington headquarters \u2013 and we're getting to proving it.\"\n\nRepresentative Lowey asked IRS Inspector General J. Russell George whether there was evidence that the targeting of conservative groups was ordered by the White House. \"Within the White House, no,\" Mr. George replied.\n\nCongressional scrutiny of the agency will continue. The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing Tuesday featuring representatives from conservative groups that were targeted by the IRS. As ABC News' \"The Note\" reports, some of those groups filed a joint lawsuit against the agency last week.\n\nLater in the week, the Inspector General will appear before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to discuss his audit of IRS spending on employee gatherings. Material from the Associated Press was used in compiling this report.",
    " Title: U.S. Embassy in Baghdad Under Siege by Iraqi Protesters, Airstrikes in Iraq and Syria Follow\n\nArticle:\n\nCrowds of Iraqi protesters, some reportedly wearing militia uniforms, stormed the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Tuesday, prompting U.S. guards to fire tear gas in response. The protesters set up tents outside the embassy, intending to stage a sit-in \"until American troops leave Iraq and the embassy is closed.\"\n\nThe embassy attack followed deadly U.S. airstrikes on Sunday that killed 25 fighters of the Iran-backed group, Kataeb Hezbollah. The U.S. military said the airstrikes were in retaliation for last week's killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, which the U.S. blamed on the militia.\n\nMilitary jet fighters conducted \"precision defensive strikes\" on five sites belonging to Kataeb Hezbollah, according to Jonathan Hoffman, a spokesperson for the Pentagon. Two defense officials added that Air Force F-15 jet fighters carried out the strikes.\n\nAs of Tuesday night, about 100 Marines were being sent to the embassy to bolster security, and an Army Apache helicopter flew over the premises and dropped flares in a \"show of force\" to disperse the crowd.\n\nDozens of protesters came within 200 yards of the embassy after busting through an entrance used by cars. The mob shouted \"Down, Down USA!\" as they hurled water and stones over the embassy's walls. They raised yellow militia flags and taunted the embassy's security staff who remained behind the glass windows in the gates' reception area. The mob also sprayed red graffiti on the wall and windows, in support of the Kataeb Hezbollah, reading: \"Closed in the name of the resistance.\"\n\nNo one was immediately reported hurt in the rampage, and security staff withdrew inside the embassy when protesters started to gather outside. The embassy, on its Facebook page, urged American citizens not to approach the compound and \"to review their personal security and emergency preparedness.\"\n\nU.S. officials have stated that the U.S. ambassador and staff were not evacuated, despite initial reports suggesting otherwise. A State Department spokesperson later told Fox News that \"U.S. personnel are secure.\" Secretary of Defense Mark Esper added, \"We have taken appropriate force protection actions to ensure the safety of American citizens, military personnel, and diplomats in country, and to ensure our right of self-defense. We are sending additional forces to support our personnel at the Embassy.\"\n\nAs tempers rose, the mob also set fire to three trailers used by security guards along the embassy wall. Iraq's interior minister, Yassine al-Yasseri, appeared outside the embassy at one point and walked around to inspect the scene. He told the Associated Press that the prime minister had warned the U.S. strikes on the Shiite militiamen would have serious consequences.\n\n\"This is one of the implications,\" al-Yasseri said. \"This is a problem and is embarrassing to the government.\" He added that more security would be deployed to separate the protesters from the embassy, an indication the Iraqi troops would not move in to break up the crowd by force.\n\nSeven armored vehicles with about 30 Iraqi soldiers arrived near the embassy hours after the violence erupted, deploying near the embassy walls but not close to the breached area. Four vehicles carrying riot police approached the embassy later but were forced back by the protesters who blocked their path.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio took to Twitter Tuesday and said Iran was directly responsible for orchestrating the breach. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also stated that Sunday's strikes send the message that the U.S. will not tolerate actions by Iran that jeopardize American lives.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Outlines Four Priorities for First 100 Days as President\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the run-up to the American presidential election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has outlined her four priorities for her first 100 days in office. The following are the key issues she intends to address:\n\n1. Job Creation and Infrastructure Investment: Clinton plans to invest in infrastructure and manufacturing to stimulate economic growth. This investment will focus on renewable energy, with the goal of powering every home in America within a decade. Additionally, she aims to cut red tape for small businesses and make it easier for entrepreneurs to secure credit. The funding for these initiatives will come from increased taxes on the wealthy, Wall Street, and large corporations.\n\n2. Comprehensive Immigration Reform: Clinton intends to work with Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, similar to the legislation signed by President Ronald Reagan. The proposed reform will keep families together, create a path to citizenship, secure the border, and focus enforcement resources on violent criminals.\n\n3. Campaign Finance Reform: Within her first 30 days in office, Clinton plans to introduce a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United decision, which allows corporations to donate to political campaigns. She believes that this move will protect citizens' right to vote and not allow corporations to buy elections.\n\n4. Criminal Justice Reform: Clinton is committed to addressing the issue of mass incarceration by reforming the criminal justice system. She believes that the country will be stronger and safer when everyone respects the law and is respected by the law.\n\nClinton emphasizes that these priorities are not exhaustive and that there is much more work to be done. She aims to work with Americans of all political affiliations, races, and backgrounds to achieve these goals.\n\nClinton's opponent, Donald Trump, has run a divisive campaign, according to Clinton. She encourages voters to consider the kind of change they want for the country, emphasizing that the election is not just about the candidates but about the values and direction of the nation.",
    " Title: House Intelligence Committee Launches Second Phase of Probe into Origins of Anti-Trump Dossier\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, led by Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), has initiated \"Phase 2\" of its investigation into the origins of the unverified anti-Trump dossier. In a letter obtained by Fox News, Nunes posed a series of dossier-related questions to current and former intelligence, law enforcement, and State Department officials.\n\nThe Feb. 20-dated letter, which threatens subpoenas if answers are not provided voluntarily, seeks information on when the officials learned the document was funded by Democratic sources and how it was used to obtain one or more surveillance warrants at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\nNunes, with cooperation from the White House, earlier this month released a controversial memo alleging the anti-Trump dossier, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele and funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign, was crucial in the application for a surveillance warrant against Trump associate Carter Page.\n\nThe new letter includes a dozen questions about the dossier, including how the officials in question learned of the document's Democratic funding and whether they held meetings about the unverified allegations against Trump or took any other official action. Fox News understands the questionnaire went out to about two dozen current and former officials.\n\nAmong them were former FBI Director James Comey, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and former CIA Director John Brennan, who testified in May 2017 that the Trump dossier was virtually unknown to him.\n\nThe newly released GOP memo states that the FBI and Justice Department relied heavily on the Trump dossier and downplayed its Democratic roots. A source close to the investigation is not ruling out the possibility that more officials could be questioned as the next phase of the probe continues.\n\nPerhaps anticipating this phase of the investigation, an Obama State Department official earlier this month acknowledged he had regular contact with the dossier's author. In a Washington Post column, Jonathan Winer detailed an extensive exchange of documents with Steele, a friend of his since 2009. He said he shared \"more than 100 of Steele's reports with the Russia experts at the State Department\" over a period of two years. These weren't related to American politics \u2013 but he would later share information about the Trump dossier with the top levels of the Obama State Department.\n\nFurther, Winer said he shared separate Trump-related material passed on by a Clinton contact with Steele. And he acknowledged that material, originally from Clinton-tied activist/journalist Cody Shearer, made its way to the FBI. In publishing his Op-Ed, Winer wrote that he suspects Nunes wants to know about his own relationship with Steele while at the Obama State Department.\n\nA spokesman for the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, said the California lawmaker was unavailable for an interview.",
    " Title: Tulsa Rally Attendances Low: Implications for Trump's Reelection Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday saw significantly lower attendance than anticipated, with approximately 6,200 people attending, despite claims of over a million ticket requests. The event, intended to reignite his reelection campaign, was marred by empty seats and an unused second stage.\n\nVarious explanations have been proposed for the low turnout. The president's campaign attributed the low numbers to protesters blocking supporters from entering the arena, a claim refuted by reporters on the ground. Reports also suggest that some TikTok users, with no intention of attending, reserved tickets. Health concerns due to the ongoing pandemic may also have contributed to the low attendance.\n\nThe event's impact on Trump's reelection prospects is a subject of debate. Some observers view the low turnout in a state Trump won by 36 points in 2016 as a sign of eroding enthusiasm among his base supporters. With the public disapproving of Trump's handling of the pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests, Joe Biden has built a lead in national and swing state polls. The Tulsa event could have been an opportunity to reverse this trend, but instead, it may have reinforced the narrative of a campaign in crisis, some political analysts argue.\n\nCritics and allies alike agree that the rally was a letdown. However, there is significant disagreement over its implications for Trump's reelection chances. Some argue that the small crowd size indicates a shrinking base of devoted supporters, while others caution against drawing too many conclusions from a single event, especially during uncertain times.\n\nThe content of Trump's speech has also been a point of contention. The speech's focus on his walking awkwardly down a ramp and his claim of advising his coronavirus task force to \"slow the testing down\" to keep the number of positive cases lower has drawn criticism. Some argue that the speech lacked a clear case for why voters should want him in office for another four years.\n\nElections, it is argued, are not determined by rally crowd sizes. Concern over the virus may have kept many Trump supporters from attending the rally, but it may not have the same impact on Election Day. Trump's reelection chances will hinge on his ability to manage the economic, public health, and social crises currently gripping the country, some experts argue. If he is able to do so effectively, a poorly attended rally months before the election will likely be mostly forgotten.\n\nTrump held small campaign events in Arizona focused on border security on Tuesday. His campaign is planning upcoming rallies in Florida, Texas, and North Carolina, with dates yet to be set.\n\nQuotes:\n\n- Jonathan Allen, NBC News: \"To explain how he might be able to win despite poor polling numbers \u2014 and amid national crises \u2014 he has posited that a \u2018 silent majority \u2019 of Americans backs him. But the poor turnout suggests just the opposite \u2014 that enthusiasm for him is weaker than it appears.\"\n- Kevin Liptak and Kaitlan Collins, CNN: \"Once viewed inside the White House and Trump\u2019s campaign as a reset button for a presidency beset by crises and self-inflicted wounds, Saturday evening\u2019s campaign rally in Tulsa instead became plagued with pitfalls, a disappointing microcosm of the blindspots, denial, and wishful thinking that have come to guide the president as he enters one of the most precarious moments of his first term.\"",
    " Title: John Kerry Holds First Calls as Secretary of State with Leaders from Israel, Palestine, and Other Countries\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his first weekend as the 68th U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry spoke with leaders from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Mexico, and Canada. The conversations, detailed in a readout released by the State Department on Sunday, covered various international issues, including the Middle East peace process, terrorist attacks, and the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nKerry's first call was with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussing the recent Israeli elections and the Middle East peace process. He also spoke with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas about Israeli-Palestinian relations and pledged to continue efforts with Congress to send funds to the authority.\n\nThe following day, Kerry spoke with Israeli President Shimon Peres, whom he has known since he was a freshman senator. On Sunday, he conversed with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan.\n\nKerry also spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu on Saturday, discussing Friday's terrorist attack on the perimeter of the U.S. Embassy in Ankara. Davutoglu updated Kerry on the investigation of the suicide bomber who killed himself and one other. The bomber was identified by Istanbul police as Ecevit Sanli, a member of the Marxist Leninist organization known as the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party, or DHKP-C, which the U.S. government and others label a terrorist organization.\n\nKerry and Davutoglu also discussed the violent unrest in Syria and broader Middle East issues. On Saturday, Kerry spoke with Mexican Foreign Secretary Jose Meade, expressing condolences for those killed and injured in Thursday's explosion at the offices of the state oil company, Pemex, in Mexico City. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto posted on Twitter Sunday afternoon that a 35th body had been found.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister John Baird was also on the list of phone calls Saturday. They agreed to stay in touch on the Keystone XL pipeline, which would extend from Canada's tar sands down to the Gulf of Mexico. Construction on the southern portion of the pipeline has already begun, while the northern leg in the United States awaits approval.\n\nKerry had a discussion Saturday with former Secretary of State George Shultz, who served under President Ronald Reagan. According to State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, Kerry has now met with or spoken by phone with each living secretary of state.\n\nThese conversations took place after President Barack Obama announced Kerry as his nominee on December 21.",
    " Title: Republicans Slightly Favorable in Senate Takeover Bid, According to New York Times Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest nonpartisan polling, including a YouGov online panel published on Sunday, indicates that the Republican Party has a 60% chance of capturing the six seats needed to regain control of the U.S. Senate, according to The New York Times. The most likely outcome, as per the Times' forecasting model, is a Republican gain of six seats, which would result in a 51-to-49-seat majority. However, the Times notes that a gain of anywhere from four to eight seats is also possible.\n\nThe Times' model takes into account surveys, fundraising data, and other factors such as candidates' political experience, a state's past election results, and national polling, with varying weights assigned to each factor based on the races being analyzed.\n\nThe YouGov poll suggests that the Republicans have made gains in Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina, but these shifts are offset by positive numbers for the Democrats in Colorado and Alaska, according to the Times. In addition, the Republicans have a slight lead in Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, Iowa, and Michigan, according to the highest quality data, as per the Times. However, the Republican advantage in these states is not significant, suggesting that the races remain competitive.\n\nThe Times emphasizes the importance of polling techniques in the accuracy of predictions. Most polls still use traditional random-digit dialing to reach a sample of people by phone, but declining response rates are leading to less accurate predictions. Young voters and nonwhite voters, who are least likely to own a landline or respond to telephone pollsters, are underrepresented in these polls, leading to inaccurate predictions.\n\nThe YouGov survey, being the first set of data from an online panel this year, is likely to be more accurate than traditional methods, according to the Times. The Times concludes, \"Republicans appear to have narrow leads in enough states to win the Senate, but only narrow leads.\"",
    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie Calls Special Senate Election Amidst Political Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie's decision to call a special election on October 16 to fill the vacant Senate seat left by the late Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg has sparked political speculation. The move, according to Christie, was primarily driven by the need for immediate representation in the U.S. Senate.\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday, Christie emphasized the importance of having a representative in the Senate, stating, \"The citizens of New Jersey need to have an elected representative to the U.S. Senate, and have it as soon as possible.\"\n\nHowever, some critics argue that Christie's decision was strategically motivated, aiming to secure a larger margin in his re-election bid in November. The theory suggests that by scheduling the special and general elections on separate dates, Christie hoped to minimize the potential impact of Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democratic candidate for the Senate seat, on the November election.\n\nThe separate elections will reportedly cost New Jersey taxpayers approximately $12 million more than if both elections were held on the same day. In response to these costs, Christie stated, \"The cost associated with having a special primary and general election, in my mind, can not be measured against the value of having an elected representative in the United States Senate when so many consequential issues are being debated and determined this year.\"\n\nDespite some skepticism, Christie's explanation for the decision has been met with a degree of plausibility. The governor is running for a second term and is rumored to have White House ambitions. However, the political implications of the decision remain a topic of discussion among political analysts and the public.",
    " Title: Obama and Xi Agree on Cyberattacks and South China Sea, but Challenges Remain\n\nArticle:\n\nPresidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping of the United States and China, respectively, have agreed on two of the most contentious issues during their summit in Washington: alleged Chinese cyberattacks on U.S. entities and China's island-building in the South China Sea. The commitments from Beijing have temporarily staved off the threat of U.S. sanctions on Chinese entities over cyberattacks and robust military action around China's artificial islands.\n\nPresident Xi's words need to be followed by swift Chinese actions, U.S. officials cautioned, as President Xi headed to New York to attend U.N. meetings for the final three days of his weeklong U.S. visit. The first state visit to the U.S. by President Xi has been overshadowed by mounting U.S. concerns on these two issues, as well as China's handling of an economic slowdown and its commitment to open its market further to U.S. firms.\n\nPresident Obama directly accused Beijing of engaging in cybertheft from U.S. companies, stating at the joint news conference, \"It has to stop.\" President Xi denied China's involvement in the theft of commercial secrets or other hacking and said the proper approach was to strengthen cooperation to avoid confrontations and not to politicize the issue.\n\nThe U.S. and China announced an agreement not to direct or support cyberattacks that steal corporate records for economic benefit, likely staving off the immediate prospect of U.S. sanctions. However, it wasn't clear how effective the measures would be. \"The question now is, are words followed by action?\" said President Obama. \"We will be watching carefully as to make an assessment as to whether progress has been made in this area.\"\n\nU.S. officials reacted with similar caution to President Xi's apparent commitment for the first time not to \"militarize\" the islands Beijing has been building in the South China Sea, where several of China's neighbors have conflicting territorial claims. President Obama had pressed President Xi to freeze island-building in the Spratly chain, which has raised concern in the U.S. and among its allies about Beijing's military ambitions.\n\nAt the news conference, President Xi repeated China's long-standing position that it has had sovereignty over the South China Sea islands \"since ancient times.\" President Xi added, \"Relevant construction activities that China is undertaking in the [Spratly] islands do not target or impact any country and China does not intend to pursue militarization.\"\n\nA senior U.S. administration official said President Xi's commitment was new, although it sounded similar to statements made by lower-level officials to Secretary of State John Kerry over the summer. \"It is new language,\" said Bonnie Glaser, an expert on the Chinese military at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Unclear what he means by militarization, however. Hopefully, there's some detail. No fighters using the airstrips? No deployment of missiles?\"\n\nSatellite imagery released Friday showed that China had recently completed a runway on one of its artificial islands, which could allow it to accelerate construction and begin air patrols in the area, according to IHS Jane's Defence Weekly. China has said in recent months that its new facilities on the islands are designed to improve living conditions, marine safety, and weather monitoring, but would also be used for military purposes.\n\nU.S. officials say China's facilities could be used to enforce territorial claims in the area and to establish an air defense identification zone over much of the South China Sea. President Obama voiced concern over the issue, saying China is \"now a powerhouse and that means it's got responsibilities\" to help uphold international rules. \"That's part of the deal of being on the world stage when you're a big country...You've got more to do,\" he said.\n\nOutside the White House were hundreds of demonstrators, about half supporters of President Xi and the rest detractors calling on the U.S. president to raise human rights concerns with his Chinese counterpart. President Xi's supporters wore red shirts with a bald eagle and a panda holding up peace signs that said \"China, U.S.A. partner to win-win,\" a phrase adopted from the Chinese leader's words. The protesters included a group seeking independence from China for Tibet and another speaking out against President Xi's treatment of Uighurs in northwestern China. Their roars were audible during the televised news conference.\n\nBefore appearing in the Rose Garden, the two leaders rolled out a stack of agreements, including the cyber measure and a climate-change pledge from Beijing to cap some emissions and put a price on carbon. The two sides also made progress this week toward what could someday be a far-ranging trade and investment agreement that would open up closed sectors of China's economy, U.S. officials said. In talks connected with President Xi's visit, senior U.S. officials said they were able to get China to shrink the list of sectors it is seeking to exclude from the framework, known as a bilateral investment treaty. The U.S. and China have held intense negotiations over cybersecurity measures after a series of computer breaches the White House has blamed on Beijing. U.S. officials have prepared economic sanctions against Chinese companies they believe benefited from information stolen as part of the cyberattacks, but have held off on implementing them. Moments after he welcomed President Xi to the White House, President Obama pledged to \"candidly\" address issues on which he and his Chinese counterpart disagree. President Xi, who was treated to a formal arrival ceremony that included military honor guards and a 21-gun salute, said the U.S. and China are building a new model for major country relations and called for the pursuit of \"win-win cooperation.\" Some critics said President Obama should not have given President Xi the honors of a state visit, given U.S. concerns about China's economic policies and allegations that Chinese hackers have stolen sensitive data from American corporations. But the White House hoped that engaging President Xi, rather than shunning him, would yield cooperation on cybersecurity and reassurances that China is committed to its promised economic reforms. Messrs. Obama and Xi began their discussions Thursday night with a private dinner at the Blair House, the presidential guest residence across from the White House, lasting 2 1/2 hours. President Xi was due to leave Washington after a state banquet on Friday evening and fly to New York, where he will attend meetings on sustainable development and women's rights, before addressing the U.N. General Assembly on Monday.",
    " Title: U.S. Issues Waivers for Iran Nuclear Sanctions on Adoption Day\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has issued waivers for Iran nuclear sanctions on Sunday, marking what is being called \"adoption day\" for the international agreement aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear program. The move comes 90 days after the United Nations Security Council approved the agreement.\n\nPresident Obama signed a presidential memorandum on Sunday, directing his administration to begin issuing waivers to Iran nuclear sanctions. However, the waivers will only go into effect once Iran meets its obligations under the agreement.\n\nThe agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), requires the U.S. and the European Union to direct the issuance of waivers on adoption day. The waivers allow businesses to know what sanctions are being waived, even though they won't go into effect for months.\n\nUnder the agreement, implementation will come only when the International Atomic Energy Agency certifies that Iran has lived up to its obligations to reduce its stockpiles of enriched uranium, dismantle two-thirds of its centrifuges, and halt construction of new nuclear facilities. Western officials have said they expect this to take four to six months.\n\nMost of the sanctions being lifted apply only to non-U.S. citizens and companies doing business with Iran. Most sanctions will still apply to U.S. citizens under separate sanctions imposed on Iran for its support of terrorism and human rights violations. But sales of civilian passenger aircraft and handicrafts\u2014most notably carpets\u2014will be allowed.\n\nThe sanctions against Iran are authorized by Congress but implemented via executive order. Obama can waive those executive orders after Democrats in the Senate filibustered a resolution that would have blocked the agreement last month.\n\nThe adoption day comes amid renewed tensions with Iran over its involvement in Syria's civil war and its October 10 test launch of a ballistic missile, reportedly capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. However, President Obama maintained that these issues are separate from the more urgent need to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nIn Munich on Saturday, a top Iranian military official said Iran was eager to cooperate with international inspectors and would implement the agreement with \"utmost prudence.\"",
    " Title: Mueller's Reported Questions for President Trump Detail Investigative Focus\n\nArticle:\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly seeking to question President Donald Trump on a range of topics, as outlined in a list of inquiries obtained by The New York Times. The questions provide insight into Mueller's areas of investigation and their potential connection to the president.\n\nThe questions cover potential ties between Trump campaign associates and the Russian government, as well as possible attempts to obstruct justice by the president. The list includes queries related to Michael Flynn, Trump's knowledge of his contacts with the Russian ambassador, and whether Trump offered a possible pardon to his former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.\n\nOther questions delve into Trump's motivations behind the firing of FBI Director James Comey, the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, and Trump's contacts with Roger Stone. The list also includes questions about the purpose of Trump's Jan. 27, 2017, dinner with then-FBI Director Comey and what was discussed during that meeting.\n\nAccording to The Times, Mueller's team presented the list of questions to Trump's legal team as part of negotiations to secure a sit-down interview with the president. The president's lawyers transcribed the questions, which The Times obtained from a person outside Trump's legal team.\n\nMueller has reportedly been pushing to interview the president directly, a move that Trump's lawyers have expressed concern over due to the president's tendency towards exaggeration and lying. Trump's top personal lawyer, John Dowd, resigned in March, following reports that Trump was unwilling to heed legal advice, including about sitting for a Mueller interview. Rudy Giuliani, a former prosecutor, New York City mayor, and Trump confidant, was brought onto the president's legal team in April and is reportedly deciding whether a Mueller interview will proceed.\n\nFor the full list of Mueller questions, readers can refer to The Times' exclusive report.",
    " Title: Clinton's Delegate Lead Grows as Sanders' Path to Nomination Narrows\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Bernie Sanders' victories in the Kansas and Nebraska caucuses seemed to revive his flagging campaign, Hillary Clinton's delegate lead continued to grow. Hours before the results were declared on Saturday, the Clinton campaign announced that its pledged delegate lead had grown to 199, a figure larger than Barack Obama's highest margin during the 2008 primary and a significant advantage that makes it difficult for Sanders to catch up.\n\nClinton's delegate lead increased further with her victory in the Louisiana primary, even as Sanders prepared to add another small caucus state to his column. Maine, which votes on Sunday, is expected to support Sanders as well.\n\nClinton's campaign has yet to call for Sanders to suspend his campaign as his path to the nomination narrows. However, since Clinton's resounding victory in South Carolina late last month, the campaign has emphasized the delegate math, hoping the deficit will make the argument itself.\n\nSanders' campaign has argued that his continued participation in the process will boost Democratic voter turnout and keep Clinton in the news, an alternative to ceding months of headlines to Donald Trump and the fractured Republican Party. Bernie Sanders' senior strategist, Tad Devine, cited exit polls from Massachusetts, a Super Tuesday state Clinton won, that showed 17 percent of voters were new to the process and overwhelmingly supported Sanders.\n\nDemocratic turnout could be a time bomb for the party, with about 3 million fewer Democrats voting in the 15 states that held primaries or caucuses through March 1 than in 2008. Meanwhile, Trump's candidacy has turned out droves of new voters.\n\n\"It's important to vigorously contest these contests, and Bernie Sanders is capable of bringing millions of new people into the process,\" said Sanders' senior strategist Tad Devine. \"If Bernie can turn out voters all across America, that's very important for the nominee; it's important for Democrats up and down the ballot. If not, you cede the ground to the opposition in the months ahead, and they're putting on quite a show. If you look at John McCain in 2008, you can see that argument makes a lot of sense.\"\n\nIn 2008, Devine seemed to make a different argument about the value of an extended primary. In an appearance on \"Hardball\" with Chris Matthews that year, he said of the raging primary battle between Clinton and Obama: \"if this race degenerates, it will hurt who the nominee is.\"\n\nThe constructiveness of the rest of the primary remains a question for Clinton. \"As long as she is winning, and as long as she isn't forced to constantly try and maneuver to the left of Bernie Sanders,\" it's not a bad thing for Sanders to remain in the race, said former Mitt Romney strategist Kevin Madden. \"That's the biggest risk that Bernie Sanders has posed and could continue to pose, which is that a number of times during this campaign, Hillary Clinton has been forced to abandon the centrist Clinton brand to try and out-liberal an avowed socialist.\"\n\nLeading into the weekend, Sanders was still playing offense, releasing the transcript of a speech Clinton delivered in India as secretary of state, discussing the benefits of outsourcing jobs abroad, just before Clinton's big jobs speech in Detroit on Friday.\n\nSo far, Clinton's campaign has interpreted many of Sanders' attacks as a stealth campaign to raise questions about her authenticity and character. However, other progressives agreed that a tussle over the issues would be positive for Clinton. \"Democrats could go dark for weeks as Donald Trump gets tons of election night airtime with the 'winner' label attributed to him over and over again, uninterrupted,\" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.\n\nSteve Schmidt, who served as chief strategist for McCain's failed 2008 bid, disagreed with Devine's argument that the prolonged Democratic battle hurts the Republican nominee. \"There are two finite commodities on a political campaign\u2014time and money,\" Schmidt said. \"The more time you have, the more money you can raise. The notion that you are better off in being delayed in being able to turn to the general election is wrong.\" The spring months, he said, would be better used building the billion-dollar organizing infrastructure needed to hone a general election message and win in November.\n\nSome Republican operatives also expected between 35 percent and 40 percent of the GOP electorate to walk on Trump, if he becomes the party's nominee. And Clinton needs to move to the middle to begin reaching out to those voters and convincing them: We agree on more than you think.\n\nIn recent weeks, Clinton ally and Correct the Record founder David Brock has been pushing the idea within Clinton circles that the trend lines in the Republican race present a big opportunity for a GOP crossover vote for Clinton\u2014and that there should be an organized effort to help make that happen. Last week, for instance, former Republican New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said she would support Clinton over Trump, a move that is expected to be a gateway for other Republican voters to follow suit.\n\nHowever, with Clinton stuck in a battle against Sanders\u2014she faces him in a debate Sunday night in Flint, Michigan, and will debate him again Wednesday in Miami\u2014it's harder to begin making the pivot. \"Sen. Sanders remaining in the race allows his anti-Wall Street, anti-elite rhetoric to target Clinton constantly,\" said Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf. \"Bernie Sanders helps Trump, the angry populist, every day he remains a candidate.\"",
    " Title: Media's Ongoing Allegations Against President Trump: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe media landscape, particularly on networks like MSNBC, has been filled with recurring criticisms of President Donald Trump, often without substantial evidence or factual basis. These discussions, more akin to prosecutorial monologues, have not progressed beyond allegations such as Trump's presidency being a get-rich scheme and his interest in the position being driven by greed.\n\nMSNBC's Joe Scarborough, whose maturity level has been compared to a high school cheerleader, has suggested that Trump's involvement in politics was a get-rich scheme, with recent media narratives involving Russian innuendo supporting this claim. However, these claims do not provide concrete evidence of such a scheme.\n\nRecurring stories about minor figures associated with Trump, such as Carter Page, have generated headlines about potential connections to Russia, but offer little in the way of substantive information or reasons for the media's interest.\n\nThe media's persistent focus on these minor figures and their alleged connections to Trump is seen as a result of partisan spite rather than genuine concern for fact-finding. The term \"associates\" is used imprecisely, and the alleged links are often tenuous at best.\n\nThe media's repeated claims of Trump's collusion with Russian President Vladimir Putin to defeat Hillary Clinton are widely known to be unfounded. However, they continue to perpetuate the myth in the hopes that it will become ingrained in the minds of Americans.\n\nSimilarly, the media seeks to portray Trump as a racist, a characterization that began in the early days of his campaign due to deliberate misrepresentations of his comments about illegal immigrants.\n\nThe media's willful construction of anti-Trump narratives is exemplified by their interruptions of Trump's speeches to inform viewers that the president is lying. This approach is not only questionable in its accuracy but also raises concerns about the media's role in shaping public opinion.\n\nWhat is particularly concerning is the role that rattled or envious Republicans have played in the construction of these anti-Trump narratives. Even members of Trump's own staff have contributed to these narratives, such as Gary Cohn, who gave an interview that did not reference Trump's explicit and repeated condemnations of racists, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists.\n\nIn essence, the media's relentless pursuit of anti-Trump narratives, regardless of their veracity, raises questions about the credibility of the information they present and their role in shaping public opinion.",
    " Title: Republican Primary Strategy Faces Challenges as Trump Remains Frontrunner\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, the Republican primary race is proving to be a challenging endeavor for those aiming to derail Donald Trump's bid for the party's nomination. The party's decision to frontload this year's primaries and caucuses has left only a fraction of the total delegates allocated, with 1,537 of 2,472 delegates already claimed following Super Tuesday.\n\nThe issue at hand is that, for the first time in modern GOP history, the insurgent candidate, in this case, Trump, has become the frontrunner. With only 15 states having allocated delegates, and another 15 set to vote by March 22, the anti-Trump forces are running out of opportunities to change the GOP narrative.\n\nOne proposed solution to beating Trump is through a head-to-head contest. However, this notion should be taken with a grain of salt, as recent polls suggest that Trump would still emerge victorious in such scenarios. For instance, in a hypothetical matchup between Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump would win by six points in the former case and 13 points in the latter, according to the latest NBC News/SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Poll.\n\nAnother strategy is to keep Trump from exceeding 50% in each state, as the number of delegates needed to secure the nomination (1,237) is the most crucial factor, rather than the number of states won. Of the remaining 1,744 Republican delegates, 391 are in winner-take-all states, with Florida and Ohio, on March 15, being the most important. Trump must be stopped in one, if not both, of these states to slow down his momentum.\n\nIn the remaining proportional states, Trump's ceiling of around 30% could still allow anti-Trump forces to catch up, provided they can win a significant number of delegates. Wisconsin's April 5 primary, Indiana's May 3 primary, and California and New Jersey's June 7 primary are crucial states to watch.\n\nIf Trump goes into the Republican National Convention close but short of a first-ballot victory, the convention could become a battleground for delegates willing to switch their support to another candidate. The GOP's 437 \"pledged\" delegates, including 269 Republican officeholders and 168 members of the Republican National Committee, would be key targets for anti-Trump forces.\n\nIn the end, the Republican primary race remains a complex and challenging endeavor, with Trump's momentum and the limited number of remaining delegates making it a daunting task for those aiming to derail his bid for the nomination. The race will likely come down to a combination of strategic maneuvers, grassroots mobilization, and a bit of luck.",
    " Title: FBI Investigation and Email Controversy Impact on U.S. Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States presidential election approaches, pollsters and observers are expressing concerns about the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, losing support while Republican nominee Donald Trump experiences a resurgence. A week ago, Clinton held a significant lead in the polls following a series of gaffes by Trump. However, the FBI's recent intervention regarding Clinton's use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state, along with the release of damaging emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, has caused a shift in the polls.\n\nThe FBI's letter to congressional officials, penned by Director James Comey, came at a challenging time for Clinton. With only a week remaining until the election, it is difficult to prove a negative and re-establish Clinton's innocence. The letter followed a series of news events that had already made a significant dent in Clinton's polling lead.\n\nThe release of emails to and from Podesta, obtained by WikiLeaks and allegedly from Russian hackers, has been trickling out for weeks. While the content has been mostly embarrassing rather than damaging, Wednesday's release of a report that appeared to confirm the Clinton family's blurring of business, charitable, and political interests provided Trump supporters with fresh ammunition during a time when they were desperate to shift attention from their candidate's own scandals.\n\nIn an election described as an unpopularity contest, small shifts in opinion can significantly impact independent voters. By Friday, the combination of no news from Trump and bad news from Clinton had halved Clinton's average lead in the polls since the last presidential debate.\n\nPolitical consultant Frank Luntz predicted that the winner of the 2016 election will be the campaign that keeps the focus on its opponent. Sunday's average lead for Clinton in national polls of 3.4% remains a healthy safety margin, but it is smaller than Clinton's lead in the final days of the 1992 election, which she won by nearly double that margin.\n\nHowever, few polls have been conducted since the news broke about the FBI and the emails. One reputable survey, an ABC News-Washington Post tracking poll released on Sunday, showed just a one-point overall lead for Clinton. The poll found that the news had mostly hardened existing opinions but could also play a role at the margins.\n\nThe potential for a pullback in motivation among Clinton supporters or a further resurgence among Trump's supporters may cause concern in the Clinton camp, especially because this dynamic was already underway. Intention to vote has grown in Trump support groups in the past week as the intensity of criticisms about him has ebbed.\n\nA poll of voters in 13 battleground states showed that only 5% of Democrats said the issue might make them less likely to support Clinton, compared with more than a quarter of registered Republicans. This risk also helps explain the ferocity of Democratic calls for the FBI to urgently exonerate Clinton.\n\nMany loyalists are convinced the latest trove of emails, discovered on equipment shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner, are an irrelevance. However, so long as this is not categorically established, there may be a nagging doubt in some minds that the FBI suspects otherwise. Not everyone will be prepared to give Clinton the benefit of the doubt. Some studies have shown that only 11% of voters describe Clinton as \"honest and trustworthy,\" lower even than Trump's score of 16%.\n\nWhile it may not be enough to tip the balance, running for president while facing potential criminal investigation is never a good look.",
    " Title: The National Debt and Entitlement Programs: A Threat to the Republic's Sustainability\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States faces a significant challenge in the form of a growing national debt and entitlement programs, which some argue pose a threat to the sustainability of the Republic. This issue, while not new, has gained renewed attention due to the latest White House budget proposal.\n\nThe unveiling of the presidential budget is a ritual in Washington, often perceived as a document of great significance. However, its unveiling is typically nothing more than a symbolic act, with little bearing on the fundamental problems the country faces. The budgetary process often resembles a gladiatorial contest, with various interest groups vying for funding, while the underlying issue of the national debt and entitlement programs remains largely unaddressed.\n\nNon-defense discretionary spending amounts to roughly 16% of the budget. Even if this were to be completely eliminated, it would only delay the fiscal reckoning that would come from the metastasizing growth of the national debt and the entitlement spending that fuels it. In 2008, the federal debt was 39% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Last summer, it was 75% of GDP. According to the Congressional Budget Office, if the current course is maintained, it will reach 86% by 2026 and 141% of GDP by 2046.\n\nWith regard to the president's rumored plan to cut $10.5 trillion over the next ten years, Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute writes, \"Without making changes to our insolvent entitlement programs\u2014Social Security and Medicare alone face some $80 trillion in future red ink\u2014there is simply no way to get anywhere near $10.5 trillion in spending cuts.\" However, neither President Trump nor the Democratic leadership seems inclined to address entitlement reform.\n\nThe causes of Rome's fall are the subject of endless debate, but nearly all historians agree that one of the major factors was the endless accumulation of debt driven by entitlements, largely in the form of land and titles of nobility, given to more and more segments of Roman society. The Caesars and the senators found it too difficult a problem to fix, so they played their ritualistic games until reality had its say.\n\nIn conclusion, the national debt and entitlement programs are a significant challenge facing the United States. Without addressing these issues, the country risks following in the footsteps of empires past, where the rituals that once helped enforce order became distractions from the demands of reality. The real threat to the Republic is not the gladiatorial arenas of talk radio and cable television; it is the barbarian horde of debt and entitlement.",

This PAC, he said, will facilitate conversations with citizens across America to discuss the most critical challenges facing the nation and support leaders, ideas, and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all Americans.\n\nBush previously fell short to Democrat Lawton Chiles in the 1994 elections but was elected governor of Florida in 1998 and served two terms. If successful, he would be the third in his immediate family to serve as Commander-in-Chief, following his father, George H.W. Bush, and his brother, George W. Bush. Bush's son, George P. Bush, was recently elected as Texas' next Land Commissioner.\n\nBush did not specify when he would make a final decision about officially entering the race, but the formation of a leadership PAC has become a new preliminary step for prospective presidential candidates. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, also rumored to be considering a presidential run, formed his own PAC, Reclaim America, after being elected to the Senate in 2010.\n\nIn his note, Bush extended holiday wishes to his followers and expressed hope to visit with many of them in the coming months to discuss restoring the promise of America.

    " Title: Virginia Newspapers Criticize Democratic Candidate's Tactics in Gubernatorial Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days of the Virginia gubernatorial race, the Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, has been criticized by Virginia newspapers for using the Charlottesville tragedy to score political points. The controversy stems from a mailer issued by Northam's campaign, which links his Republican opponent, Ed Gillespie, to white nationalism.\n\nThe mailer, which has been criticized as \"practically libelous\" by the Richmond Times-Dispatch, features a photo of the Charlottesville Tiki-torch marchers and condemns Gillespie for not speaking out against President Trump's \"good people on both sides\" comment made during the Charlottesville rally. However, it is important to note that Gillespie did denounce the white supremacists before the rally took place.\n\nThe Daily Progress, a Charlottesville-based paper, has been particularly critical of Northam's tactics, describing them as \"stomach-turning.\" The paper argues that the mailer politicizes the Charlottesville tragedy, which has already been a contentious issue. The Northam campaign is accused of trying to tie Gillespie to the unpopular president, exploiting the Charlottesville tragedy for political advantage.\n\nThe controversy has sparked criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, with some arguing that it is fair game for Northam's opponent to challenge Gillespie on his endorsement of the Trump agenda. However, the exploitation of the Charlottesville tragedy for political gain is seen as a step too far by many, including The Daily Progress. The paper's criticism highlights the delicate balance between political campaigning and respect for the pain and suffering experienced by the community during the white supremacist invasion in Charlottesville.",
    " Title: Interpretation of Pardon Clause in U.S. Constitution Challenges Presidential Pardon Power in Impeachment Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nA debate has arisen regarding the interpretation of the pardon clause in the United States Constitution, specifically in relation to the president's power to pardon individuals associated with impeachment proceedings. Some argue that the clause also prohibits a president from commuting the sentences of individuals charged with crimes related to impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nThe impeachment of President Donald Trump focused on allegations of withholding foreign aid from Ukraine to pressure the Ukrainian president into investigating his political opponents, and his refusal to cooperate with the congressional investigation into this matter. The articles of impeachment also mentioned his \"previous invitations of foreign interference in United States elections\" and \"previous efforts to undermine United States Government investigations into foreign interference in United States elections.\"\n\nThis interpretation suggests that President Trump could not use the pardon and reprieve power to commute the sentences of those charged with crimes related to Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, including Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress and obstructing its investigation into Russian election interference.\n\nThe argument for this interpretation is rooted in the Constitution's text, history, values, and structure. The Framers were concerned about presidents abusing power to protect co-conspirators, as evidenced by Edmund Randolph's concern at the Constitutional Convention that \"the prerogative of pardon in these cases was too great a trust. The President may himself be guilty. The Traytors may be his own instruments.\"\n\nOn August 25, 1787, delegates voted on the pardon clause. The president was initially granted the power to grant reprieves and pardons, but unanimously voted to insert \"except in cases of impeachment\" after the word pardon. Directly afterward, they rejected the addition of the phrase \"but his pardon shall not be pleadable in bar\" in a six-to-four vote.\n\nThese votes suggest that the Framers saw the new phrase as having a meaning distinct from the traditional interpretation. If \"except in cases of impeachment\" already covered both of those limits on presidential pardons, why would the Framers then need to vote on whether to include the British phrase, language that would have merely imposed the first limit they had already unanimously approved?\n\nGiven the unclear record of what the Framers meant to do that day, any interpretation of its meaning based only on the evidence we have about the day the phrase was adopted is speculative at best. However, this interpretation provides a compelling argument for limiting the president's pardon power in impeachment cases.",
    " Title: Washington Navy Yard Shooting: A Call for Caution and Reflection\n\nArticle:\n\nMonday morning saw the latest in a series of shooting incidents in the United States, with at least one gunman reportedly killing 12 people and wounding several others at the Washington Navy Yard. The incident, while still under investigation, serves as a grim reminder of the prevalence of gun violence in the country.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., area, like many other parts of the U.S., is not immune to such incidents. Individual shootings occur frequently, but a mass shooting, as in the case of the Washington Navy Yard, is a particularly violent and disruptive event.\n\nThis article aims to provide an objective account of the incident, avoiding speculation and drawing only on verified information.\n\nThe 2002 \"Beltway sniper\" attacks serve as a stark reminder of the potential for such incidents. Over a 20-day period, two snipers killed 10 people across the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. The motives behind the attacks were unclear, with speculation ranging from terrorism to personal grievances.\n\nThe Washington Navy Yard shooting, like the Beltway sniper attacks, is still in its early stages of investigation. Law enforcement is currently searching for an additional suspect, while a first suspect, identified as Aaron Alexis, was killed at the scene. If the shooting did, in fact, involve multiple shooters, this suggests a level of coordination and deliberation that goes beyond a lone-wolf attack.\n\nHowever, the early reports are contradictory and often incorrect. It is crucial, in the aftermath of such tragedies, to avoid drawing conclusions too early. The rush to be first with the news often results in the dissemination of incorrect information, ultimately harming the public's understanding of the events.\n\nIn these first few hours after the tragedy, it is essential to wait patiently for credible information and to reflect on the broader implications of such incidents. This includes questions about terrorism, mental health, gun control, and public safety.\n\nAs the investigation continues, Americans will mourn those who have passed, the FBI will investigate, and the affected areas will be cleaned. In the meantime, it is crucial to carry on with our days, waiting and reflecting with wisdom rather than fearful speculation.\n\nJoshua Foust, a freelance journalist with a background in counterterrorism and foreign policy, offers insights on these issues.

    " Title: The Case for Using Professional Women as Fashion Role Models\n\nArticle:\n\nThe article discusses the argument for using professional women, such as Hillary Rodham Clinton, Julia Gillard, and Kirsten Gillibrand, as fashion role models, particularly in the context of the modern world where personal appearance plays a significant role, especially in the digital age. The author suggests that these women, who have had to navigate traditionally male-dominated environments, can provide valuable insights into how to manage one's image and appearance in professional and public settings.\n\nThe author argues that using celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence, Nicole Kidman, or Rihanna as fashion role models may not be practical, especially for those over 25 or not involved in pop culture. The author contends that these celebrities, who are often airbrushed and photographed primarily for red carpet events or charity trips, may not be suitable examples for dressing for professional settings such as pitching a new client, negotiating a deal, or teaching.\n\nThe author also mentions that even women who have become fashion icons due to non-celebrity public roles, such as Michelle Obama and the Duchess of Cambridge, are primarily symbolic figures whose dressing is a mode of diplomatic expression. The author questions whether the same rules apply to women with a more palpable professional voice.\n\nThe author suggests that learning from the wardrobe strategies of professional women like Christine Lagarde, Sheryl Sandberg, Indra Nooyi, and Mary Barra could be beneficial. However, the author notes that these women, who dress well, rarely discuss their fashion choices, possibly due to the fear of not being taken seriously. The author argues that the solution is not to ignore the issue but to embrace it and move forward.",
    " Title: Global Warming Ranks Low in UN Survey of 6.7 Million People Worldwide\n\nArticle:\n\nA United Nations survey of 6.7 million people across 194 countries, including the Palestinian territories, has revealed that climate change ranks low in global priorities. The survey, which went online in March, found that education was the most important issue, while climate change ranked below access to telephones and the Internet.\n\nThe survey results were consistent across gender, age groups, and education levels. In the United States, climate change was ranked as the 10th most important issue, while in Britain, it was placed at number nine.\n\nWillis Eschenback, a contributor to the website Watts Up With That, which covers news on global warming and climate change, commented on the survey results, stating, \"The revealed truth is that of the sixteen choices given to people regarding what they think are the important issues in their lives, climate change is dead last.\"\n\nMeanwhile, delegates to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, meeting in Lima, Peru, are facing difficulties in reaching a final agreement by the end of the forum on Friday. The Associated Press reported on Sunday that the momentum from a historic U.S.-China pact to combat global warming is showing signs of fading at the U.N. climate talks, with the familiar rich-poor conflict persisting over who should take action to prevent global warming.\n\nThe news service was referring to an agreement reached between U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November, which commits the United States to real cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, while China essentially made another promise to cut pollution. Foreign Policy recently reviewed the agreement and concluded that China offered little in terms of concrete commitments.",
    " Title: White House Blocks Lev Parnas Testimony in Senate Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nLev Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani, exited the Manhattan Federal Court in New York on December 17, 2019, following a bail hearing. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal on Monday, the White House has indicated it will block any attempt to summon Parnas to testify in the Senate impeachment trial.\n\nParnas, who was involved in Giuliani's efforts to investigate Joe Biden, made several claims regarding President Trump's involvement in Ukraine during a series of interviews released on Wednesday. In an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Parnas stated, \"President Trump knew exactly what was going on. He was aware of all my movements. I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the President.\"\n\nParnas accused Attorney General William Barr of being aware of Giuliani's and Trump's actions, but Barr denied having any knowledge of such dealings. In testimony during House impeachment hearings, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch alleged Parnas and associate Igor Fruman, along with Giuliani, were working to oust her to advance Parnas's and Fruman's business interests. The two are also thought to have worked with former top Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko to obtain information on the Bidens.\n\nParnas was indicted in October on campaign-finance charges and is accused of disguising donations to Republican candidates to advance his personal interests and those of other Ukrainian politicians.\n\nPresident Trump's impeachment defense team, which includes heavyweight attorney Alan Dershowitz and former Clinton impeachment manager Ken Starr, announced on Monday it will call on the Senate to \"swiftly reject\" the articles of impeachment. In a trial brief released by the team, it states, \"The Senate should speedily reject these articles of impeachment and acquit the President. All that House Democrats have succeeded in proving is that the President did absolutely nothing wrong.\"\n\nDemocrats allege President Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate corruption allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden.",

On Wednesday, Barr met with Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) ahead of his confirmation hearings, which are scheduled for next week.\n\nDuring the meeting, Graham recounted that he asked Barr directly, \"Do you think Mr. Mueller is on a witch hunt?\" Barr responded, \"No.\" When asked, \"Do you think he would be fair to the president and the country as a whole?\" Barr replied, \"Yes.\" \"And do you see any reason for Mr. Mueller's investigation to be stopped?\" Barr said, \"No.\" \"Do you see any reason for a termination based on cause?\" Barr said, \"No.\" \"Are you committed to making sure Mr. Mueller can finish his job?\" Barr responded, \"Yes.\"\n\nThe news comes as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the investigation, announced he is stepping down after Barr is confirmed. Some Democrats want Barr to recuse himself from the Mueller probe due to his previous statements criticizing the investigation. Specifically, they are referring to a controversial memo Barr wrote last year to Rosenstein, calling the probe \"fatally misconceived.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Wednesday, \"The Senate... should subject Mr. Barr's views to the strictest of scrutiny next week, and I still believe, after the revelations about Mr. Barr's unsolicited memo, President Trump ought to withdraw this nomination.\" Likewise, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said the memo was \"deeply worrisome because in effect he says the president is above the law... that's incorrect as a matter of law, but certainly for an attorney general to have that position is deeply wrong.\"\n\nHowever, Graham says Democrats' fears are unfounded, noting that Barr and Mueller are good friends of more than 20 years, and their wives attend a Bible study together. \"I can assure you he has a very high opinion of Mr. Mueller and he is committed to letting Mr. Mueller finish his job,\" the South Carolina lawmaker said.",
    " Title: John Hinckley Jr., Assassination Attempt Suspect, Granted Freedom After 35 Years\n\nJohn Hinckley Jr., the man who attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981, has been granted freedom by a federal judge in Washington, D.C. The release could occur as early as next week, with Hinckley residing full-time with his elderly mother in Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\nOn March 30, 1981, outside the Washington Hilton Hotel, Hinckley, with shaggy hair, aimed his gun at President Reagan and fired six times. Reagan spent nearly two weeks in the hospital recovering from wounds and blood loss. James Brady, the president's press secretary, was shot in the head. Brady survived but spent the next 28 years in a wheelchair. A court found Hinckley not guilty by reason of insanity a year after the attack.\n\nPresident Reagan's daughter, Patti Davis, expressed her disapproval of the not guilty verdict last year, stating that Hinckley knew right from wrong at the time of the attack. Davis argued that attempting to kill the president is a unique crime, stating, \"You can't say well, if he shot the butcher, it would be different. He did try to shoot a president. We hold that crime in a different category than we do other attempted murders.\"\n\nThe Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute released a statement, stating, \"Contrary to the judge's decision, we believe John Hinckley is still a threat to others and we strongly oppose his release.\"\n\nFor the past decade, Hinckley has been gradually moving towards freedom. Saint Elizabeths Hospital, where he has resided, states that he no longer poses a danger to himself or others. Doctors report that his depression and psychosis are in full remission. In court, his lawyer described a man who plays guitar, goes to movies, and browses in bookstores.\n\nHinckley already spends 17 days each month with his mother in the Kingsmill resort community in Williamsburg, which bothers his neighbor Joe Mann. \"It could be a grave mistake to try to force fit him into that community with his 90-year-old mother,\" Mann told NPR before the ruling. \"What I think of is Hinckley may be OK as long as he is on his drugs. What goes off when he misses a dose or two? Or decides, I don't need this stuff?\"\n\nUnder the terms of the order, Hinckley is not allowed to contact his victims, their relatives, or actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was obsessed. Hinckley also will not be permitted to \"knowingly travel\" to areas where the current president or members of Congress are present. The judge said Hinckley could be allowed to live on his own or in a group home after one year.\n\nHinckley's longtime lawyer, Barry William Levine, argued to the court last year that his client is entitled to live under the least restrictive conditions in keeping with public safety. Levine told NPR in an interview Wednesday that Hinckley is \"profoundly sad and sorry for the pain he caused his victims, their families, and the nation.\"\n\nLevine stated that the voluminous court record demonstrates Hinckley is not a threat to anyone. \"This case shows that people who are ravaged by disease, mental disease, can get well and become productive members of society without imposing any threat of danger,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Justice Department prosecutors have been leery. The prosecutors want to be able to monitor Hinckley's whereabouts and his Internet use. Former prosecutor Thomas Zeno explained why in an interview with NPR a few years ago, stating, \"The question with Mr. Hinckley is because he has this basic character flaw or personality flaw, as it is called, of narcissism, can he really be changed? And will he really be a different person?\"\n\nJohn Hinckley is now 61 years old, and, as the judge wrote, \"suffering from arthritis, high blood pressure, and various other physical ailments like many men his age.\"",

Ajjawi, a 17-year-old Palestinian refugee living in Lebanon, had his visa revoked hours after landing in the U.S. on Friday night. Ajjawi, who intended to study Chemical and Physical Biology, spent a total of eight hours in Boston, Massachusetts, before being deported back to Lebanon.\n\nUpon landing, Ajjawi and several other international students faced questioning from immigration officials. However, Ajjawi was held back while his peers were allowed to proceed. He alleges that an immigration officer continued to question him about his religion and religious practices in Lebanon. That officer then asked the student to unlock his phone and laptop, which were searched for five hours, according to Ajjawi.\n\nThe officer then asked him about his friends' social media activity, stating that they found posts sharing political views that were against the U.S. Ajjawi responded that he had no business with such posts and that he did not like, share, or comment on them, stating that he should not be held responsible for what others post.\n\nDespite his defense, the immigration officer canceled Ajjawi's visa and told him he would be deported. Ajjawi was allowed a phone call to his parents before returning to Lebanon.\n\nAjjawi is now in contact with a lawyer and the university with the hopes of resolving his visa before classes start next Tuesday, September 3. U.S. Customs and Border Protection told the Harvard Crimson that Ajjawi was deemed inadmissible to the country.\n\nHarvard University says they are working closely with the student's family and appropriate authorities to resolve this matter so that he can join his classmates in the coming days. Ajjawi was coming to Harvard on a scholarship given by AMIDEAST, a nonprofit, which is now aiding him with legal assistance.\n\nAjjawi's revoked visa comes after he was highlighted on a local news site, Alaraby Entertainment, for his success story, from being a refugee in Lebanon to getting into the coveted Ivy League school on a full scholarship. His father was also included in that news cast, proudly gushing about his son's success.\n\nAjjawi's friend, Selah Chehade, stated to DailyMail.com, \"Deporting him back is of course an unfair act. He is a very clever student, and it is not appropriate to act with him this way.\"",

The election's outcome, regardless of Romney's victory, will significantly influence the party's approach to governing and campaigning in the future.\n\nEven before the election results are announced, discussions about the reasons for a potential Romney loss are already emerging. If Romney wins, he will become the President of the United States. However, if he loses, he will serve as a symbol of the Republican Party's shortcomings.\n\nOne of the main criticisms of Romney throughout the 2012 race was his perceived ineptitude as a competitor. Republicans were not overly enthusiastic about nominating Romney due to his moderate leanings and his struggles in the 2008 primaries. During the 2012 campaign, Romney was criticized for various missteps, such as his response to the Supreme Court's Affordable Care Act ruling, his comments about the British during the London Olympics, and his remarks about Americans who do not pay income taxes.\n\nOn a deeper level, Romney's close ties to Wall Street, an industry still recovering from the financial crisis, may have made him a vulnerable candidate. Former Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour noted in August that Democrats had successfully branded Romney as a \"wealthy plutocrat married to a known equestrian.\"\n\nThe post-election analysis and self-examination by the Republican Party will provide insights into the party's future direction and campaign strategies. The outcome of the 2012 election will undoubtedly shape the political landscape for years to come.",
    " Title: Deficit Reduction Experts Express Optimism, Yet Warn of Entitlement Challenges in Fiscal Cliff Talks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent appearance on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" two deficit reduction experts discussed the ongoing stalemate in Washington regarding the \"fiscal cliff.\" Despite the lack of progress between President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner on averting year-end spending cuts and tax hikes that could potentially plunge the economy back into recession, former President Clinton's chief of staff Erskine Bowles expressed increased optimism.\n\nBowles, who co-chaired Mr. Obama's fiscal commission in 2010, stated, \"I think we made some progress this week, Bob. I'm more encouraged than I was.\" He attributed this progress to both sides taking positions that differ from their previously hardened stances, with Speaker Boehner showing a willingness to increase taxes and President Obama demonstrating openness to entitlement cuts.\n\nHowever, Bowles noted that the president's proposal to cut around $350 billion from Medicare is \"not enough.\" He emphasized the need for further entitlement reform, stating, \"We simply made promises we can't keep. We've got to face up to it.\"\n\nFormer Senator Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who co-chaired the president's fiscal commission with Bowles and now runs the Fix the Debt campaign, agreed with this assessment. Simpson highlighted the entitlements as the primary drivers of the looming fiscal cliff, stating, \"The entitlements are the engine on the train driving us to the cliff. They were on automatic pilot.\"\n\nSimpson also expressed concern about the rising cost of healthcare and the number of baby boomers aging into entitlement programs, going so far as to dance the \"Gangnam Style\" in a YouTube video to persuade young kids to \"get off your can.\" He noted that if current trends continue, senior groups like the AARP will \"strip the treasury dry in 30 years.\"\n\nBoth Simpson and Bowles advocated for similar positions, with Simpson promoting raising taxes by limiting tax expenditures through tax reform after the New Year, and emphasizing the need for entitlement reform. In 2010, they co-chaired a bipartisan committee that proposed a plan to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years; however, the president did not embrace the plan, and Congress failed to pass it.\n\nBowles warned that going over the \"fiscal cliff\" would result in a four percent slowdown in the economy, with businesses already \"slowing their head count\" and cutting capital expenditures. Simpson criticized Washington lawmakers for playing politics with the \"fiscal cliff,\" stating that such behavior is \"terribly bizarre and juvenile.\"\n\nIn conclusion, while deficit reduction experts like Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson expressed optimism about the ongoing fiscal cliff talks, they also highlighted the significant challenges posed by entitlement programs and the need for comprehensive reform. The stalemate in Washington continues, with the potential for significant economic consequences if a resolution is not reached.",

In an interview with The Post, Bannon expressed concern over the White House's seemingly uncoordinated approach to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News, criticized the performance of Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, citing a disastrous press conference where Mulvaney confirmed Trump's decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine was part of a quid pro quo. Mulvaney later walked back his comments.\n\nBannon suggested that the White House should establish an \"impeachment squad\" to focus on the impeachment inquiry 24/7, bifurcating the White House Counsel's office, as was done during the investigation by Robert Mueller into Russian interference.\n\nIf Trump manages to survive a House impeachment probe, Bannon anticipates potential challenges from surprising and viable candidates in the 2020 election, such as Michael Bloomberg or Hillary Clinton. He expressed dissatisfaction with the current field of Democratic candidates, predicting a total Biden implosion by the end of the year and a centrist revolt against Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIn the event that Biden falters and Warren appears to be marching toward the nomination, Bannon predicted that both Bloomberg and Clinton would enter the race. He described the current Democratic candidates as insufficiently competitive compared to Bloomberg or Clinton.\n\nBannon also suggested that the Democratic nominee would need to focus on states like Arizona, Texas, Georgia, and the Carolinas, which he referred to as Trump's \"southern arc.\" He also emphasized the importance of campaigning in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, states that Clinton neglected in her 2016 race and that turned against the party for the first time in a generation.\n\nSince leaving the White House in 2017, Bannon has been traveling extensively, speaking at conferences, meeting with billionaires, and promoting his vision of populist nationalism. He has also taken a growing interest in China, which he views as the primary threat to the United States. Bannon spoke with The Post shortly after a screening of his new film, \"Claws of the Red Dragon,\" in New York. The movie is a loose retelling of the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Canada last year.",

The allegation is part of a Justice Department inspector general review of the FBI's Russia investigation, a politically sensitive probe that has been one of the most contentious elements of the Russia probe and has shadowed President Donald Trump's presidency since its beginning.\n\nThe allegation against the lawyer was first reported by CNN, and the Washington Post subsequently reported that the conduct of the FBI employee did not alter Horowitz's finding that the surveillance application of Page had a proper legal and factual basis, an official told the Post, which said the lawyer was forced out.\n\nThe inspector general report, centered in part on the use of a secret surveillance warrant to monitor the communications of a former Trump adviser, is likely to revive debate about an investigation that has been a contentious issue since the beginning of Trump's presidency. It will be released amid a House impeachment inquiry into Trump's efforts to press Ukraine's leader to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden at the same time as military aid was being withheld from the country.\n\nTrump and his supporters are likely to seize on any findings of mistakes or bad judgment in the report to support their claims of a biased investigation. Supporters of the FBI, meanwhile, are likely to hold up as vindication any findings that the investigation was done by the book or free of political considerations.\n\nThe FBI obtained a secret surveillance warrant in 2016 to monitor the communications of Page, who was never charged in the Russia investigation or accused of wrongdoing. The warrant, which was renewed several times and approved by different judges in 2016 and early 2017, has been one of the most contentious elements of the Russia probe and was the subject of dueling memos last year issued by Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nRepublicans have long attacked the credibility of the warrant application since it cited information derived from a dossier of opposition research compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy whose work was financed by Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\nCarter Page, in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox's \"Mornings with Maria,\" said, \"They got my warrant \u2014 a fraudulent warrant, I believe \u2014 to spy on myself as a way of getting into the Trump campaign.\" He added, \"There has been a continued cover-up to this day. We still do not have the truth, but hopefully, we'll get that soon.\"\n\nFBI Director Chris Wray has told Congress that he did not consider the FBI surveillance to be \"spying\" and that he has no evidence the FBI illegally monitored Trump's campaign during the 2016 election. Wray said he would not describe the FBI's surveillance as \"spying\" if it \"follows investigative policies and procedures.\"\n\nAttorney General William Barr has said he believed \"spying\" did occur, but he also made clear at a Senate hearing earlier this year that he had no specific evidence that any surveillance was illegal or improper. Barr has appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate how intelligence was collected, and that probe has since become criminal in nature, a person familiar with the matter has said.\n\nHowever, Trump insists that members of the Obama administration \"at the highest levels\" were spying on his 2016 campaign. \"Personally, I think it goes all the way... I think this goes to the highest level,\" he said in the Fox interview. \"I hate to say it. I think it's a disgrace. They thought I was going to win and they said, 'How can we stop him?'\"\n\nSpokespeople for the FBI and the inspector general declined to comment Friday.",

Joe Manchin as Potential Replacement for Interior Secretary\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced via Twitter on Saturday that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke would be leaving the administration at the end of the year. In a series of tweets, the president commended Zinke for his nearly two-year tenure atop the Department of Interior.\n\n\"Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation,\" said Mr. Trump in one of his tweets. The Trump Administration will be announcing the new Secretary of the Interior next week.\n\nOne early name suggested as a replacement is Sen. Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat who recently won re-election. Manchin has had a complex relationship with President Trump, seeking areas to collaborate with the president.\n\nIf selected, Sen. Manchin's confirmation process is expected to be smooth, and one influential strategist stated that Manchin would align with Trump's policies. \"He is going to toe the line,\" the strategist said.\n\nThe departure of Mr. Zinke, who faced numerous ethics investigations and was criticized by environmentalists, is part of a year-end shakeup at the White House. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was cut loose shortly after the November elections, and this month, the president announced that Chief of Staff John Kelly was on his way out. The president has hinted at more staff changes, although he stated that he \"loves\" his Cabinet secretaries for the most part.\n\nMr. Zinke's job has been under stress for months due to the scandals surrounding him. The scandals range from high-priced travel on government planes to an alleged shady land deal in his hometown of Whitefish, Montana, involving the Zinke family and Halliburton chairman David Lesar. The Interior Department inspector general referred the land deal scandal to the Justice Department. Rep. Raul Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who will lead the House Natural Resources Committee next year, has vowed a probe of the land deal.\n\nKier\u00e1n Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, stated, \"Zinke will go down as the worst Interior secretary in history. His slash-and-burn approach was absolutely destructive for public lands and wildlife. Allowing David Bernhardt to continue to call the shots will still be just as ugly.

    " Title: Primary Voting Results Shake Up Democratic and Republican Races\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest round of primary voting has brought significant changes to the ongoing Democratic and Republican presidential nomination races.\n\nIn the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton's expected victories in Mississippi and Michigan did not materialize, while Bernie Sanders defied expectations in Michigan. Clinton's loss in Michigan, despite her strong performance in the debate and her lead in more populous states, was attributed to lower-than-expected African-American voter turnout and her failure to win the county that is home to Flint, the city with lead-poisoned water. Sanders, on the other hand, reprised his dominance among the youth vote and won an overwhelming number of counties throughout the state.\n\nIn the Republican race, Donald Trump's momentum seemed to stall out, with late-deciders breaking against him in Kentucky and Louisiana. However, Trump still won these states, albeit with a smaller margin than earlier tests. John Kasich, who was expected to gain momentum in Michigan as an establishment alternative to Trump, finished third, a hair or two behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nTed Cruz, who won in Idaho, showed his strength in small state events and second-place finishes. Despite his struggles in Southern states with big populations of evangelical white Protestants, Cruz has hung tough and racked up delegates. He is now just 99 delegates behind Trump, and if he can win a few of the winner-take-all states, he could catch up to Trump.\n\nMarco Rubio, who was expected to be the anti-Trump, has struggled in recent primaries and caucuses, finishing third or worse in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho, and Hawaii. Rubio has now staggered winless through two-dozen primaries and caucuses.\n\nIn the cold light of the day-after, it is possible the results from Tuesday will look different. Clinton's 66-point dominance in Mississippi won her nearly all that state's delegates, while Sanders' razor-thin margin in Michigan meant the two candidates split that state's delegates almost evenly. This makes it difficult for Sanders to overcome Clinton's delegate lead, even if he continues to best her in the voting booths from here through June. Sanders strategist Tad Devine is fond of saying the race is a marathon, not a sprint, but winning a race of any duration still requires you to finish first. Sanders needs to make a habit of doing just that, and by wider margins than his breakthrough in Michigan gave him.",
    " Title: American Democracy: A Call for Focus on Voting Rights and Process Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nJoshua A. Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who specializes in election law and voting rights, has expressed his support for the Electoral College result despite his personal disagreement with the election outcome. In an article published by CNN, Douglas argues that the Electoral College process worked as intended and reflects the will of the people in each state.\n\nDouglas acknowledges that external factors such as Russian influence, FBI Director James Comey's announcement of the continued investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails, and other issues may have affected the election. However, he emphasizes that these factors did not prevent people from voting and that the Electoral College vote represents the will of the people in each state.\n\nDouglas argues that the real issues that should concern Americans are the low voter turnout and barriers to voting for many Americans. He highlights the need to remove barriers to voting, encourage civic participation, and protect the fundamental right to vote against undue barriers. Douglas also suggests that the Electoral College system, which he believes is anti-democratic, should be abolished, but acknowledges that it is the current system in place.\n\nDouglas concludes by urging Americans to focus on fixing the voting process, abolishing the Electoral College, and addressing potential conflicts of interest, ties to Russia, and discriminatory policy positions of the incoming administration. He emphasizes that fighting the clear results of the November 8 election is unproductive, and instead, Americans should focus on exercising their fundamental right to vote, which he believes is the real battle that can save our democracy.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Afghanistan Strategy: Five Core Pillars, No Troop Level Increase Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump unveiled his strategy for Afghanistan on Monday, outlining five core pillars for the approach. The plan, which follows seven months of deliberation, includes adjustments to the current strategy rather than a complete change.\n\nThe five core pillars are:\n1. Eliminating any timelines for U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan.\n2. Utilizing all elements of power, including diplomatic and economic means.\n3. Toughening the stance on Pakistan.\n4. Encouraging India to contribute more to economic development.\n5. Expanding authorities for U.S. forces to combat terrorists.\n\nThe president did not specify the number of additional troops that would be deployed to Afghanistan, a decision he made earlier this year and left to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to determine. However, it has been reported that the president has approved a plan to send approximately 4,000 more troops.\n\nThe U.S. currently has about 8,400 troops in Afghanistan. The president stated that the U.S. would no longer discuss troop levels or withdrawal dates, leaving the possibility of troop increases unclear.\n\nThe president also mentioned the possibility of a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban and Afghanistan, but acknowledged that the timing and success of such a settlement is uncertain. He emphasized that the people of Afghanistan must take responsibility for their future and achieve lasting peace.\n\nTrump did not discuss the additional costs of the new strategy, but stated that the U.S. would seek more contributions from its NATO and other allies. The U.S. currently spends about $45 billion per year in Afghanistan.\n\nThe president acknowledged the frustration of Americans after 16 years of war without an end in sight, but stated that he did not want to repeat the mistakes made in Iraq by withdrawing too early, leaving a vacuum for terrorists to fill.\n\nTrump announced the new strategy at Army Post Fort Meyer in Arlington, Virginia, surrounded by soldiers, and emphasized the unity among forces working towards one mission. He called for the same unity among Americans.",
    " Title: States Face COVID-19 Budget Shortfalls: A Call for Federal Bailout vs. Long-Term Fiscal Solutions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to COVID-19-related budget shortfalls, some state and local officials are advocating for a nearly $1 trillion federal bailout. This equates to approximately $7,800 per household in new federal spending, surpassing the projected COVID-related state and local revenue losses for 2020 and 2021 combined.\n\nHowever, the issue with federal bailouts is not just the burden on taxpayers in fiscally responsible states to subsidize irresponsible ones. Federal bailouts also incentivize financially imprudent state and local lawmakers to avoid the consequences of their fiscal mismanagement.\n\nFor instance, states like Wyoming, Alaska, North Dakota, and New Mexico have saved more than 25% of their annual revenues in rainy day funds. In contrast, states such as Illinois, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey have set aside 1% or less.\n\nWhile some states have implemented austerity measures like pay freezes and hiring limits in response to COVID-19 shortfalls, others have opted for minimal restraint, relying on federal aid instead. Illinois, for example, adopted a 2021 budget that includes record-high spending, a $6 billion deficit, no reductions in personnel costs, large pay raises for unionized state workers and lawmakers, and excessive retiree costs that consume almost one-third of the state's own revenues.\n\nHistorically, big-spending states have benefited from federal bailouts, but these only drive up state spending and delay necessary reforms. Instead, states can address COVID-19 budget shortfalls, stimulate economic recovery, and pave the way for long-term prosperity without bailouts.\n\nOne approach is to safely reopen parts of society, balancing the need to save lives and livelihoods. Data-driven, localized reopening decisions that prioritize child care availability and in-person school options can help mitigate some of the damage caused by COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\nAnother strategy is for state and local lawmakers to focus on paring back recent spending increases. Florida, for example, has reduced per-capita and inflation-adjusted spending by 16% over the last two decades. In contrast, New York and California have increased their spending by 49% and 52%, respectively, during the same period.\n\nEducation and Medicaid spending are areas of excessive spending. Florida spends $9,075 per student on education, while New York spends $23,091. Yet Florida has experienced greater achievement gains, particularly among minorities. New York's Medicaid spending has increased 20% per recipient over just three years, amounting to a difference of $20 billion in 2019.\n\nStates can also achieve significant long-term savings by aligning public employee compensation with the private sector. Short-term changes, such as forgoing the annual 2% cost-of-living adjustment for 2021, could save states a collective $26 billion. A one-year pay freeze could save up to twice as much.\n\nSuspending public employee pension contributions and accruals for one year, a move some private-sector companies have taken to avoid layoffs, could save states up to $234 billion, enough to cover a 13% decline in state and local revenues for 2020.\n\nWhile the federal government can provide assistance, it would be more beneficial to help states cope with revenue losses by relieving them of the burden of unfunded federal mandates such as the Davis-Bacon Act, the new paid family and sick leave mandate, and education mandates.\n\nIn conclusion, the federal government can aid states, but federal bailouts are not the solution. State and local officials can respond sensibly, through short-term adjustments and responsible budgeting, to boost recovery and set the stage for a stronger future.",
    " Title: Record Number of Fires in Brazil's Amazon Rainforest in 2019\n\nArticle:\n\nFires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest have reached a record high number this year, according to data from the country's space research agency, the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Nearly 73,000 fires were recorded between January and August, compared with 39,759 in all of 2018, marking an 83 percent increase over the same period last year and the highest since INPE records began in 2013.\n\nSatellite images showed more than 9,500 new forest fires since Thursday, mostly in the Amazon basin, home to the world's largest tropical forest and seen as vital to slowing the pace of global warming. Images revealed that the northernmost state of Roraima was covered in dark smoke, while neighboring Amazonas declared an emergency in the south of the state and in its capital Manaus over the blazes. Acre, on the border with Peru, has been on environmental alert since Friday due to the fires.\n\nA daytime blackout on Monday in Sao Paulo caused by smoke brought in by strong winds from forest fires in Amazonas and the state of Rondonia, more than 2,700km away, prompted tens of thousands of people to take to social media and voice their concerns for the welfare of the Amazon rainforest. The hashtag #prayforamazonia subsequently became a global Twitter trend, with some commentators criticizing President Jair Bolsonaro for not doing enough to protect the environment.\n\nThe unprecedented surge in fires has occurred since Bolsonaro took office in January, vowing to develop the Amazon region for farming and mining, ignoring international concern over increased deforestation. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil, which ends in late October or early November, but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally clear forest for cattle ranching.\n\nINPE said the large number of wildfires could not be attributed to the dry season or natural phenomena alone. \"There is nothing abnormal about the climate this year or the rainfall in the Amazon region, which is just a little below average,\" said INPE researcher Alberto Setzer.\n\nPresident Bolsonaro brushed off widespread concerns, saying it was the time of the year of the \"queimada\" or burn, when farmers use fire to clear land. \"I used to be called Captain Chainsaw. Now I am Nero, setting the Amazon aflame. But it is the season of the queimada,\" he was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.\n\nEnvironmental activists pointed to a recent increase in deforestation as the trigger for the fires. \"What we are seeing is a consequence of the increase in deforestation seen in recent figures,\" said Ricardo Mello of WWF's Amazon Program.\n\nDeforestation in Brazil's portion of the Amazon rainforest soared more than 88 percent in June compared with the same month a year ago, according to INPE data. Last month, INPE published preliminary data showing deforestation in Brazil's portion of the Amazon rainforest soared more than 88 percent in June compared with the same month a year ago, the second consecutive month of rising forest destruction under Bolsonaro.\n\nBolsonaro fired the director of INPE following the publication of the statistics, saying they were inaccurate and smearing Brazil's reputation abroad. The Brazilian leader has faced mounting domestic criticism over his rhetoric regarding the environment, which activists blame for emboldening loggers, miners, and farmers in the Amazon.\n\nBolsonaro has also come under increased pressure from international powers to protect Brazil's environment under the terms of a landmark free trade deal brokered over two decades between the European Union and South American bloc Mercosur - of which Brazil is a member - and agreed to last month. The pact requires the Latin American giant to abide by the Paris climate accord, which Bolsonaro has threatened to pull out of, and also aims to end illegal deforestation, including in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nAmid the rise in deforestation, Norway and Germany halted tens of millions of dollars of Amazon protection subsidies to the Amazon Fund, accusing Brazil of turning its back on the fight against deforestation. The move came after Bolsonaro's administration unilaterally changed the fund's governance structure and closed down the steering committee that selects the projects to back, making no formal proposal for the composition of a new committee.\n\nBolsonaro reacted angrily to the suspension of funding and said Brazil would not take any lessons from the donor countries. \"Isn't Norway that country that kills whales up there in the North Pole?\" he told reporters. \"Take that money and help Angela Merkel reforest Germany,\" he said.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Faces No Real Pressure to Address Ferguson, Despite Calls for Involvement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an article published by MSNBC, Alex Seitz-Wald suggests that pressure is building on Hillary Clinton to address the situation in Ferguson, Missouri. However, the article asserts that Clinton is not under any real pressure to engage with the issue, given her strong position as the presumptive 2016 Democratic Party nominee.\n\nThe article notes that President Barack Obama is not expected to address the question of systematic racial injustice in the American criminal justice system, leaving a potential opportunity for the next Democratic Party presidential nominee to step in. The article suggests that the changing demographics of the country, with younger voters being less white and more liberal on economic issues, could push the party to tackle new issues that were too hot for previous Democratic leaders to handle.\n\nThe article further explains that the lack of a contested primary in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential race is denying the country the circumstances in which high-profile Democrats are forced to address the issues that Ferguson has placed on the national agenda. The article concludes by stating that the Democratic Party, with its more multiracial coalition, is expected to continue being the political vehicle for the interests of people of color for years to come.",

Bernie Sanders for President\n\nArticle:\n\nThree members of the progressive congressional group known as the \"Squad\" have announced their support for Sen. Bernie Sanders in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) have expressed their endorsement for Sanders.\n\nOn Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez will appear with Sanders at a \"Bernie's Back\" rally in Queens, NY. Omar has also endorsed the candidate, and while it is not immediately clear if Omar and Tlaib will attend Saturday's event, Tlaib is expected to endorse Sanders as well.\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter by the Sanders campaign, Omar was quoted as saying, \"Bernie is leading a working-class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity, and geography.\" Omar added, \"I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020.\"\n\nThe endorsements come after Tuesday night's Democratic debate in Ohio, where Sen. Elizabeth Warren was under attack from multiple candidates following her rise in the polls in recent weeks. The endorsements could be a significant blow to Warren's campaign, as she, like Sanders, represents the party's progressive wing.\n\nWinning the support of the \"Squad\" members is also crucial in attracting young voters, as the top three Democrats in the polls are all senior citizens: Sanders is 78, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76, and Warren is 70 years old.\n\nThere is no indication that the fourth member of the Squad, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), is ready to make an endorsement, either of Sanders or any other candidate.",
    " Title: Sen. Ted Cruz Links Debt Ceiling to Affordable Care Act Funding in CNN Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" with Candy Crowley, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) discussed the ongoing debate over the debt ceiling and its connection to funding the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Cruz stated that historically, the debt ceiling has been a powerful tool for Congress to rein in executive spending.\n\nCruz outlined three objectives for Republicans as they approach the debt ceiling:\n\n1. Pursue a significant structural plan to reduce government spending.\n2. Avoid new taxes.\n3. Seek ways to mitigate the harms from the ACA.\n\nThe senator noted that since 1978, the debt ceiling has been raised 58 times, with 20 instances involving specific and stringent requirements, often resulting in significant spending restraints. Cruz criticized the idea of increasing the nation's credit limit without any constraints, stating it as unreasonable.\n\nThe United States is expected to reach its borrowing limit on October 17. The government temporarily shut down on October 1 due to the House Republicans' refusal to pass a spending bill that would allow the government to pay its bills, as they sought changes or delayed implementation of the ACA. Sen. Cruz is often cited as the driving force behind the government shutdown, as he has urged fellow Republicans in the House to demand that any plan to fund the government be tied to defunding the ACA.\n\nCruz expressed concern that allowing the ACA to continue without changes would \"destroy the private health care system.\" He accused Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of refusing to take up a series of piecemeal bills passed by the House to fund certain parts of the government. Democrats in the Senate and the White House have stated they will only pass a \"clean\" spending bill that does not carry restrictions or changes to the health care law.\n\nCruz has faced criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans for the shutdown standstill. He responded to the criticism by stating that the intensity of the attacks indicates that they are winning the argument and that the ACA is not working.\n\nA CBS News poll released this week showed that 72% of Americans disapprove of the shutdown, with more Americans blaming congressional Republicans than President Obama. Despite this, Cruz does not believe his actions have negatively impacted his party's image.\n\n\"Not remotely,\" Cruz said. \"But I also think far too many people are worried about politics.\"",

The tweet, which has since been deleted, sparked a backlash from the Chinese Consulate-General in Houston, the Chinese Basketball Association, and the NBA.\n\nMorey's apology, posted on Twitter, stated, \"I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention.\" He continued, \"I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China.\"\n\nThe original tweet, which read, \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\" drew thousands of replies, most of them urging Morey not to apologize. The Hong Kong protests have been ongoing for four months, with thousands of protesters demonstrating against Beijing's influence over the city.\n\nThe Chinese Consulate-General in Houston criticized Morey's tweet, stating, \"We are deeply shocked by the erroneous comments on Hong Kong made by Mr. Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets. We have lodged representations and expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Houston Rockets, and urged the latter to correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact.\"\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association also condemned Morey's tweet, stating, \"The Chinese basketball association has expressed strong opposition to the remarks, and will suspend communication and cooperation with the Houston Rockets club.\" The current chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association is Yao Ming, who previously played for the Houston Rockets.\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta publicly rebuked Morey for the tweet, stating on Twitter that Morey \"does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets\" and that they are \"NOT a political organization.\"\n\nThe NBA released a statement in English on Sunday, stating, \"We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have offended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals' educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them.\"\n\nThe NBA's statement in Chinese, posted on popular social network Weibo, varied slightly from the English version, according to a translation. It stated, \"We are extremely disappointed by the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, who has undoubtedly seriously hurt the feelings of our Chinese fans. Morey has now clarified that his comments do not represent the position of the Rockets or the NBA.\"\n\nThe NBA was not immediately available for a follow-up request for comment. The NBA is China's most popular sports league and has formed partnerships with some of the country's biggest tech companies, as well as opened NBA retail stores there.",
    " Title: Attorney General Barr to Skip House Judiciary Committee Hearing, Dispute Over Questioning Methods Arises\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General William Barr will not appear at a highly anticipated hearing before the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, as negotiations over his appearance have stalled, according to a source on the committee who spoke to Fox News on Sunday.\n\nThe disagreement follows a series of criticisms from congressional Democrats, who have accused Barr of compromising his integrity to appease President Donald Trump. Barr has overseen the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report in recent weeks, a move that has made him a target for progressives who are frustrated that Mueller's investigation found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee Chairman, Jerry Nadler (D-NY), reportedly wants Judiciary Committee staff to question Barr on his handling of Mueller's report, but DOJ officials insist that members of Congress should conduct the inquiry.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions between the House Democrats and the Trump administration have escalated over full access to Mueller's report and government witnesses who have defied congressional subpoenas to testify. Democrats have been eager to question Barr as they attempt to build on Mueller's findings with their own investigations into the president.\n\nThe dispute over Barr's testimony could potentially end up in court. In the past, committees have made exceptions for committee counsels to question witnesses, but it is unusual for this to occur. For example, during Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing last year, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee hired an outside prosecutor to question a witness who had accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault.\n\nAt a previous House hearing, Barr faced a grilling from Democrats over his decision to release a four-page summary of Mueller's findings, which they deemed \"unacceptable.\" The new dispute comes as the House Democrats and the Trump administration continue to clash over the release of the complete Mueller report and government witnesses who have defied congressional subpoenas to testify.\n\nIn addition to the ongoing dispute over the Mueller report, the House Oversight Committee has scheduled an interview with Carl Kline, a former White House staffer who was at risk of being held in contempt of Congress. Kline has agreed to testify, potentially averting a separate showdown between Democrats and the White House. The panel subpoenaed Kline after a former subordinate told the panel that dozens of Trump administration officials were granted security clearances despite \"disqualifying issues\" in their backgrounds.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Differ on Economic Policies in Ohio Speeches\n\nArticle:\n\nIn separate speeches in Ohio on Thursday, President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, outlined their contrasting views on economic policies and the nation's economic future. The speeches, delivered in the crucial swing state, highlighted the divergent approaches the two candidates propose to address the country's economic challenges.\n\nPresident Obama, in his remarks, emphasized the importance of the election in shaping the nation's economic future. \"There is one place I stand in complete agreement with Mr. Romney,\" Mr. Obama said. \"This election is about our economic future.\"\n\nThe president did not present new policy prescriptions in his speech but instead contrasted his agenda with a detailed account of the Republican alternative. He criticized Republican policies over the past decade for driving up the deficit and benefiting the rich at the expense of the middle class. He also blamed these policies for the 2008 and 2009 recession, citing tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation, and spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as key factors.\n\n\"I don't believe that the government is the answer to all of our problems,\" Mr. Obama said. \"But what is holding us back is not a lack of big ideas, not a matter of finding the right technical solution.\"\n\nMr. Obama argued that the stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views on the direction America should take is what is hindering the economic recovery.\n\nMitt Romney, who spoke earlier in the day, emphasized private enterprise as the key to expanding the economy. He criticized the Obama administration's policies on financial regulation, health care, and energy, stating that these policies had stifled growth and hindered the recovery.\n\n\"I think he's made it harder for the American enterprise system to work,\" Mr. Romney said. \"And I want to change that. I want to make it once again, America the most attractive place in the world for job creators.\"\n\nThe speeches were delivered in front of smaller audiences, with about 1,500 people attending Mr. Obama's speech at a community college. The lower attendance was intentional, as the event was described as a \"speech, not a rally.\" However, the crowd was energetic, with many engaging in the wave, chanting the \"fired up, ready to go\" slogan from Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign, and cheering raucously.\n\nThe speeches came as both candidates grapple with the high national jobless rate, which remains above 8 percent. The president acknowledged the challenging environment, stating, \"There will be no shortage of gaffes and controversies that keep both campaigns busy and give the press something to write about.\"\n\nThe Romney campaign released a campaign advertisement titled \"Doing Fine\" on Thursday, which features a series of sour statistics and repeated video and audio of Mr. Obama stating that \"the private sector is doing fine.\" The ad closes with the statement, \"How Can President Obama Fix Our Economy... if He Doesn't Understand It's Broken?\"\n\nThe Obama campaign responded with a Web video featuring a highlight reel of Mr. Romney's own off-key moments, including quotes such as \"Corporations are people too, my friend\" and \"I'm also unemployed.\"\n\nThe simultaneous visits to Ohio underscored the state's significance in the fall election, with polls showing the two candidates in a virtual dead heat. Ohio's unemployment rate, at 7.4 percent, is almost a point below the national rate.",
    " Title: U.S. Senators Call for Open and Bipartisan Approach to Tax Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo U.S. Senators, Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Angus King (I-ME), have expressed concerns about the ongoing tax reform process in Congress, urging a more open, bipartisan approach to the legislation. They argue that the current process lacks input from Democrats, outside experts, affected communities, and ordinary citizens, and is rushing to pass a bill before an arbitrary deadline without proper consideration of its long-term implications.\n\nThe senators emphasize their concern over the significant reduction in revenues that both the Senate and House bills entail, which they believe will exacerbate the growing deficit and debt. They argue that the deficit spending, particularly during relatively good economic times, is unnecessary and counterproductive, as any rational business would be paying down debt rather than adding to it.\n\nOne of the senators' primary concerns is the disproportionate benefits the current tax proposals would provide to the largest companies and wealthiest individuals, while offering little to small businesses and middle-class families. They argue that the tax plan, if passed, would likely have minimal positive impact on the American economy, citing a strong consensus of economists.\n\nSenator Ron Johnson (R-WI) has proposed a solution to address this issue by treating all businesses the same, regardless of their organizational structure. Johnson suggests attributing the income of Subchapter C corporations to their owners and taxing that income at personal rates, a concept the senators find worth further examination.\n\nThe senators criticize the current closed process, which they believe has excluded important ideas that could promote economic growth without ballooning the debt or favoring one class of taxpayers over another. They point out that the current Senate Republican tax plan disproportionately benefits the 20% of businesses that organize as Subchapter C corporations, while doing less for the small businesses that drive the economy.\n\nThe senators argue that the current tax reform process lacks the necessary hearings, expert input, and compromise, and they call for a more open, bipartisan approach similar to the 1986 tax reform, which involved 36 hearings over ten months. They warn that missing the opportunity to pass tax reform in a responsible, bipartisan manner could lead to regret for years to come.",
    " Title: Treasury Department's Move Regarding Russia Sanctions Not a Sanctions Easing, Says White House\n\nThe Treasury Department's decision to allow U.S. companies to make limited transactions with the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia's intelligence agency, was not a sanctions easing, according to the White House. The move was a \"technical fix\" planned by the Obama administration to address an unintended consequence of the sanctions regime that prevented U.S. exporters of non-sanctioned electronic devices from complying with both U.S. and Russian law.\n\nOn Thursday, numerous media outlets and journalists claimed that President Donald Trump was easing or even lifting sanctions against Russia. However, President Trump and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated that no sanctions were being eased.\n\n\"I haven't eased anything,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"We're not easing sanctions,\" Spicer said, adding that it was a \"regular course of action.\"\n\nSenior Justice official John Harwood of NBC News reported that the Department had no input in the decision, and another DOJ official said the proposed immigration order was reviewed by Department lawyers before it was issued.\n\nThe media has been criticized for its coverage of the Trump administration, with some claiming that initial reports have been inaccurate or misleading. Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has called for tougher sanctions on Russia, agreed that Thursday's move was \"largely a technical fix.\"\n\nThe media whirlwind that followed the Treasury Department's actions proved unjustified almost instantaneously. The Twitter accounts of the two Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Thomas Hardiman, were not set up by the White House, as initially reported.\n\nThe White House's handling of information and the media's reporting of it has been a source of controversy and criticism. The incident with the Treasury Department's move regarding Russia sanctions is a prime example of the problem. Headlines struck in a matter of hours, followed by the release of information contradicting the initial reports.",
    " Title: New Racial Profiling Rules for Border Patrol Agents Announced by Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has announced new rules for Border Patrol agents that will include training requirements and the keeping of records on complaints related to profiling. These changes come in the wake of the president's decision to grant legal status to millions of immigrants who entered the country illegally.\n\nThe new rules are likely to be met with disappointment by some advocacy groups that have lobbied the administration on racial profiling for several years. Tanya Clay House, the public policy director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, expressed her group's disapproval, stating that racial profiling is ineffective, both in general and at the border.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder, the nation's first black attorney general, has been vocal against racial profiling. He has recounted personal experiences of being stopped by the police as a college student and as a federal prosecutor. However, law enforcement officials have generally supported his efforts to broaden protections for minorities.\n\nThe Justice Department initially planned to announce the revisions to the racial profiling rules earlier this year, but the White House intervened and ordered a broad review that included the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of the Border Patrol. The new guidelines result from months of negotiations between the Justice Department, Homeland Security, and the White House.\n\nThe rules offer more protection against discrimination than the Supreme Court has said the Constitution requires. The court has stated that border agents may not conduct roving traffic stops based on a motorist's apparent Mexican descent, but agents at checkpoints may single out drivers for interviews based on apparent Mexican ancestry.\n\nRepresentative Beto O'Rourke, a Texas Democrat who represents the border city of El Paso, questioned the effectiveness of such policies, stating, \"How can race help a Border Patrol agent or customs officer do a better job in a city like El Paso, where 85 percent of the people are Hispanic?\"\n\nLast year, the Border Patrol settled a racial-profiling lawsuit in which Washington State residents accused border agents of racial profiling while making traffic stops near the Canadian border. The government admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to retrain its agents on the profiling rules.\n\nThe new guidelines prohibit federal agents from relying on broad stereotypes, but they can consider race when responding to specific leads. For example, an agent investigating a crime could consider the race of a suspect if a witness describes them as tall, white, and blond.",

They have also pointed to voluntary safety measures, such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation's distribution of safety locks to gun owners, as evidence of their concern for reducing accidents.\n\nThe New York Times reached out to several gun manufacturers for comment, with most declining or not responding. Timothy A. Bumann, a lawyer for Taurus International Manufacturing, reiterated arguments made by gun executives in their depositions, stating that Taurus is not a law enforcement agency and has no legal duty to police its dealers and distributors. However, he added that the company is \"proactive in all the things it reasonably can do vis-\u00e0-vis the safe and lawful use of its product.\"\n\nLawrence G. Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry's trade association, stated in an email that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \"does not want manufacturers to play Jr. G-man.\" He also highlighted various collaborative efforts with the A.T.F., including a more than decade-old education program to prevent illegal gun purchases, as evidence of the industry's commitment.\n\nThe lawsuits have been bolstered by testimony from several former industry insiders. Notable among them is Robert Ricker, a former lawyer for the National Rifle Association and executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council, the main gun industry trade association before its disbandment. In a 2003 affidavit on behalf of the City of San Diego, Mr. Ricker wrote, \"Leaders in the industry have consistently resisted taking constructive voluntary action to prevent firearms from ending up in the illegal gun market and have sought to silence others within the industry who have advocated reform.\"\n\nMr. Ricker detailed the backlash he faced from the N.R.A. and trade groups due to his calls for reform. As a result, he was forced to resign as the head of the trade group. Another insider, Robert Hass, a former Smith & Wesson executive, testified that \"the nature of the product demands that its distribution be handled in such a way as to minimize illegal and unintended use.\" Yet, he stated in an affidavit, \"the industry's position has consistently been to take no independent action to ensure responsible distribution practices.\" When Smith & Wesson voluntarily adopted a set of safeguards, including requirements that its dealers limit multiple sales of firearms, it was ostracized and boycotted, forcing it to abandon the changes.",
    " Title: Violent Protests at Middlebury College Disrupt Speech by Conservative Political Scientist Charles Murray\n\nArticle:\n\nThe violent protests that occurred at Middlebury College last week, preventing conservative political scientist Charles Murray from delivering a speech, should not be dismissed as another episode in the ongoing campus speech wars. Murray is not just another right-wing provocateur; he is a scholar whose work has sparked significant debate and controversy.\n\nThe events at Middlebury College followed a familiar pattern. Murray was invited to speak by a conservative student group, and protesters assembled to prevent him from speaking. The speech was disrupted to the point of cancellation, and Murray recorded his speech for those who wished to hear it. Protesters continued to disrupt the proceedings, and Murray was physically threatened as he attempted to leave the building. One of the professors who accompanied him was injured by the mob.\n\nMurray's account of the events is distressing, but one point he makes is worth reiterating: this has not been his experience with past protests. The college did all the right things in advance, attempting to negotiate with the protesters and arranging for a backup plan to record the speech if the protests proved too disruptive. The college administration stood firmly and unequivocally for free speech and the marketplace of ideas. In his past experience, these measures have been adequate to ensure that protests remained civil and did not prevent him from speaking. This time, that was not enough.\n\nMurray is no stranger to protest; if he says something has changed, it is worth taking him seriously. He is infamous primarily for his 1994 book, The Bell Curve, which argued that IQ measured important differences in intelligence between individuals that were highly predictive of success across multiple dimensions, and because of this, our society was becoming increasingly stratified by cognitive ability. The primary locus of the controversy around the book related to his comments on differences in IQ between racial and ethnic groups, which Murray believes to be at least partly innate. It is understandable why such views would invite a furious response.\n\nHowever, the larger point about class stratification has only become more evident over time and became the focus of his most recent book, Coming Apart. And with the election of Donald Trump, the cultural consequences of that stratification have powered the most astonishing political upheaval of our time.\n\nAll of which is to say: Murray is someone students need to hear from. He may be utterly wrong in his explanations for the phenomena he is studying, and he may be thoroughly misguided in his proposed solutions. But he is asking questions that must be asked\u2014and that must be asked in particular of a community of higher education, which is a primary vehicle for the stratification he worries about.\n\nMoreover, the concerns Murray is airing should be of particular interest to the left, which historically stands against the concentration of economic and political power, and against domination by a ruling class. If meritocracy and equality of opportunity do not increase social mobility and reduce class stratification, but the opposite, that would seem to be at least as powerful an argument for old-school left-wing solutions, like strong labor unions and the redistribution of wealth, as it is for Murray's own conservative libertarianism.\n\nLeft-wingers should want to hear Murray\u2014and hear what answers can be had from his analysis\u2014more than conservatives should, because he is asking precisely the questions they need to answer. By ruling Murray unworthy of consideration, the radicals who protested him have not just traduced important norms related to free speech and civil respect (which would be bad enough), they have traduced those norms in the name of preserving themselves from having to question the institution they attend and its place in our society. A less-radical agenda than theirs is hard to imagine.\n\nThis is not a phenomenon limited to the left by any means. The same week that Murray was attacked at Middlebury, a bill was introduced into the Arkansas legislature to ban the work of radical historian Howard Zinn from public schools. But the right has an anti-liberal tradition to justify the notion that people should be \"protected\" from subversive, unpatriotic, or blasphemous views. And a right-wing legislator seeking to protect the existing power structure is at least acting in their own interest. The radical left is doing precisely the opposite.\n\nAt some point in an article like this, the writer typically says that they abjure Murray's abhorrent views but stand firmly for his right to air them, or that by engaging in violent and disruptive protest, you merely turn him into a martyr and thereby enhance his stature rather than silencing him. And if I were writing about an odious troll like Milo Yiannopoulos, and I bothered to write an article about him at all, I might say something like that.\n\nBut I'm not going to say that about Charles Murray. He deserves to be debated not only because free speech belongs to everyone, but because he is asking absolutely vital questions. And any left worth its salt would jump at every chance to demonstrate that they have better answers.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Decision: No Indictment for Officer Darren Wilson in Shooting of Michael Brown\n\nArticle:\n\nA grand jury has decided that there is not enough probable cause to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, which led to violent protests in Ferguson, Missouri. The grand jury's decision, like the shooting that sparked the unrest, has been a subject of intense debate.\n\nIn a rare move, the prosecuting attorney, Robert McCulloch, made public the evidence presented to the grand jury in an attempt to allay concerns about bias. The evidence includes thousands of pages of witness interviews, including testimony from Wilson and many witnesses.\n\nThe grand jury's decision hinges on the interpretation of events leading up to the shooting, particularly whether Brown was charging at Wilson or surrendering. Witness testimony has been inconsistent, with some witnesses stating that Wilson started shooting after he got out of the car, while others claim he started shooting from within the car. Some witnesses describe Brown as clearly surrendering, while others claim he did not appear to have been hit at all.\n\nOne witness, Witness 14, who is sympathetic to Brown, stated that Brown was \"executed\" and that Wilson had \"made up his mind to kill him.\" However, when federal investigators interviewed Witness 14, the witness's assumptions became less clear. The witness's account of Brown's hands being up as a sign of surrender is questioned, with the investigator leading the witness to admit that Brown was moving toward Officer Wilson, who was screaming as he fired his weapon.\n\nOfficer Wilson's testimony to the grand jury presents the image of an officer who was scared for his life during the confrontation with the larger man who he says was physically assaulting him. Wilson described Brown and his associate, Dorian Johnson, walking in the middle of the street, preventing normal traffic from passing. He stated that he told them to move to the sidewalk, and after a brief exchange, Brown used a vulgarity at him. Wilson said he called for backup and tried to open the door of his police car, but Brown slammed the door shut. They struggled, and Brown hit him in the face twice, Wilson said.\n\nWilson said he considered using Mace, his baton, and his flashlight before drawing his gun and telling Brown, \"Get back or I'm going to shoot you.\" Brown then grabbed his gun, Wilson said, and twisted it and dug it down into the officer's hip. The officer said he feared he would die if Brown got hold of the gun. He said he managed to raise the gun and fired twice. It just clicked. But the third time, the gun went off, startling both men.\n\nThat's when, Wilson said, Brown looked up at him \"and had the most intense aggressive face. The only way I can describe it, it looks like a demon, that's how angry he looked.\" He comes back towards me again with his hands up.\" Wilson said he tried firing again but nothing happened. When he tried once more, it went off. Brown then hit him again, he said.\n\nThe officer said that when he looked up, Brown was running away. Wilson said he got out of the car, called for backup, and began chasing Brown. He said Brown then stopped and he did, too. He said he ordered Brown to get on the ground, but the 18-year-old did not. He said Brown made an \"aggravated sound\" and ran back toward him. He said he warned Brown repeatedly to get on the ground, but when he did not comply, the officer fired \"a series of shots.\"\n\n\"I do not know how many I shot, I just know I shot it,\" he said.\n\nWilson explained his rationale for why he chased Brown, stating that he wanted to keep Brown \"contained\" until support arrived. He said he thought that if he could buy 30 seconds of time, until other officers arrived, they could \"make the arrest, nothing happens, we are all good.\"\n\nOne important part of this case is the physical evidence. The autopsy found that Michael Brown was never shot in the back, as some early witnesses claimed. Second, they found Brown's blood inside the police car and on Wilson's gun, implying close-range contact as Wilson alleges. Photographs taken of Wilson on the day of the confrontation show doctors diagnosing him with a bruise, which seems to cast some doubt on Wilson's testimony about the intensity of the confrontation.\n\nWe have uploaded most of the documents we received from prosecutors. We invite you to look through them and tip us off to anything you find interesting in the comments.",
    " Title: House Democrats' Impeachment Inquiry: Yovanovitch Testimony Kicks Off Friday\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Democrats' second public hearing in their impeachment inquiry begins at 9 am ET on Friday, featuring the testimony of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. The hearing can be watched on CSPAN or other major networks, with a live stream available.\n\nFriday's hearing will delve into the ouster of Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who was removed from her ambassador post in April, just days after Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, was elected. The hearing will provide a chronological step back from the alleged quid pro quo efforts that unfolded after Yovanovitch's departure from Kyiv.\n\nYovanovitch, a career foreign service officer for over three decades, was sworn in as ambassador to Ukraine in August of 2016 and held the post until her abrupt removal in the spring of 2019. She is currently a teaching fellow at Georgetown University.\n\nAccording to the accounts of other witnesses who have testified in the impeachment inquiry, Yovanovitch was highly respected among her colleagues. However, she ran afoul of two powerful individuals: Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, and Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, under the previous administration.\n\nIn an apparent effort to win President Trump's favor, Lutsenko and Giuliani began discussing the possibility that the Ukrainian prosecutor general could launch investigations into Trump's enemies. They discussed investigating Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas company whose board included Hunter Biden, as well as purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nYovanovitch objected when Lutsenko asked the US embassy to set up meetings with FBI or Justice Department officials, stating that such meetings were not typical. Instead, she encouraged him to meet with the FBI's legal attach\u00e9 in Kyiv. \"I don't think he really appreciated it,\" she told investigators.\n\nIn response, Lutsenko began spreading what Yovanovitch says was a completely fabricated story about her: that she gave him a list of people she didn't want him to prosecute. (Lutsenko has since recanted that story.) Rumors also spread that Yovanovitch was a Trump critic who was bad-mouthing the president in private. The purpose of these rumors seems to have been to push her out of the ambassadorship.\n\nThe smear campaign exploded into public view in March of 2019, when Lutsenko gave an interview to conservative journalist John Solomon of The Hill repeating the unsubstantiated allegation that Yovanovitch had given him a \"do not prosecute\" list.\n\nSoon, top Trump allies like Giuliani and Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity were openly attacking Yovanovitch. The president's son, Don Jr., also tweeted an article about calls to remove her, writing that the US needs \"less of these jokers as ambassadors.\"\n\nIn late April, just three days after Zelensky's election meant a new administration would come in, Yovanovitch received a call from a State Department official who told her to leave Ukraine on the next plane. The Deputy Secretary of State later explained to her that Trump had decided she had to go\u2014and the haste was due to fear Trump would attack her in a public tweet.\n\nYovanovitch was out. But when Trump spoke to Zelensky during their now-infamous phone call on July 25, her name came up. \"The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news, and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news, so I just wanted to let you know that,\" Trump said, according to a quasi-transcript released by the NSC. Later, he added: \"Well, she's going to go through some things.\"\n\nFor more of an idea of what Yovanovitch will say, read the transcript of her closed-door deposition at this link.\n\nFriday's hearing will close out this first week of impeachment inquiry hearings, but Democrats have set up a full slate of events for next week. On Tuesday, November 19, the morning will feature Jennifer Williams (a State Department official advising the vice president's office) and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (a National Security Council staffer). The afternoon will feature Kurt Volker (the former US special representative to Ukraine) and Tim Morrison (a National Security Council staffer).\n\nOn Wednesday, November 20, US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland will testify in the morning. Defense Department official Laura Cooper and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale will testify in the afternoon.\n\nThen, on Thursday, November 21, former National Security Council staffer Fiona Hill is scheduled to testify. It is unclear whether that will be the end of the public hearings or whether there will be more to come. But Democrats had hoped to complete this phase of their inquiry before Thanksgiving.",
    " Title: MSNBC Host Joy Reid Corrects Errors in Tweet About President Trump's Wives\n\nArticle:\n\nMSNBC host Joy Reid faced criticism for a tweet she posted on July 21, 2017, regarding President Donald Trump's wives. In the tweet, Reid attempted to suggest a connection between Trump and Russia by stating that two of his three wives are from nations that were once part of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe tweet read, \"Donald Trump married one American (his second wife) and two women from what used to be Soviet Yugoslavia: Ivana-Slovakia, Melania-Slovenia.\"\n\nHowever, there were several errors in the tweet. Reid was correct that one of the three women Trump has married is an American, Marla Maples, who was born in Georgia, a southern U.S. state, not the former Soviet republic. She was also correct that Melania Trump, whom Trump married in 2005, is from Slovenia.\n\nHowever, Trump's first wife, Ivana, is not from Slovakia. Nor was Slovakia part of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia, while communist, was not a member of the Soviet bloc. Ivana Trump, the mother of Trump's first three children, was born in what is now the Czech Republic, formerly known as Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia became a part of the Soviet bloc in 1948, a year before Ivana was born.\n\nReid later corrected one of the errors in her tweet, stating, \"Right- correction. Ivana is from Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). Good catch.\" She also noted that Slovenia, where Melania was born, is one of the five nations that once made up Yugoslavia.\n\nDespite the corrections, the tweet still contained an error, as Yugoslavia was not a part of the Soviet Union. Reid later tweeted, \"Melania is from Slovenia (which, plus Slovakia, used to be Yugoslavia).\"",
    " Title: House Progressives Call for Vote on Iran War Powers Legislation, Blocking Funding for Military Action\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse progressives have called for immediate votes on legislation to block funding for military action against Iran and to repeal the 2002 authorization of military force. The push comes after an airstrike last week that killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.\n\nFreshman Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA and Pentagon analyst who served multiple tours in Iraq and represents a competitive district, is expected to lead a resolution that would require the Trump administration's military hostilities with Iran to cease within 30 days if no further congressional action is taken.\n\nIn addition to the War Powers Resolution, members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are pushing for votes on two other measures. One, from Rep. Ro Khanna, would prohibit funds for offensive military force in or against Iran without prior authorization from Congress. The other bill, previously introduced by Rep. Barbara Lee last year, would repeal the 2002 authorization of military force against Iraq.\n\n\"In addition to the War Powers Resolution, we believe it is imperative to simultaneously pursue all avenues to prevent a disastrous war with Iran,\" Lee and Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chairmen Mark Pocan and Pramila Jayapal said in a joint statement. \"Given the lack of any coherent strategy by the White House to de-escalate tensions and protect U.S. troops, regional partners, and innocent civilians, Congress must act swiftly to prevent another endless war.\"\n\nThe House passed an annual defense authorization bill last summer that included the proposals from Khanna and Lee. However, both of their measures were ultimately left out of the final version that President Trump signed into law last month.\n\nThe War Powers Resolution to be unveiled by Slotkin and Democratic leaders this week to limit the Trump administration's actions against Iran is expected to pass easily with widespread support from Democrats. A House vote on the resolution has not yet been scheduled but is expected later in the week.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter to her colleagues on Sunday that \"As Members of Congress, our first responsibility is to keep the American people safe. For this reason, we are concerned that the Administration took this action without the consultation of Congress and without respect for Congress\u2019s war powers granted to it by the Constitution.\"\n\nIt's unlikely that Senate Republicans, who have largely backed Trump for ordering the strike that killed Soleimani, will support the measure to restrict his powers. Congress did pass a resolution last year to force the Trump administration to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, but Trump vetoed it. An attempt to override Trump's veto in the Senate fell short of the necessary two-thirds majority.\n\nTrump administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, are slated to brief members of the House and Senate about Iran on Wednesday.",
    " Title: GOP Presidential Debate: Rubio Emerges Victorious as Bush Faces Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican presidential debate on Wednesday in Boulder, Colorado, saw a significant shift in the political landscape, with Marco Rubio emerging as the clear winner and Jeb Bush facing criticism for his performance. According to a special edition of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus, a weekly survey of top operatives, activists, and strategists in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, nearly 60 percent of respondents deemed Bush's debate performance as a loss.\n\nBush's attempt to attack Rubio's Senate attendance record was met with swift counterpunches, leaving him looking opportunistic, desperate, and weak, according to several GOP insiders. Rubio, on the other hand, was praised for his preparedness and ability to handle Bush's attacks effectively.\n\nJeb Bush's sharpest attack, a well-rehearsed line about Rubio's missed Senate votes, was parried by the Florida senator, who responded calmly, \"Someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.\" Bush failed to respond effectively and was largely invisible for the rest of the night, finishing last in terms of speaking time.\n\nMarco Rubio's victory was not a solo effort; New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Texas Senator Ted Cruz finished second and third, respectively. Rubio's handling of the attendance issue and his response to Bush's attacks were highlighted as key factors in his victory.\n\nDemocrats also rendered a similar judgment, with 61 percent seeing a clear Bush loss and 42 percent giving Rubio the victory. The debate itself was choppy, with moderators struggling to control the dialogue and facing criticism for their tough questions.\n\nDonald Trump, the Republican front-runner, was not rated as the victor by any GOP insider, but barely any said he lost. Trump's performance was described as lackluster by some, with one respondent rating his performance a \"C\" and another finding him \"banal\" and disengaged in the latter portion of the debate.\n\nBen Carson, who recently surpassed Trump in a national poll, also failed to leave a significant mark, with just 6 percent saying he won and 10 percent saying he lost.\n\nThe debate marked a significant moment in the Republican primary race, with Rubio emerging as a strong contender and Bush facing criticism for his performance. The next Republican debate is scheduled for November 10 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.",
    " Title: House Republicans Work to Limit Defections on Trump's Emergency Declaration Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans are making efforts to limit the number of defections on a legislative measure aimed at blocking President Donald Trump's emergency declaration to potentially under a dozen on Tuesday. The White House and GOP leaders are making a last-minute push to avoid a humiliating defeat for the president, according to multiple Republican sources.\n\nSo far, only one Republican, libertarian Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), has backed a Democratic measure to overturn Trump's national emergency declaration. The House vote on Tuesday could set the tone in the Senate by offering political cover to Republican senators who have expressed concerns about Trump's move to secure billions of dollars without Congress's approval.\n\nHouse Democrats believe they could win support from between five to 10 Republicans in Tuesday's much-anticipated floor vote, according to two sources. In an attempt to drum up GOP support, Democrats have circulated a spreadsheet of hundreds of military construction projects that the White House could potentially take money from for its border project.\n\nPressure has been building, with Pentagon officials visiting Capitol Hill on Friday to brief top defense spending leaders of both parties on where the administration could divert $3.6 billion from military projects to the border. Trump has vowed to veto the Democratic resolution, and House Republican leaders are confident that they will fall far short of the more than 50 Republican votes they'd need for an override.\n\nRep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) and four other House Republicans sent a letter to Trump earlier this month urging him to look elsewhere for the money. Turner, a defense hawk whose state could lose as much as $90 million in military construction funds, has said Trump's move would be a \"dangerous precedent.\" However, he has not specifically said if he would support the Democratic resolution.\n\nRep. Roger Williams (R-Texas) initially feared that Trump's move could take money from Fort Hood, which is in his district. But last week, he received a personal assurance from Pentagon officials that no existing funding would be used. \"That's a big deal to me,\" Williams said Monday night, confirming that he would vote against the resolution.\n\nTrump began applying public pressure to his own party on Monday, warning Republicans not to fall into the Democratic \"trap.\" The White House legislative affairs team has also been making the case privately to Republican lawmakers over the weekend and on Monday, according to a White House official. Officials have been doing outreach to provide \"as much information as possible,\" and plan to take a more targeted approach after they learn which GOP members are considering voting for the measure.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise sent talking points to the GOP caucus on Monday, stating that there are already 31 national emergencies in effect, and that Trump is specifically working to address a \"humanitarian and security crisis.\" Separately, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise will begin formally counting votes Monday night. The White House is eyeing a total of $8 billion in border cash, which would also include $2.5 billion from a Pentagon drug interdiction program as well as $600 million from a Treasury Department forfeiture fund. Since Trump's announcement earlier this month, groups of former national security officials and former GOP members of Congress have also expressed opposition to the move.",

In the interview, Johansson discussed the confrontation between political correctness and art, stating that \"as an actor, I should be able to play any person, or any tree, or any animal because that is my job and the requirements of my job.\"\n\nThe comments made by Johansson were picked up by the Daily Mail and caused an uproar, leading Johansson to release a statement claiming the article was \"edited for clickbait and is widely taken out of context.\" The interview was not a standard profile, but rather a collaboration between Johansson and contemporary painter David Salle, during which they worked on a photoshoot featuring Salle's work.\n\nIn the interview, Johansson discussed her acting role models of the 1950s, such as James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Marlon Brando, and their liberated and unapologetic portrayal of emotions. Johansson also addressed the issue of casting, stating that \"today there's a lot of emphasis and conversation about what acting is and who we want to see represent ourselves on screen. The question now is, what is acting anyway? Right. Who gets to play what roles... You know, as an actor I should be allowed to play any person, or any tree, or any animal because that is my job and the requirements of my job.\"\n\nJohansson clarified her point in a statement, stating that \"I personally feel that, in an ideal world, any actor should be able to play anybody and Art, in all forms, should be immune to political correctness. That was the point I was making, albeit didn't come across that way.\" Johansson also acknowledged the widespread discrepancy in the industry that favors Caucasian, cis-gendered actors and the need for diversity in any industry.\n\nIn a separate interview, co-star, screenwriter, and director of Johansson's upcoming movie Jojo Rabbit, Taika Waititi, discussed his role in the movie and his general theory of casting, stating, \"Week one down of our anti-fuckface satire, Jojo Rabbit. Can't wait to share it with the world. Also, what better way to insult Hitler than having him portrayed by a Polynesian Jew?\" This example shows that racially insensitive casting can be used for good as well as evil, as long as it is used to be disrespectful.",

The 19-year-old immigrant of Chechen heritage, who authorities believe set two bombs near the race's finish line, was apprehended on Friday night.\n\nThe Boston Police Department announced the capture with a Twitter post that read, \"CAPTURED!!

Thanks to them \u2013 the people of Boston will sleep well tonight.\"\n\nThe manhunt, which lasted a day, had initially labeled the suspect as \"Suspect #2\" by the FBI. He was last seen after a Friday shootout that killed his brother, \"Suspect #1\" Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in the Boston suburb of Watertown. The suspect was eventually captured in Watertown.\n\nUnfortunately, another person was killed during the manhunt \u2013 Sean Collier, a campus police officer at MIT. Transit officer Richard Donahue was severely injured.\n\nThe lifting of the lockdown, early Friday evening, aided in the apprehension of Suspect #2.

    " Title: Trump Campaign Aides Reportedly Had Frequent Contact with Russian Intelligence Officials\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Russian influence scandal surrounding the White House has intensified as reports emerged on Tuesday that some of Donald Trump's campaign aides had regular contact with Russian intelligence officials throughout 2016. The New York Times reported that four current and former US intelligence officials, who remain unnamed, have not found evidence in intercepted phone communications that Trump campaign officials cooperated with Russian intelligence in Moscow's attempts to sway the election in Trump's favor. However, the contacts' purpose remains unclear.\n\nCNN reported that \"high-level advisers close to then-presidential nominee Donald Trump were in constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to US intelligence.\"\n\nThese reports contradict White House spokesman Sean Spicer, who, on Tuesday, reiterated his previous assertions that there were no pre-election contacts between the Trump team and Russian officials. Last month, Trump himself also denied any such contacts.\n\nThe reports add pressure on the Republican congressional leadership to launch committee hearings on Russian election interference, which were promised but have yet to materialize. They also indicate that intelligence officials are willing to leak against the Trump administration, making it risky for the White House to try to shut down investigations into collusion with Moscow that are reportedly being carried out by several intelligence agencies.\n\nThe reports add circumstantial weight to the reports on the Trump campaign's Kremlin links compiled last year and passed to the FBI by a former MI6 officer, Christopher Steele. His reports alleged active, sustained, and covert collusion to subvert the election, which, if confirmed, could constitute treason.\n\nTrump responded with a series of angry tweets on Wednesday, claiming the Russian connection allegations are merely an attempt to cover up mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign. He also accused the intelligence community of \"unAmerican\" leaks to newspapers and called the reports \"fake news.\"\n\nThe only Trump associate named in the New York Times report as having participated in the contacts was Paul Manafort, who was the Trump campaign manager for several months last summer. Manafort has repeatedly denied any contacts with Russian officials.\n\nManafort left the Trump campaign in August, after allegations about his activities in Ukraine first surfaced. At about the same time, the campaign also distanced itself from a US businessman, Carter Page, whom Trump had previously described as an adviser, after Page was reported to have had contacts with Vladimir Putin's top lieutenants. Page called the reports \"complete garbage.\"\n\nThe new reports of the Trump campaign's contacts with Moscow rekindled bitterness among former campaign aides to Hillary Clinton, over a pre-election announcement by the FBI director, James Comey, that new material was being studied in an investigation of her use of a private internet server for her emails. That investigation came to nothing, but Clinton officials were convinced the bad publicity, just 11 days before the election, cost her crucial votes. By contrast, they point out, the Republican Comey said nothing about investigations underway at the same time into Trump's Russian links.\n\n\"I'd like the FBI to explain why they sent a letter about Clinton but not this,\" Clinton's former campaign manager, Robby Mook, said in a tweet on Tuesday night. Her former spokesman, Brian Fallon, tweeted, \"Everything we suspected during the campaign is proving true. This is a colossal scandal.\"",

He recounts his first job as a high school biology-laboratory assistant, where he gained valuable skills and scientific knowledge that proved beneficial in his future endeavors.\n\nCarson held various jobs throughout his youth, each providing unique skills and experiences. He worked as a mailroom clerk, learning the importance of accuracy, speed, and organization. He also worked as a student assistant to the police department, meeting distinguished individuals and gaining exposure to various experiences.\n\nAs a supervisor for a highway cleanup crew, Carson learned about managing people and eventually secured a higher-paying factory job and his dream summer job of driving sports cars off the assembly line. He emphasizes that working leads to the acquisition of knowledge, experience, relationships, and opportunities for advancement, which are crucial components of realizing the American dream.\n\nCarson acknowledges the challenges in today's job market and the potential appeal of public aid for those seeking sustenance. However, he argues that pursuing minimum-wage jobs offers valuable skills and opportunities that may not be available through public aid.\n\nCarson recalls his experiences finding summer jobs during his college years, emphasizing the importance of persistence and initiative. He suggests that young people looking for jobs should approach small businesses directly, expressing their eagerness to work and their college status. Carson believes that employers are more likely to retain valuable, productive employees, and that such opportunities may not present themselves to those relying on public entitlements.\n\nCarson concludes by emphasizing the importance of supporting and encouraging young people in their job-seeking endeavors, as the grooming of youth is essential for the future success of the nation and the pursuit of happiness for all.",
    " Title: World War II Memorial Closure and Healthcare.gov Issues Highlight Government Inefficiency During Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nThis week, the ongoing U.S. government shutdown resulted in the closure of the World War II Memorial, preventing veterans from visiting their own memorial. Despite the shutdown, some World War II veterans disregarded the barricades and gathered at the memorial. Meanwhile, the rollout of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) faced significant issues, with the healthcare.gov website crashing and millions of Americans experiencing difficulties with the new healthcare system.\n\nThe shutdown has been a source of controversy, with many Americans expressing frustration over the closure of the World War II Memorial. Some speculate that it may have cost more to place the barricades than to leave them unrestricted. Regardless, the veterans' determination to visit their memorial was evident, as they managed to gather at the site despite the government-imposed barriers.\n\nIn addition to the World War II Memorial closure, the rollout of Obamacare has faced numerous challenges. The healthcare.gov website, designed to facilitate the enrollment process for the new healthcare system, experienced technical difficulties, causing frustration for many Americans. President Barack Obama compared the issues to the glitches that occur when Apple unveils a new product, but the analogy has been met with criticism.\n\nIt is important to note that all members of Congress will be required to obtain healthcare through the Obamacare exchanges, as will their staff. In some states, such as Kentucky, the number of insurance providers available has decreased significantly compared to previous options. While the author experienced only minor issues with Obamacare, many Americans have faced more substantial concerns, including the potential loss of their current plans, new law-related worries, potential fines, privacy concerns, and even job security.\n\nThe shutdown has been a contentious issue, with both parties offering compromises to keep the government operating. The author, for example, proposed an amendment to extend the government shutdown for an additional week to allow for continued negotiations. However, all proposals have been rejected by the Democrats.\n\nCritics argue that the government's handling of the shutdown and the rollout of Obamacare highlights the inefficiency and incompetence of the U.S. government. The author suggests that the government's inability to effectively manage national healthcare and even smaller-scale operations, such as overseeing a war memorial, demonstrates a systemic problem within the government.\n\nAnnual trillion-dollar deficits and a $17 trillion debt are further evidence of the government's inefficiency. The author concludes that the shutdown serves as a reminder of the government's dysfunctional nature, particularly in taking on too many functions and ultimately failing to meet the needs of the American people.",
    " Title: Justice Ginsburg Denies Temporary Block on Official Depositions in Census Lawsuit\n\nArticle:\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has denied the Trump administration's request for the Supreme Court to temporarily block lower court-ordered document requests and depositions of two key officials behind the controversial plan to add a question about citizenship status to the 2020 census. However, Ginsburg left the door open for the administration to request a permanent block in the future.\n\nThe administration has signaled its intention to escalate the legal fight over the citizenship question to the high court. This move could involve a request for the Supreme Court to order lower courts to stop the depositions or for the high court to hear the case.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs in the two lead cases have been preparing to question Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Justice Department official John Gore in their final weeks of evidence-gathering, which is scheduled to end on Oct. 12. A potential trial for these lawsuits is set to start on Nov. 5 at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nLast month, a judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put Ross' deposition on hold while the request was under review. In a filing on Wednesday, Solicitor General Noel Francisco at the Justice Department, which is representing the administration in the six lawsuits around the country over the hotly contested question, wrote that he was preemptively asking the Supreme Court to consider blocking Ross' Oct. 11 deposition in case the 2nd Circuit refuses to do so.\n\nA three-judge panel is set to review the administration's earlier request for the 2nd Circuit to stop Ross' deposition on Oct. 9.\n\nThe Trump administration has been trying to convince the courts that deposing Ross and Gore is not necessary to resolve these lawsuits and that the judges should instead rely on the record of internal memos, emails, and other documents already released by the administration.\n\nIn their earlier request for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to block Ross' deposition, Justice Department attorneys wrote, \"The validity of the Secretary's decision is properly judged on that objective record, without inquiry into Secretary Ross's deliberative process and any subjective reasons he might have had for favoring the reinstatement of a citizenship question.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly tried to block discovery in the lawsuits, and courts have repeatedly rejected their attempts. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman had previously allowed the plaintiffs' attorneys to question Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau as the head of the Commerce Department. Ross announced in March that he approved the Justice Department's request to add a citizenship question to forms for the upcoming national head count.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit recently upheld Furman's separate order for the deposition of Gore, who leads the Justice Department's civil rights division, which argues that it needs responses to the citizenship question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act's protections of racial and language minorities from discrimination.\n\nThe plaintiffs, who include dozens of states, cities, and other groups that want the question removed, claim that Ross misused his authority and discriminated against immigrant communities of color by ordering the 2020 census to inquire about U.S. citizenship status\u2014a topic that has not been included in the census for all U.S. households since 1950.\n\nCritics of the question point to Census Bureau research suggesting that asking about citizenship status could discourage households with noncitizens, including unauthorized immigrants, from participating in the once-a-decade head count of every person living in the U.S., as required under the Constitution.\n\nHowever, Furman has ruled, in part, that the officials should be deposed because of documents suggesting that better enforcement of the Voting Rights Act was not the main driver behind the push for a citizenship question.\n\n\"Secretary Ross must sit for a deposition because, among other things, his intent and credibility are directly at issue in these cases,\" Furman wrote in an opinion filed last month.\n\nAs NPR has reported, an internal email exchange released as part of the lawsuits provided an early indication that the Trump administration was preparing to defend the citizenship question at the Supreme Court months before the Justice Department formally submitted its request for the question in December 2017.",
    " Title: Trump Suggests Apple Move Production to U.S. to Avoid Tariff-Related Price Increases\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has suggested that Apple Inc., a major tech company based in Cupertino, California, could avoid potential price increases on some of its products due to proposed additional tariffs on Chinese-made goods by moving production to the United States. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump stated, \"Apple prices may increase because of the massive Tariffs we may be imposing on China \u2014 but there is an easy solution where there would be ZERO tax, and indeed a tax incentive, if the company made its products in the U.S. instead of China.\"\n\nThis week, Apple announced that a proposed new round of $200 billion in additional tariffs on Chinese imports could raise prices on some of its products, including the Apple Watch and the Mac mini. The company is heavily exposed to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, as it manufactures many of its products for the U.S. market in China and sells gadgets, including the iPhone, in China, making them potential targets for Chinese retaliation against the Trump tariffs.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has not announced plans to move manufacturing from China to the U.S.\n\nIn a letter this week to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Apple stated, \"because all tariffs ultimately show up as a tax on US consumers, they will increase the cost of Apple products that our customers have come to rely on in their daily lives.\" The company added that tariffs would hit \"a wide range of Apple products,\" including computers, watches, adapters, chargers, and tools used in its U.S. manufacturing, repair, and data centers. Apple stated that the tariffs would raise the cost of its U.S. operations and put it at a disadvantage to foreign rivals.\n\nThe White House has accused China of stealing U.S. intellectual property and forcing American companies to share their technology with Chinese companies. The tariffs are intended to pressure China to stop this behavior, the administration has said. However, Apple stated, \"it is difficult to see\" how tariffs would advance the government's goal.\n\nThe presidential tweet is the latest development in a dispute between the Trump administration and companies that fear tariffs will hurt their business. The Trump administration has already imposed tariffs of $50 billion on imports from China, mostly equipment and material used by manufacturers. In July, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that these measures had no effect on Apple. However, the company is concerned about the Trump administration's proposal to add 25 percent duties on another $200 billion in Chinese goods, including a wider assortment of consumer-related items.",
    " Title: U.S. and Allies Face Tension Over Palestinian Resolution at United Nations\n\nArticle:\n\nA diplomatic standoff is developing at the United Nations as Palestinian officials, along with their allies, push for a resolution demanding Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank and East Jerusalem within two years. The Obama administration is grappling with the situation, attempting to ease tensions and establish a position that prioritizes halting the escalating Israeli-Palestinian violence and creating conditions for future peace talks.\n\nInitially, Palestinian officials planned to submit the resolution for a potential vote on Wednesday. However, with the U.S. likely to veto the resolution, the vote may be postponed.\n\nOn Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry urged against any actions that could interfere or be perceived as interfering in Israeli elections scheduled for March. Kerry emphasized the importance of lowering tensions and ending the violence to create an opportunity for both Israelis and Palestinians to find a mutually desired path for peace.\n\nKerry declined to categorize the U.S.'s position on suggestions for the U.N. Security Council to set a framework for negotiations, which Israel strongly opposes. The U.S. is currently engaged in constructive conversations with all parties involved.\n\nKerry's meetings on Monday included discussions with chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and foreign ministers from Britain, France, and Germany.\n\nFor the Obama administration, this issue represents a delicate situation. The administration has recently quelled speculation about potential U.S. sanctions on Israel, but it has expressed objections to certain settlement expansions in territory the Palestinians desire for a future state.\n\nThe most hard-line, pro-Palestinian U.N. resolution is being drafted by Jordan, on behalf of the Palestinians. This resolution would demand a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank within two years and full recognition of Palestine as a state, without mention of land swaps or security measures.\n\nThe U.S. and France have also drafted versions of a Security Council resolution, though they have not been submitted. Council diplomats, who requested anonymity, told Fox News that the French draft of the resolution is less hostile toward Israel than the one being put forward by Jordan, but it does parallel concepts in that text, most notably calls for an Israeli withdrawal by a determined deadline. The U.S. Mission is not disclosing details of its draft, but its existence indicates the Obama administration may feel a U.N. resolution of some kind is necessary.\n\nFrance's resolution reportedly uses the 1967 Mideast borders as the basis for dividing the land, which President Obama has publicly endorsed, but it does not include key Israeli and U.S. conditions such as Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state.\n\nIn Paris on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius made his case to Elaraby, Egyptian and Palestinian ministers, and former Israeli President Shimon Peres. Fabius emphasized the need to resume peace talks, but Peres stated that a Palestinian state would be better achieved \"through an agreement than through an imposition.\"\n\nSupport for France's resolution within Europe is uncertain, despite mounting pressure for legislators across the continent to hold votes recognizing a Palestinian state. Countries are divided over the idea of setting a 2016 deadline, with Germany particularly reluctant, diplomats said.\n\nKerry cited several examples of the downward security trend in Israel and the West Bank, including Israelis being stabbed, axed, or subjected to acid attacks, as well as the recent loss of a senior Palestinian official during protests, the burning of a mosque near Ramallah, and \"price tag\" attacks by Jewish extremists.\n\n\"We want to find the most constructive way of doing something that therefore will not have unintended consequences, that also stems the violence,\" Kerry said.\n\n\"It's a particular sensitive moment because we understand the frustrations of Palestinians,\" he added. \"They do not see another course at this moment.\"\n\nThe key, Kerry said, is to \"try to find whether or not there are other options, other ways, other courses...to respect the process that Israelis are about to undergo.\"",
    " Title: Trump Announces Deployment of ICE to Sanctuary Cities for Immigration Enforcement\n\nArticle:\n\nLast Monday, former President Donald Trump announced via Twitter his intention to deploy Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to various American sanctuary cities to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. The announcement sparked a heated response from the left, illegal immigrant rights groups, and the media.\n\nThe statement was met with criticism, but Trump's proclamation was based on the need to address the issue of illegal immigration, which he argued is detrimental to the nation's sovereignty, economy, and national security. Current estimates put the total number of undocumented immigrants in the United States at over 12 million, although exact numbers are difficult to determine due to questions about citizenship on the national census.\n\nThe Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) conducted a study regarding the financial impact of illegal immigration, finding that services provided to these individuals and their families totaled over $135 billion. This figure highlights the financial burden that the presence of undocumented immigrants places on the government.\n\nThe article also points out the connection between illegal immigration and crime, citing high-profile cases such as the 2015 murder of Kate Steinle by an undocumented immigrant and the 2018 brutal killing of Mollie Tibbetts. The federal government's report of 2,028 murders by undocumented immigrants arrested in 2018 is also mentioned.\n\nThe article argues that the presence of sanctuary cities, which do not comply with federal immigration laws, exacerbates the problems associated with illegal immigration. Citing examples of homelessness and crime in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, the article suggests that sanctuary cities attract more illegal border crossers and contribute to the overall problem.\n\nThe article also addresses the argument that the issue of illegal immigration is framed as a racial issue by the left. The article argues that this framing is a logical fallacy and that the focus on race obscures the real issues at hand.\n\nFinally, the article compares the issue of illegal immigration to a cancer, with sanctuary cities being the tumors and ICE being the chemotherapy. The article concludes by stating that Trump has placed a two-week hold on his plan, hoping that Congress can address the issue of illegal immigration.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Immigration Legislation Proposed as Government Funding Deadline Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nSenators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) will introduce immigration legislation on Monday, aiming to address the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and border security measures. The bill, if passed, would provide legal status and a path to citizenship for individuals who meet certain criteria, primarily those who have lived in the U.S. since December 31, 2013.\n\nThe proposed legislation, details of which were shared on Sunday, would not include funding for the border wall, a key demand of President Trump and conservative Republicans. The bill instead calls for a study to determine necessary border security measures and a strategy for situational awareness and operational control of the border by 2020.\n\nThe bill also includes provisions to address the backlog in the immigration court system by hiring 55 new judges per year, as well as dozens of staff attorneys, for three years. Additionally, it directs the State Department to submit a three-year strategy aimed at addressing the underlying causes of immigration from Central America.\n\nPresident Trump, in a statement on Monday, expressed his disapproval of any proposed solution that does not include border wall funding, calling it a \"total waste of time.\"\n\nSenator McCain, in a statement on Sunday, emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation to address the impending expiration of the DACA program and secure the southern border. He stated, \"It's time we end the gridlock so we can quickly move on to completing a long-term budget agreement that provides our men and women in uniform the support they deserve.\"",
    " Title: President Trump to Declare National Emergency for Border Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced plans to declare a national emergency in an effort to secure funding for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall without congressional approval. This move is expected to spark a constitutional conflict between the President and Congress.\n\nAfter conceding defeat in his demand for $5.7 billion in wall funding from Congress, Trump agreed to sign a government-funding bill that lacks money for the wall but prevents another government shutdown. The bill, which was passed by both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, contains funding for fencing and other forms of border security, but it does not include the wall, a key promise in Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nThe bill is expected to be signed by the President on Friday before he departs for his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida for a holiday weekend break. \"President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action - including a national emergency,\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.\n\nThe top Democrat in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, denounced the President's move. Asked about a potential legal challenge to an emergency declaration, Pelosi said, \"I may, that's an option.\" Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer accused Trump of a \"gross abuse of the power of the presidency.\"\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated he will support Trump on the emergency declaration, despite earlier cautioning the President that such a move could divide Senate Republicans. An emergency declaration could infringe on Congress' authority to make major decisions about taxpayer funds, a fundamental check and balance spelled out in the Constitution.\n\nFor weeks, the White House has explored the possibility of invoking a national emergency to redirect taxpayer funds committed by Congress for other purposes toward the wall. The national emergency strategy, expected to be declared by Trump on Friday, is already dividing Republicans.\n\nThe administration has identified nearly $7 billion to reallocate for the wall, including $600 million from a Treasury Department forfeiture fund, $2.5 billion from a Defense Department drug interdiction fund, and $3.5 billion from a military construction budget. These funds would cover only part of the estimated $23 billion cost of the wall promised by Trump along the 2,000-mile (3,200-km) border with Mexico.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate passed the government funding bill by a vote of 83-16, and the Democratic-led House by a vote of 300-128, with 86 House Republicans voting in favor. The measure would provide more than $300 billion to fund the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year. It also includes $1.37 billion in new money to help build 55 miles (88.5 km) of new physical border barriers.\n\nFunding for those agencies was due to expire on Friday, which would trigger another partial federal shutdown on Saturday morning if Trump unexpectedly refuses to sign the bill. Some of Trump's fellow Republicans have warned him that declaring a national emergency could set a dangerous precedent, opening the door for a future Democratic president to circumvent Congress and declare emergencies on perhaps climate change, gun control, or healthcare insurance.\n\nPelosi stated, \"If the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency - an illusion that he wants to convey - just think of what a president with different values can present to the American people.\" Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said, \"I will pull out all the stops to stop this horrendous, bizarre idea. As people get a chance to sort through what the implications really are, we will have strong bipartisan support for opposing this.... We are the appropriators, not the president.\"",
    " Title: White House Celebrates President Obama's 2015 Policy Wins, Despite Congressional Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his final press briefing of the year, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest highlighted President Obama's achievements in 2015, emphasizing that the administration successfully advanced many of its priorities despite Republican majorities in Congress. The president's accomplishments, according to Earnest, were primarily achieved through executive action or treaty-like agreements that avoided the need for congressional approval.\n\nThe restoration of diplomatic ties with Cuba, the Paris climate change agreement, and the halting of the Keystone pipeline were among the administration's key victories. The Paris agreement, reached with other world leaders, was a significant achievement despite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's efforts to scuttle it.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan countered that the budget deal reached this week demonstrates the GOP's effectiveness as an opposition party. He stated that the deal reins in the IRS, stops EPA overreach, and blocks several Obamacare provisions and the taxpayer bailout of the \"risk corridor\" program for health insurance companies that lose money under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe White House did not mention the federal courts, which have dealt a major setback to the president's immigration plan, or the rise of the Islamic State, the failure of economic sanctions on Russia, or the administration's inability to impact the civil war in Syria and the resulting refugee crisis in Europe.\n\nThe administration's repeated call for raising the federal minimum wage has also gone unfulfilled, leading to collaborations with states and employers to raise their own wage rates. When asked about the president's low job-approval rating, Earnest attributed it to the December 2 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California.\n\nEarnest claimed that the president does not worry about polls or news cycles, stating that the unifying theme of the administration's accomplishments was their long-term impact rather than productive management of the news cycle. One of the few legislative initiatives that Mr. Obama won in Congress this year was the measure that granted him trade promotion authority, which helped him conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement in October with 11 other nations.\n\nHowever, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that the Senate will likely postpone consideration of TPP until after the presidential election in November or until after President Obama leaves office in January 2017. Democratic lawmakers are uniformly opposed to the pact. Republicans control both the House and Senate, and few legislative initiatives typically get done in a presidential election year.\n\nPresident Obama will depart Washington on Friday for his annual two-week vacation in Hawaii, stopping in California on the way to meet with families of the victims of the San Bernardino terrorist attack.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Overturns Texas Abortion Law Requiring Hospital-Like Standards for Clinics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has ruled 5-3 against a Texas pro-life law that mandated physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and required clinics to meet hospital-like standards for outpatient surgery. The ruling is being described by some as another example of \"abortion distortion\" by Matthew Clark, with the American Center for Law and Justice.\n\nThe law, signed by former Governor Rick Perry in 2013, was argued by Texas lawmakers to protect women's health. It required abortion doctors and clinics to meet the same standards for other doctors, clinics, and hospitals in the state. However, Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, argued that the surgical requirement, including the admitting privileges requirement, provides few, if any, health benefits for women and constitutes an \"undue burden\" on their constitutional right to have an abortion.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, and justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas disagreed with the ruling. Thomas stated that the court's decision \"exemplifies the court's troubling tendency to bend the rules when any effort to limit abortion, or even speak in opposition to abortion, is at issue.\"\n\nThe law, when first signed, cut the number of clinics from 40 to 20. Had it taken full effect, the 20 would have been cut in half. Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Women's Health, led the challenge against the law. \"Every day Whole Women's Health treats our patients with compassion, respect, and dignity \u2013 and today the Supreme Court did the same. We're thrilled that today justice was served and our clinics stay open,\" she said.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also commented on the ruling on Twitter, stating it was a \"victory for women in Texas and across America.\" Clinton added, \"The fight is not over. The next president has to protect women's health. Women won't be 'punished' for exercising their basic rights.\"\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights says the decision could have \"far-reaching implications.\" It represents \"a clear statement by the court about what the standard should be in these types of cases,\" said Julie Rikelman, director of the litigation group. Twenty-two states currently have facility requirements that are similar or the exact same as the requirements for ambulatory surgical centers. According to The Washington Post, the ruling will cast a \"long shadow\" among states with similar laws.",
    " Title: Study by Pew Research Center Finds Liberals Less Tolerant Than Conservatives on Social Media\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by The Pew Research Center has found that liberals are less tolerant than conservatives when it comes to social media interactions, based on the likelihood of unfriending or blocking individuals who express political views contrary to their own.\n\nAccording to the study, approximately 44% of consistent liberals on Facebook have blocked or defriended someone due to political disagreements, compared to 31% of consistent conservatives and 26% of all Facebook users.\n\nThe study also revealed other findings related to political polarization in the United States. Consistent liberals tend to be tightly clustered around a single news source, with 88% of consistent conservatives expressing trust in Fox News. They are also more likely to hear political opinions that align with their views when on Facebook.\n\nLiberals are more likely to have friends who share their political views, with 66% stating that most of their close friends share their views on government and politics. They also exhibit less media loyalty, relying on a broader range of news outlets, including those like NPR and the New York Times that others use less frequently.\n\nConsistent liberals express more trust than distrust in 28 of the 36 news outlets measured in the survey. They are more likely to block or defriend someone on a social network, as well as to end a personal friendship, due to political differences.\n\nLastly, liberals are more likely to follow issue-based groups rather than political parties or candidates on their Facebook feeds.\n\nThe study aims to gauge political polarization in the country and provides insights into the social media habits and news consumption patterns of different ideological groups.

    " Title: White House Communications Director Hope Hicks Resigns After House Intelligence Committee Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, one of U.S. President Donald Trump's longest-serving and most trusted aides, has resigned from her position. This departure marks a significant blow to the president, whose inner circle has been depleted by firings and scandals since he took office over a year ago.\n\nHicks, 29, announced her resignation a day after she spent nine hours in a closed hearing of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee as part of their investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders stated that Hicks' decision to leave was not related to her appearance before the panel.\n\nPresident Trump called Hicks \"a truly great person\" whom he would miss having at his side. Hicks, who served as Trump's spokeswoman during the 2016 election campaign, reportedly answered House panel questions on Tuesday about her time with the campaign and the transition months between the November election and the January 2017 inauguration.\n\nHicks' exact departure date is unclear, but she is expected to leave within the next few weeks. Hicks, who had no previous experience in politics, was one of the first people hired by Trump when he began his campaign for the presidency.\n\nHicks' role extended beyond steering messaging. She was a constant presence in Trump's orbit, sitting in on interviews with reporters and quietly guiding press-related policy while maintaining a low-profile. Despite her proximity to the president, Hicks managed to stay above the fray of staff backbiting and palace intrigue that has characterized the Trump White House.\n\nHicks was caught up in a controversy surrounding former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, another close Trump aide whom Hicks had been dating. She worked to defend him when charges of domestic abuse against his two former wives emerged. Porter ultimately resigned.\n\nAmong the issues Hicks declined to discuss with the House panel was her part in drafting a statement in July 2017 that misrepresented a July 2016 meeting at Trump Tower that included the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., other Trump associates, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Trump Jr. initially stated the meeting was about adoptions, but later revealed that Veselnitskaya had promised damaging information about his father's election campaign opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia ran a program of hacking and disinformation to interfere in the elections, and it later developed into an attempt to help Republican candidate Trump defeat Clinton. On Feb. 16, a U.S. special counsel indicted 13 Russians and three companies on charges of tampering in the campaign. Russia denies interfering in the U.S. election, and Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Moscow officials.\n\nHicks took over as communications director in September, following the difficult, 11-day tenure of Anthony Scaramucci, who was fired. She is credited behind the scenes for stabilizing the communications operation.\n\nIn a statement, Trump praised Hicks, stating, \"Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years. She is as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person.\" Hicks, in her own statement, expressed her gratitude to President Trump and wished him and his administration the best as he continues to lead the country.",
    " Title: Duval County Beach Reopening Sparks Debate Over Risky Activities and COVID-19 Restrictions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the city of Jacksonville, Florida, residents took advantage of the partial reopening of local beaches on April 18, 2020, amid coronavirus restrictions. The event sparked a national debate, with CNN airing a disapproving segment and the hashtag #FloridaMorons trending on Twitter.\n\nThe CNN report described the scene at Jacksonville Beach as not one of caution during a worldwide pandemic. People were seen swimming, biking, surfing, running, and fishing. However, none of these activities have been shown to be vectors for the spread of COVID-19, and no outdoor activities have been proven to be dangerous.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence linking outdoor activities to the disease, parks have been closed throughout the United States, with some closures enforced rigorously. Notable figures, such as Tom Brady and a Colorado father playing T-ball with his 6-year-old daughter, have been subject to enforcement actions.\n\nThe debate over the appropriate response to the coronavirus pandemic has been marked by a lack of distinction between risky and non-risky activities and between areas heavily affected by the virus and those less so. For instance, Duval County, home to Jacksonville, has had 17 COVID-19 deaths, a relatively low number compared to other counties in the United States.\n\nThe article suggests that a more nuanced approach to reopening areas, taking into account local conditions and population density, could help alleviate some of the controversy surrounding the pandemic response. The piece also highlights the need for flexibility in adopting a patchwork approach to opening up around the country.",

Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) withdrew his name from the House speakership election. The closed-door House Republican meeting, intended to determine a speaker nominee, spilled into the hallway outside the House Ways and Means Room in the Longworth Office Building.\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), a more conservative alternative running against McCarthy, described the announcement as \"absolutely stunning.\" He stated, \"Look, it was totally, it was just absolutely stunning what happened. Nobody anticipated that that was going to happen. I love Kevin McCarthy; he's a good man, and that was a tough thing to do, but God bless him.\"\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) offered his own account of McCarthy's decision: \"I am not the one\" is what he said. \"I am not the one to get to 218. I do not know if that was possible or not, he apparently decided he'd much rather stay as majority leader.\"\n\nThe House GOP announced the postponement of the speakership election, and speculation about potential new candidates soon followed. Some suggested a \"caretaker\" speaker\u2014an individual who would temporarily hold the position until new elections can be held in January 2017. This would likely be a senior member who would not run in '17.\n\nRep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) proposed that a caretaker would help the party \"stay unified in our basic principles.\" He suggested Rep. Hal Rogers of Kentucky as a potential caretaker, but Rogers declined the offer.\n\nRep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) addressed a potential compromise, an elephant in the hallway, which he said could be a \"very real possibility\" and a bipartisan coalition to elect the next speaker.\n\nRep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), another candidate running for speaker who was endorsed by the House Freedom Caucus, did not call for bipartisanship but instead for Republicans to \"come together and be a group.\"\n\nDespite the chaos, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) remained optimistic, stating, \"Again, we're in kind of, somewhat, chaotic territory, but we will find a way through this and it's going to be a way that serves our party and the American people the best.\"",
    " Title: Senate Report Alleges Obama Administration Granted Iran Access to U.S. Financial System Contrary to Pledges\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has released a draft report stating that the Obama administration granted a license allowing Iran to access the United States financial system, contradicting previous official pledges.\n\nAccording to the report, on February 24, 2016, the Treasury Department issued a specific license to Bank Muscat, authorizing the conversion of Iran's rials to euros through \"any United States depository institution.\" Despite this, U.S. government officials continued to testify in Congress that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system.\n\nSenator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), subcommittee chairman, stated, \"The Obama administration during the negotiation of the Iran deal misled the American people. I think they did so because they were desperate to get a deal.\"\n\nAt the time the Iran nuclear agreement was implemented, Iran had $5.7 billion in assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman, according to the subcommittee. Iran sought to access this money, and using the U.S. financial system for conversion was the most efficient means, even though U.S. sanctions prohibited it, according to the report.\n\nTwo U.S. banks were approached to execute the conversion, but they declined, citing the complexity and the unwanted appearance involved in processing an Iranian transaction, according to the report. Without a compliant American bank, a senior State Department official believed Bank Muscat and Iran eventually used European banks to convert the funds, according to the committee.\n\nPortman said his subcommittee began investigating the transaction last summer. In an interview with an unnamed senior State Department official, the panel said, the official acknowledged that the administration \"exceeded our JCPOA commitments\" because there was nothing in the JCPOA that required the issuance of the specific license, according to the report. (JCPOA is the acronym for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran.)\n\nA former administration official disputes the subcommittee's conclusion, stating that the Treasury Department never authorized Iran to access U.S. investments or markets, conduct commercial transactions in U.S. dollars, or open correspondent accounts at U.S. banks.\n\n\"This specific license can not be described as 'granting access to the U.S. financial system,'\" the former official said. \"This specific license was in fulfillment of JCPOA commitments to give Iran access to pools of its money held overseas. It was aimed solely to allow the movement of Iran's own funds stranded at an Omani bank into euros at a European bank, where Iran could then make use of them.\"",
    " Title: Former GOP Presidential Nominee Mitt Romney Refuses to Endorse Trump, Expresses Disappointment with Party\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has joined House Speaker Paul Ryan in refusing to endorse Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee. During a Q&A at a fundraising gala in Washington on Thursday, Romney expressed his disappointment with the Republican Party and declined to support Trump or Hillary Clinton.\n\nRomney ruled out the possibility of a third-party candidacy but stated that he could not support Trump in good conscience. He expressed his dismay at the state of American politics and wished for \"better choices\" that no longer exist.\n\nEarlier this year, Romney championed the Never Trump movement, attempting to block Trump's nomination by proposing the remaining Republican candidates unite to force a contested convention. However, the dream ended this week with Ted Cruz and John Kasich dropping out of the race.\n\nRomney praised Ryan, his former running mate, for his leadership in the House of Representatives. He expressed hope that Ryan would remain Speaker, despite the ongoing presidential race.\n\nRomney's public disavowal of Trump marks a significant departure from the Republican Party's support for their nominee. So far, there have been rumblings within the GOP that they could never support Trump. High-profile Republicans, including George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Senator John McCain, have refused to endorse or comment on the nomination. Senator McCain was recorded saying that Trump would severely hurt his re-election chances in Arizona, a Latino-heavy state that borders Mexico.\n\nFurthermore, Hillary Clinton highlighted in an e-mail blast that the anti-Trump sentiment is not limited to high-profile Republicans. Dozens of other GOP congressional representatives, governors, and major political figures are also quickly boarding the anti-Trump train or, at the very least, refusing to comment.",
    " Title: Atlanta Police Shooting: Autopsy Reveals Rayshard Brooks Suffered Two Gunshot Wounds, Death Ruled Homicide\n\nArticle:\n\nThe medical examiner in Atlanta has ruled the death of Rayshard Brooks, a 27-year-old black man who was shot by police on Friday, a homicide. The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office performed an autopsy on Brooks on Sunday and found that the gunshot wounds to his back caused organ failure due to blood loss.\n\nThe encounter between Brooks and two Atlanta police officers late Friday night, which was initially a routine sobriety check outside a Wendy's restaurant, escalated and ended in gunfire. According to police, Brooks appeared to be cooperating during the initial interaction, but the situation quickly became violent as they wrestled on the ground and Brooks took a Taser from one of the officers and pointed it at them. Seconds later, three gunshots were heard, and Brooks fell to the ground.\n\nAtlanta police released a video of the incident on Sunday, which shows the seemingly routine sobriety check that quickly spiraled out of control. The department has terminated Officer Garrett Rolfe, who fired the fatal shots, and Officer Devin Brosnan has been placed on administrative duty. Rolfe had been with the department since October 2013, and Brosnan since September 2018.\n\nIn related news, Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields resigned on Friday, following the shooting. Shields had been with the department for 25 years and was the first woman to hold the position of police chief in Atlanta.\n\nIn other news, China has locked down 10 more neighborhoods and fired officials amid a resurgence of the coronavirus. At least 10 residential communities near the Yuquandong market in Beijing's Haidian District were placed under lockdown after multiple cases were found over the weekend. Residents were ordered to go under home quarantine and take nucleic acid tests for the virus. All of the infections reportedly had ties to the Xinfadi market in Beijing's southern Fengtai district, which has been identified as the center of a new cluster of cases.\n\nIn the United States, the surgeon general, Jerome Adams, said wearing masks will give Americans \"more freedom.\" Meanwhile, the stock futures plummeted to begin the new week on coronavirus concerns.

    " Title: Supreme Court Allows Arkansas to Enforce Medication Abortion Restrictions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday granted Arkansas the authority to enforce a law restricting medication abortions, denying an appeal from the Planned Parenthood affiliate in the state. The high court's decision reverses a lower court order that had previously blocked the enforcement of the abortion pill rules.\n\nThe law in question requires doctors who provide abortion pills to hold a contract with another physician who has admitting privileges at a hospital and would agree to handle and treat complications. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had previously overturned the lower court's order, but put that ruling on hold as Planned Parenthood appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nPlanned Parenthood argued that if the law stands, Arkansas would be the only state where women would not have access to a pair of drugs that end pregnancies\u2014mifepristone, which makes it difficult for the fetus to attach to the uterine wall, and misoprostol, which causes the body to expel the pregnancy, similar to a miscarriage. Planned Parenthood offers these abortion medications at clinics in Fayetteville and Little Rock, but has stated it cannot find an obstetrician in the state willing to handle the hospital admissions.\n\nThe organization also argued that the law prevents women from obtaining medication abortions and would infringe on their right to an abortion, otherwise known as an undue burden. Undue burden is the standard set by the Supreme Court when measuring whether restrictions go too far in limiting women who seek to have an abortion. Critics of the law say it could end medication abortions in the state.\n\nIt is unavailable whether the legal battle will continue, but at this point, Arkansas is allowed to enforce the law. The law is similar to a provision in a Texas law, which the Supreme Court struck down in 2016.",
    " Title: Allegations of Sexual Misconduct: A Spectrum of Severity and the Dilemma of Zero Tolerance\n\nArticle:\n\nThere is a growing consensus that there should be zero tolerance for sexual harassment, exploitation, and violence of any kind. However, the application of this principle is proving to be a complex issue, with varying perspectives on its implications.\n\nRecent allegations of sexual misconduct have been levied against several high-profile individuals, including Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, Democratic Senator Al Franken, and numerous Hollywood personalities. These allegations range from inappropriate advances to rape.\n\nThe logic of zero tolerance often leads to every bad act being considered equally unacceptable. While it is crucial to address and condemn all forms of sexual misconduct, it is also important to recognize the varying degrees of severity. Rape is a criminal offense, while making a pass at an adult woman is different from molesting a minor. Groping a woman is not the same as raping a woman.\n\nThe problem lies in the conflation of these acts, with some media outlets and partisan groups lumping alleged miscreants together indiscriminately. This leveling is partly due to journalistic laziness, but it is also a result of partisan demagoguery and opportunism.\n\nPartisanship also leads to what can be called anti-leveling: people who ignore wrongdoing on their side while attacking their enemies. Some argue that Franken should resign, while others maintain that the people of Alabama should decide what to do about Moore.\n\nThe White House argues that denials should matter, and accusations without evidence should invite skepticism. However, this logic implies that alleged miscreants should simply deny wrongdoing rather than admit and apologize. This was seen in the case of former President Bill Clinton, who was initially given the benefit of the doubt until evidence forced him to admit some of his misdeeds.\n\nThe most dangerous and corrupting force in this situation is not the weaponization of bad behavior, but the weaponization of hypocrisy. The obsession with hypocrisy leads to a repugnant immorality, as partisans end up defending the underlying behavior itself in an effort to defend their team.\n\nAs the investigation and resolution of these allegations continue, the public is reminded of the importance of making serious distinctions in the severity of sexual misconduct and the need for a balanced approach to addressing these issues.",
    " Title: Judge Rules Paul Manafort Breached Plea Deal by Lying About Dealings with Alleged Russian Operative\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal court in Washington ruled on Wednesday that Paul Manafort, former presidential campaign chairman for Donald Trump, breached his plea deal by making false statements to Robert Mueller's inquiry team, the FBI, and a grand jury about his dealings with Konstantin Kilimnik, an alleged Russian intelligence operative.\n\nThe ruling means that Mueller's team is no longer obliged to endorse the lighter punishment that Manafort was promised for his crimes when he agreed to cooperate with investigators and tell the truth. Manafort, who denied lying, was found to have lied about three disputed issues: his interactions with Kilimnik, a payment he took from a pro-Trump campaign group, and another investigation that has not been identified.\n\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson, who issued the order, failed to establish that Manafort lied on two other subjects: his recent contacts with Trump administration officials and Kilimnik's role in a conspiracy to obstruct justice for which they were both indicted.\n\nMueller is investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, which US intelligence agencies concluded was aimed at boosting Trump's bid for the White House, and any coordination between Russian operatives and Trump's team. Manafort, 69, was accused by Mueller of lying about the fact he had shared polling data on the 2016 election with Kilimnik, a former colleague on election campaigns for pro-Kremlin politicians in eastern Europe.\n\nManafort is also said to have misled investigators about plans that he and Kilimnik were developing for a settlement relating to Russia's aggressive actions in Ukraine. Kilimnik, 48, trained at a university connected to Russia's military intelligence agency, formerly known as the GRU, which allegedly spearheaded the Kremlin's effort to disrupt the US election in 2016.\n\nMueller has also previously said that Rick Gates, Manafort's deputy on the Trump campaign, described Kilimnik as \"a former Russian intelligence officer with the GRU.\" Kilimnik denies that characterization. The special counsel moved to tear up Manafort's plea deal in November, alleging that the former campaign chairman had breached the agreement by continuing to lie. Mueller said the lies amounted to new crimes.\n\nManafort was known to have met Kilimnik twice during 2016. He passed the polling data to Kilimnik during an August meeting in New York, according to investigators. Mueller's team also found Manafort met Kilimnik in Spain during 2017.\n\nManafort's attorneys strenuously denied that he had intentionally misled the investigators. They said he could not remember some details and worked to promptly clarify any misstatements. His attorneys did not deny that Manafort gave Kilimnik the polling data, instead stating that he had not lied about it but was merely \"unable to recall specific details prior to having his recollection refreshed.\"\n\nAs part of the plea deal struck last September, Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the US and conspiring to obstruct justice, in relation to unregistered lobbying work for pro-Russian politicians. Other charges against him were dropped. By then, Manafort had been convicted of eight criminal counts in a separate fraud case brought against him by Mueller in Virginia.",
    " Title: California Chrome Allowed to Wear Nasal Strip in Belmont Stakes, Potential Triple Crown Contender\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia Chrome, the current favorite for the Triple Crown, will be allowed to wear a nasal strip during the Belmont Stakes on June 7, according to track officials. The decision comes after concerns were raised about the horse's ability to wear the nasal strip, which he has been using in previous races.\n\nThe nasal strip, a small adhesive strip placed on the horse's nose, is intended to help the horse breathe more easily. California Chrome has won six consecutive races with the nasal strip, and its removal could potentially impact the horse's performance.\n\nThe nasal strip controversy arose during the 2012 Belmont Stakes, when I'll Have Another, another California-bred horse, was prohibited from wearing a nasal strip. The decision was made by the Belmont's racing officials and the New York Racing Association, as each organization has the final say on whether to permit nasal strips.\n\nCalifornia Chrome's trainer, 77-year-old Art Sherman, expressed concern that the horse's owners might withdraw him from the race if the nasal strip is not allowed. The horse's co-owner, Perry Martin, has been a strong advocate for the nasal strip and has been pleased with the horse's success since it was first used.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes is the final and longest race of the Triple Crown, with a distance of 1.5 miles. If California Chrome wins the Belmont, he will join an elite group of horses that have won the Triple Crown, a feat last achieved by Affirmed in 1978. The Triple Crown consists of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes. California Chrome has already won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.\n\nThe Triple Crown winners to date are Sir Barton (1919), Gallant Fox (1930), Omaha (1935), War Admiral (1937), Whirlaway (1941), Count Fleet (1943), Assault (1946), Citation (1948), Secretariat (1973), Seattle Slew (1977), and Affirmed (1978).

The attackers exchanged fire with government forces, and the fighting continued for several hours. According to the assistant superintendent of police in the city, the shooting ended at approximately 8pm local time.\n\nA hotel security guard was reportedly killed during the attack, as confirmed by a spokesperson for Pakistan's military. A senior security official told the Associated Press that all four attackers were killed. Security forces cornered the assailants in a staircase during the hours-long gunfight, the military stated in its official statement.\n\nThe Majeed Brigade of the Balochistan Liberation Organisation, a separatist group active in Pakistan and Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter. The group stated that their fighters carried out the attack on Chinese and other foreign investors.\n\nThe Majeed Brigade has previously claimed responsibility for attacks on the Chinese embassy in Karachi in November 2020 and another assault on Chinese engineers in the Baloch district of Chagai.\n\nGwadar, a small city in Balochistan province, is the site of a large port under construction by a Chinese company as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a significant project of China's Belt and Road infrastructure-building initiative. Beijing has invested approximately $50bn (\u00a338bn) in the port and road links between Gwadar and China's western Xinjiang province.\n\nThe city of Gwadar, including its major hotels, is heavily guarded by the Pakistan army and paramilitary forces. Balochistan province is Pakistan's poorest and most restive, with Baloch separatists killing at least 11 members of the military in an attack in April. The founder of the Majeed Brigade, Aslam Baloch, was killed in a blast in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in December 2020, along with five other members of the militant group.",
    " Title: Former FBI Director James Comey to Testify on Alleged Pressure from President Trump over Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey is set to testify before the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee this week, facing questions about whether President Donald Trump attempted to influence an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The testimony follows Comey's dismissal by Trump last month, four years into his 10-year term as FBI Director.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, expressed interest in understanding the extent of any pressure or conversations Trump had with Comey regarding the Russia investigation. Comey is due to testify on Thursday as part of the committee's own Russia-related investigation.\n\nReports emerged after Comey's dismissal that Trump had asked Comey to end the probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn during a February meeting in the Oval Office, following Flynn's firing for misrepresenting his contacts with the Russian ambassador. The account, first reported by the New York Times, was based on a memo Comey wrote after the meeting.\n\nThe Comey memo caused concern on Capitol Hill and raised questions about whether Trump may have interfered with a federal investigation. Senator Warner stated, \"It would be unthinkable if the president actually did what was reported, asked FBI Director Comey to, in effect, back off of at least the investigation into General Flynn.\"\n\nThe potential for explosive testimony from Comey could significantly impact a sitting president, making Thursday's hearing a highly anticipated event. According to Linda Peek-Schacht, a political adviser who worked in President Jimmy Carter's White House, \"There are only a few times when Americans come together to watch one thing. Americans will be watching this.\"\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow attempted to influence the November election in Trump's favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in an interview that he does not have a relationship with Flynn and only spoke briefly with him at a 2015 dinner for Russian TV network RT.\n\nRepublican Senator Susan Collins, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, expressed eagerness to question Comey to gain more insight into Trump's claim that Comey told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Collins stated, \"We need to hear directly from Mr. Comey on these important issues.\"\n\nTrump has referred to the investigation into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia as a \"witch hunt\" designed to undermine the legitimacy of his electoral win. After reports that Trump asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein hired former FBI chief Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the FBI's Russia probe.",

Hannity took issue with The Washington Post's characterization of al-Baghdadi as an \"austere religious scholar\" in a headline, describing it as \"sick and repulsive.\"\n\nAccording to a U.S. defense official, al-Baghdadi, who took over as the head of ISIS after his predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi was killed in 2010, was located in a compound in northern Syria and was said to have detonated a suicide vest as U.S. special forces closed in. No U.S. Special Operations forces were harmed or killed during the mission, and President Trump claimed the operation had been in the works for several weeks.\n\nHannity described al-Baghdadi as an \"evil SOB,\" whom the might of the American military finally defeated. He wrote that The Washington Post needed to be \"educated\" about the horrors al-Baghdadi perpetrated upon innocent people.\n\n\"An 'austere religious scholar'? 'Dead at 48'? No \u2014 he was cornered by the greatest, toughest, best military heroes on earth! We killed the evil SOB. This is exactly why America will never trust these mainstream, corrupt, fake news outlets ever again,\" Hannity tweeted.\n\nHannity also claimed ISIS forces took pleasure in torturing their victims and shamed The Washington Post for trying to paint al-Baghdadi as anything other than a terrorist.\n\n\"ISIS terrorists take pleasure in beheadings and burning people alive in cages. They use cars and trucks to mow down innocent people.

The move was announced on Friday, with Napolitano stating that she has been nominated to lead the California university system.\n\nIn a statement, Napolitano expressed gratitude for her four-year tenure at DHS, during which she worked with the department's employees to protect the nation from harm. However, her tenure was marked by a series of lawsuits and controversies, particularly regarding the enforcement of immigration law.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents accused the department leadership of failing to properly enforce immigration law in a lawsuit. The complaint centers on the practice of using \"prosecutorial discretion,\" which allows department lawyers to selectively determine which immigrants to pursue for deportation and which to let go.\n\nNapolitano's department later enacted a Dream Act-style policy, granting young illegal immigrants a reprieve.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), one of Napolitano's chief critics, described her tenure at DHS as \"defined by a consistent disrespect for the rule of law.\"\n\nThe news of Napolitano's departure reportedly caught her staff by surprise. The secretary has been criticized for her handling of several high-profile terrorist incidents, including her comments on the attempted bombing on a Detroit-bound flight in 2009 and the Times Square bombing in 2010.\n\nNapolitano has been working with other agencies to address illegal immigration and natural disasters. Obama praised Napolitano for her service in a written statement, highlighting her efforts to secure the borders and her role in responding to natural disasters.\n\nNapolitano, a former Arizona governor, has led the Homeland Security Department since the start of the Obama administration.

    " Title: U.S. Surpasses Pre-Recession Jobs Total, but Recovery Remains Slow\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States reached a significant milestone on Friday as the monthly jobs report from the government revealed that the country surpassed the number of jobs it had before the recession began in May. The gain of 217,000 jobs brought the total U.S. payroll number to nearly 138.5 million jobs.\n\nHowever, analysts note that the recovery has taken more than six years and has excluded many workers. The labor-force participation rate, a widely watched barometer for how many people are actively participating in the labor market, held steady at 62.8% in May, near the lowest levels since the late 1970s.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 217,000 in May, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.3%. May marked the fourth straight month payrolls have increased at least 200,000, the first time that's happened since September 1999 to January 2000.\n\nBefore today's numbers were released, economists expected an increase in payrolls of around 210,000 jobs, according to a Dow Jones survey. The unemployment rate was expected to tick up a notch, to 6.4%.\n\nEconomists say some of the problems that are still holding the economy back include weak consumer demand that has crimped hiring plans, as well as employers who can't find workers with the right skills for their job openings. The picture has been bleak in California's San Joaquin Valley, where the dominant farm economy is blamed for low wages that leave workers unable to contribute to new growth in an area where unemployment rates are double the national average.\n\nHeidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute notes that despite approaching the milestone, it's not a time to celebrate. She states that the jobs recovery is the longest since before World War II, and while job growth has been steady, it's been too slow to absorb young workers who have come of age since 2007 and to help millions of other people who were laid off.\n\n\"We should have added around 7 million jobs\" in that time, Shierholz says. \"So, just getting back to where we were before the recession began nearly 6 1/2 years ago leaves us in a really big hole.\"",
    " Title: Gulf States' Refusal to Accept Syrian Refugees Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nFive of the wealthiest Muslim countries on the Arabian Peninsula, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain, have not accepted any Syrian refugees, citing the risk of terrorism as a reason. This contrasts with the United Kingdom, which has donated more than Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar combined in aid to Syrian refugees.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), between 10 and 12 million Syrians have been displaced due to the ongoing civil war in their country. Most remain within Syria's borders, but around four million have fled to neighboring countries, primarily Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon, and beyond.\n\nLebanon, which hosts 1.1 million Syrian refugees, closed its borders to Syrians in June 2020. Jordan, home to another 630,000 refugees, followed suit in August 2020, preventing more Syrians from leaving their country.\n\nBy early August 2015, European states had received nearly 350,000 asylum applications from Syrians, with nearly a third applying for asylum in Germany. Sweden and Serbia have received 65,000 and 50,000 applications, respectively. Hungary and Austria have received close to 19,000 applications each, while the UK is processing 7,030 applications, according to the UNHCR.\n\nThe decision by these Gulf States not to accept Syrian refugees has been met with criticism. Sherif Elsayid-Ali, Amnesty International's Head of Refugee and Migrants' Rights, has called their inaction \"shameful.\" He stated, \"The records of Gulf countries are absolutely appalling, in terms of actually showing compassion and sharing the responsibility of this crisis... It is a disgrace.\"\n\nNone of the Gulf States have signed the 1951 Refugee Convention, which legally defines a refugee as \"A person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality.\" However, they have taken refugees in the past.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, hundreds of thousands of Kuwaitis fleeing Saddam Hussein's invasion were given refuge. Arabian expert Sultan Sooud al-Qassemi noted, \"in Abu Dhabi, the government rented out entire apartment blocks and gave them to families for free.\"\n\nInstead of accepting refugees, these countries have opted to donate aid to those affected by the crisis. The UAE has funded a refugee camp in Jordan, providing shelter for tens of thousands of Syrians, while Saudi Arabia and Qatar have donated funds, food, shelter, and clothing to Syrians in Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan.\n\nTotal donations from the Gulf States are believed to total \u00a3589 million, less than a quarter of America's \u00a32.8 billion, and a fraction of the \u00a365 billion they spent on defense in 2012 alone. The UK has handed over \u00a3920 million so far, but the Prime Minister pledged to increase that figure to \u00a31 billion yesterday and promised to take in thousands more refugees.\n\nArabian expert Sultan Sooud al-Qassemi has argued that the Gulf States' standing in the world confers on them a moral obligation to step in. \"The Gulf States have emerged as the nerve centers of Arab diplomacy, culture, media production, commerce, and tourism, amassing an unprecedented degree of soft power unrivaled in the region and beyond,\" he said.\n\nThey also form \"the most influential bloc within the 70-year-old Arab League.\" Al-Qassemi further stated, \"But with great power comes great responsibility. The Gulf must realize that now is the time to change their policy regarding accepting refugees from the Syria crisis. It is the moral, ethical, and responsible step to take.\"",

President Donald Trump has tweeted that Russia should \"get ready\" for missiles to be fired at its ally Syria, while President Bashar al-Assad's government denies mounting a chemical attack.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the Syrian leader a \"gas killing animal\" and painted a dark picture of US-Russia relations but said it did not have to be that way. The US, UK, and France have not officially announced a decision on military action, but the US President's early morning tweets suggest a larger military operation may be forthcoming.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis said the US was still assessing the chemical attack and that the US military stood ready to provide military options if they are appropriate as the president determines. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said a final decision had not been made, and \"all options remain on the table.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said any strikes would target \"the regime's chemical capabilities.\" In the UK, Prime Minister Theresa May is reportedly considering joining military action in Syria without seeking parliamentary consent first.\n\nThe US Navy guided-missile destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, is in the Mediterranean Sea. Reports suggest that Russian battleships have left the country's naval base in the Syrian port city of Tartus.\n\nOpposition activists and rescuers say government aircraft dropped bombs filled with toxic chemicals on the town, the last major rebel stronghold near the capital Damascus. The Syrian-American Medical Society (Sams), which operates in rebel-held areas, and local aid workers said more than 500 people had been treated for symptoms \"indicative of exposure to a chemical agent.\"\n\nThe UN's World Health Organization (WHO) has demanded access to verify reports from its partners, which include Sams, that 70 people had died, including 43 who showed \"symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals.\" A team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is due to deploy to Syria \"shortly\" to determine whether banned weapons were used.\n\nDouma was under renewed assault from Syrian and Russian forces last week. Rebels have now been evacuating the town under an agreement involving the Russian military. The Syrian government has described the reports of the chemical attack as a \"provocation\" designed to justify Western intervention against its ally. It said on Wednesday that samples taken from the site had not revealed any chemical substances.\n\nSenior Russian figures have warned of a Russian response to a US attack. On Wednesday, Alexander Zasypkin, Moscow's ambassador to Lebanon, repeated a warning by the head of the military that missiles would be shot down and their launch sites targeted if they threatened the lives of Russian personnel. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova asked whether the aim of Western strikes might be \"to quickly remove the traces of the provocation...[so] international inspectors will have nothing to look for in terms of evidence.\"\n\nAddressing new ambassadors in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin said he hoped common sense would prevail and that the situation would stabilize. Mr. Putin said Russia would \"keep all its international obligations in full.\"",

This development has sparked concerns about the future direction of the world's second-largest economy.\n\nIn the past week, news headlines have been grim, with statements such as \"A cloud hanging over China's previously booming economy\" and \"The world's second-largest economy is running out of steam.\" These sentiments were accompanied by figures showing a decline in consumer prices and a potential drop in growth rates below 7 percent for the April-June quarter.\n\nWeakness has been observed in various sectors, including air travel. Brian Pearce, the chief economist at the International Air Transport Association, reported that air travel in China has experienced a significant decline. He stated, \"For a number of years, we were seeing growth rates of 15, 20 percent, but that seems to have slowed down quite sharply over the last year, and we're seeing growth rates down to single figures, which is quite strong for most markets, but for China, that's a pretty weak outcome.\"\n\nMost travel in China is for business, and many businesspeople are anxious. Confidence has weakened, particularly among smaller businesses, and export business has decreased due to problems in Europe. The government has tightened its grip on the housing market and public infrastructure construction, which has contributed to the current decline.\n\nWhen discussing China's economy, people often focus on exports. However, most of the factors driving the current decline are domestic. Andy Rothman, China macro-strategist for CLSA, an independent brokerage and investment group, asserts that the slowdown promised by the Communist Party is underway. He explains that China's blistering growth is no longer sustainable, and the government has been trying to slow it down and improve its quality.\n\nThe problem, according to Rothman, is that the Communist Party overdid it, tightening up too much in the housing market and on construction of public infrastructure. The government's restrictions on real estate sales have led to a decrease in demand for goods such as steel and concrete, hurting factories. The government is now encouraging home buying and approving new public projects to help stabilize the economy.\n\nIf the government does not implement reforms, China's economy will remain in a structural downshift for an extended period. Ren Xianfeng, a senior analyst with IHS Global Insight in Beijing, is optimistic about the next six months but pessimistic about the medium and longer term. She believes that China's economy needs serious reform, including building a more innovative economy that favors private firms and provides better financing options.\n\nAfter decades of spectacular growth, a prolonged structural downshift would be a significant shock\u2014one that no one wants to see.",
    " Title: Senator Richard Burr Sells Off Significant Portion of Stocks Amidst Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Richard Burr, the powerful chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, sold off a substantial portion of his stocks on February 13, unloading between $628,000 and $1.72 million of his holdings in 33 separate transactions. As the head of the intelligence committee, Burr, a North Carolina Republican, has access to the government's most highly classified information about threats to America's security. His committee was receiving daily coronavirus briefings around this time, according to a Reuters story.\n\nA week after Burr's sales, the stock market began a sharp decline and has lost about 30% since. On Thursday, Burr came under fire after National Public Radio (NPR) obtained a secret recording from February 27, in which the lawmaker gave a VIP group at an exclusive social club a much more dire preview of the economic impact of the coronavirus than what he had told the public.\n\nBurr's spokesperson stated, \"Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak.\" The spokesperson added, \"As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy.\"\n\nBurr is not a particularly wealthy member of the Senate, with a net worth estimated at $1.7 million in 2018, indicating that the February sales significantly shaped his financial fortunes and spared him from some of the pain that many Americans are now facing. He was one of the authors of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which shapes the nation's response to public health threats like the coronavirus.\n\nBurr's office did not respond to requests for comment about what sort of briefing materials, if any, on the coronavirus threat Burr may have seen as chair of the intelligence committee before his selling spree. According to the NPR report, Burr told attendees of the luncheon held at the Capitol Hill Club, \"There's one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history... It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.\"\n\nHe warned that companies might have to curtail their employees' travel, that schools could close, and that the military might be mobilized to compensate for overwhelmed hospitals. The luncheon was organized by the Tar Heel Circle, a club for businesses and organizations in North Carolina that are charged up to $10,000 for membership and are promised \"interaction with top leaders and staff from Congress, the administration, and the private sector.\"\n\nBurr's public comments had been considerably less dire. In a February 7 op-ed that he co-authored with another senator, he assured the public that \"the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus.\" He wrote, \"No matter the outbreak or threat, Congress and the federal government have been vigilant in identifying gaps in its readiness efforts and improving its response capabilities.\"\n\nMembers of Congress are required by law to disclose their securities transactions. Burr was one of just three senators who, in 2012, opposed the bill that explicitly barred lawmakers and their staff from using nonpublic information for trades and required regular disclosure of those trades. In opposing the bill, Burr argued at the time that insider trading laws already applied to members of Congress. President Barack Obama signed the bill, known as the STOCK Act, that year.\n\nStock transactions of lawmakers are reported in ranges. Burr's February 13 selling spree was his largest stock selling day of at least the past 14 months, according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 review of Senate records. Unlike his typical disclosure reports, which are a mix of sales and purchases, all of the transactions were sales. His biggest sales included companies that are among the most vulnerable to an economic slowdown. He dumped up to $150,000 worth of shares of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, a chain based in the United States that has lost two-thirds of its value. And he sold up to $100,000 of shares of Extended Stay America, an economy hospitality chain. Shares of that company are now worth less than half of what they did at the time Burr sold.\n\nThe assets come from accounts that are held by Burr, belong to his spouse, or are jointly held.",
    " Title: Political Strategist David Horowitz Outlines Strategy for Republican Victory in 2016 Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, political strategist David Horowitz outlined his strategy for the Republican Party's success in the 2016 presidential election. Horowitz, author of \"Take No Prisoners: The Battle Plan for Defeating the Left\" (Regnery, 2014), argues that the Republican Party will likely win the upcoming midterm elections due to six years of perceived radical policies under the current administration.\n\nAccording to Horowitz, the Democratic Party has shifted to the left, becoming driven by ideology rather than pragmatism. This ideological focus, he suggests, has led to policies that have negatively impacted the economy, healthcare, and national security. As a result, Horowitz asserts, the American people are disillusioned with the Democratic Party and will turn out in large numbers to vote against them in the midterms.\n\nLooking ahead to the 2016 presidential election, Horowitz believes that the Republican Party will focus on policy and maintain a positive message, while the Democratic Party will attack Republicans with moral indictments, portraying them as racists, sexists, homophobes, and enemies of the poor. Horowitz argues that the only way for Republicans to counter such attacks is to fight fire with fire, indicting the Democratic Party's moral character in response.\n\nHorowitz cites examples of the Democratic Party's perceived moral failings, such as their support for policies that disproportionately affect poor black and Hispanic children, and their failure to address issues of crime and violence in inner cities. He also criticizes the Democratic Party for not holding Al Sharpton, the President's chief adviser on race, accountable for his controversial statements and actions.\n\nHorowitz concludes by emphasizing the importance of a moral indictment in political warfare, stating that attacks on an opponent's character can be a powerful tool in winning elections. He warns that if Republicans fail to attack the Democratic Party in this way, they can expect to be attacked themselves.",
    " Title: Russia Increases Military Presence in Syria, Launches Naval Bombardment on ISIS Targets\n\nArticle:\n\nRussia has launched a naval bombardment on ISIS targets in Syria, according to a senior Russian official. The strikes, which took place on Wednesday, were launched from the Caspian Sea using long-range missiles that traveled 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) to their targets.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry reported that the strikes were aimed at Syrian targets. Wednesday's attacks also appear to mark new and closer military cooperation between Russia and the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nAccording to an opposition group, Russia and Syria launched coordinated attacks on Islamist factions in towns in Hama and Idlib provinces in western Syria. The Syrian shelling seemed to be conducted in concert with Russian airstrikes.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter described the Russian campaign of airstrikes in Syria as a \"fundamental mistake.\" The U.S. is not ready to cooperate with Russia on operations in Syria, Carter said.\n\nRussian airstrikes in Syria from September 30 to October 5. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov appeared to indicate that cooperation was in the works. He said Russia was prepared to take information and intelligence the U.S.-led coalition had obtained against ISIS, and he called on all sides to share targeting reconnaissance.\n\nThe U.S. military recently had to divert one aircraft over Syria to ensure it could maintain a safe flying distance from a Russian fighter. Until the two countries agree on mutual flight safety rules in Syrian airspace, U.S. pilots are under orders to change their flight path if a Russian plane is within 20 nautical miles, a senior defense official told CNN.\n\nRussian warplanes conducted heavy airstrikes on Wednesday on Islamist factions, accompanied by shelling from government forces, according to the UK-based, anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The head of the observatory said there were no ISIS positions in the areas targeted, and fierce clashes were taking place on the ground between regime forces and their allies and armed Islamist rebel factions, including the Ahrar al-Sham and al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front.\n\nWednesday's clashes are the fiercest in the last month, the observatory said. Syria's ambassador to Russia, Riad Haddad, said Wednesday that around 40% of ISIS infrastructure had been destroyed since Moscow's military operation began.\n\nHowever, Turkey, Syria's neighbor to the north, cast fresh doubt on whether Russia's goal was to go after ISIS. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that only 3.5% of Russia's airstrikes in Syria so far have targeted the terror group.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemned Russia's incursion into Turkish airspace. \"These air raids are not against ISIS. There were 57 air raids by Russian air forces. Fifty-five of them were against moderate opposition and only two were against Daesh,\" Turkey's Anadolu news agency quoted Davutoglu as saying, reflecting government thinking. Daesh is another name for ISIS.\n\nThe developments come a day after NATO's secretary-general expressed alarm over how the Russian military had grown on several fronts in Syria, including boots on the ground. \"So we have seen a substantial military buildup by Russia in Syria, both in the air with the combat planes and air defense systems, but also an increasing number of ground troops,\" Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. \"In addition to that, they have deployed naval assets, a large number of naval assets close to the Syrian shores.\"\n\nRussian planes have also incurred into Turkish airspace twice, he said. \"It's unacceptable, it's dangerous, and it's reckless behavior and it adds to the tensions,\" Stoltenberg told CNN. Stoltenberg said he doubted that Russia was interested primarily in fighting ISIS. \"I'm also concerned that Russia is not targeting ISIL but instead attacking the Syrian opposition and civilians,\" he said.",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Discusses Coronavirus Progress, Testing, and Economic Relief\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, Vice President Mike Pence discussed the country's progress in the battle against the coronavirus. The interview took place on Friday, following a rapid COVID-19 test for the reporter.\n\nWhen asked about the timeline for returning to normal after the April 30th guidelines, Pence stated, \"We're seeing real progress. We're going to be following the data very carefully, but if, as some of the experts suggest, if we are nearing the peak of the coronavirus and if Americans continue to do what they've been doing now for weeks across the country\u2026 we believe we'd be in a very different place come the end of April and we'll be able to bring forward recommendations.\"\n\nPence also addressed the initial lag in testing due to bureaucratic red tape, stating that the administration is now working closely with the private sector to improve testing capabilities. He highlighted the new 15-minute test developed by Abbott Laboratories, which is being made available across the country.\n\nRegarding religious services, Pence acknowledged that most places of worship have complied with social distancing guidelines, with doors remaining closed. He encouraged continued financial support for religious institutions during this critical time.\n\nOn the economic front, Pence praised the bipartisan cooperation in Congress, stating that relief is on the way. He mentioned direct payments to families and the paycheck protection program for small businesses as key components of the relief efforts.\n\nWhen asked about the ongoing debate over nationwide mail-in balloting, Pence did not reveal the administration's game plan, stating, \"Our objective right now is to put the coronavirus in the past.\"\n\nAs the leader of the Coronavirus Task Force, Pence expressed optimism about the future, stating, \"I believe there will indeed be light at the end of this very dark and tumultuous tunnel.\"",
    " Title: Alaska Legislature Averts Obamacare Collapse with $55 Million Insurance Fund\n\nArticle:\n\nAlaska, one of the most Republican-leaning states in the U.S., is taking steps to prevent the collapse of its Obamacare insurance marketplace. A bill, passed by the heavily GOP state Legislature and awaiting the signature of Governor Bill Walker, sets up a $55 million fund to subsidize enrollees' costs as the state grapples with Obamacare price spikes and the departure of all but one insurance company.\n\nThe legislation, originally proposed by Walker, redirects an existing tax on all insurance companies to finance the fund. The bill aims to ensure that the 23,000 Alaskans enrolled in exchange plans will not lose their insurance. Moda Health, the sole remaining company planning to sell coverage next year, announced last month that it would pull out of the Alaska exchange.\n\nThe $55 million fund will help cover medical expenses for high-cost enrollees. However, the money currently goes into Alaska's general fund, and redirecting it to bolster Obamacare has sparked criticism due to the state's massive budget deficit.\n\nRepublican state lawmakers, who have sued Walker for expanding Medicaid under the health law, maintain their opposition to Obamacare. However, they argue that they are taking necessary action to prevent health insurance premiums from skyrocketing and leaving thousands of people without coverage.\n\nState Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) stated, \"What I'm getting \u2014 and I guarantee what the Alaska Legislature's getting \u2014 is constituents pleading with them for help.\" He added, \"There's been no state in the union more negatively impacted by Obamacare than Alaska.\"\n\nThe Medicaid expansion lawsuit, meanwhile, was dismissed by one court earlier this year, and lawmakers are considering whether to appeal. The state's efforts to prevent Obamacare's collapse are unique among states, as no other state is currently considering such a step to prop up its insurance marketplace.\n\nAlaska's high health care costs, historically some of the highest in the country, are attributed to factors such as physicians and hospitals being paid more compared to those in nearby states and difficulty accessing facilities in the rural state. Just a few severely ill patients have put a strain on insurers, with nearly 500 enrollees with severe medical conditions costing Alaska insurers about $59 million in less than two years, according to state documents.\n\nIf approved by the governor, the insurance fund will go into effect on June 30. The legislation also authorizes Alaska to apply for an Obamacare waiver that allows states to change pieces of the federal law starting in 2017 as long as those reforms meet certain requirements. State Sen. Cathy Giessel said, \"We're doing something to help Alaskans who need health care.\"",
    " Title: Journalist Endorses Bernie Sanders for U.S. President\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, a columnist has announced their endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders for the position of President of the United States. The columnist, who contributes to various outlets offering in-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews, and cultural commentary, has expressed their support for Sanders over his opponent, Joe Biden, in the Democratic Party nomination.\n\nThe columnist's endorsement of Sanders is based on the belief that it is crucial to vote out incumbent President Donald Trump in November. Polls indicate that Sanders leads Trump with a greater margin than other contenders, and Sanders currently holds the highest popular approval rating of any public official in America.\n\nThe columnist asserts that Sanders' integrity and credibility are essential attributes in challenging a president who is perceived as a constant liar, such as Donald Trump. Sanders' history, vision, and platform are considered well-suited to defeat Trump, with the ability to expose Trump's false populism, broken promises on trade, and continued support for wars.\n\nSanders' campaign platform focuses on addressing the fundamental challenges facing working people. Key aspects of his agenda include Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, tuition-free college, a $15 minimum wage, empowering workers and unions, comprehensive immigration reform, universal childcare, criminal justice reform, and more.\n\nThe columnist argues that Sanders will inspire young people to vote in large numbers, a crucial factor in defeating Trump. They also emphasize that Sanders has a proven track record of forging a coalition between the working class and the middle class, and of standing for diversity against division.\n\nComparing Sanders to Biden, the columnist notes that while Biden is a decent man, he has a different record on issues such as Clarence Thomas, the Crime Bill, the Iraq War, and affirmative action. The columnist suggests that Biden's record does little to address the pain of African Americans or working people in general, while Sanders' progressive policies are considered more effective in addressing these issues.\n\nThe columnist concludes by stating that Sanders represents the moral center, with policies such as health care for all, tuition-free college, and a Middle East policy recognizing both Israel and Palestine, being in line with this moral center. When asked for their endorsement, the columnist shared their concerns about pressing issues with Sanders, who confirmed his commitment to addressing these issues, among others.",
    " Title: Pope Francis Apologizes for Church Abuse Scandals in Ireland, Faces Accusations of Ignoring Abuse Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis, during a two-day visit to Ireland, expressed his apologies for the sexual abuse scandal within the Irish church and other abuses committed by the church, including at its so-called \"mother and baby\" homes. The pope made these statements in front of 45,000 supporters at the rain-soaked Knock shrine in the west of Ireland and at a later Mass in Dublin's Phoenix Park.\n\nHowever, the visit has been marred by accusations from a former Vatican official, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who claimed that Pope Francis personally ignored sexual abuse allegations against prominent US cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was forced to resign last month. Vigano wrote in a letter published in the National Catholic Register that he had informed Francis of the allegations in 2013, but that the pope responded by lifting sanctions imposed on McCarrick by his predecessor, Pope Benedict.\n\nThe Vatican has not commented on Vigano's claims. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar directly urged the pope to take action against abuses and ensure justice for victims worldwide. The pope met with eight abuse victims during his visit, including a woman who was assaulted by a priest when she was 13 and a man who was illegally adopted from a Church-run \"mother and baby\" home.\n\nAt a news conference in Dublin by the group Ending Clergy Abuse (ECA), victim Mark Vincent Healey criticized the pope's speech in Dublin as a \"total missed opportunity.\" Healey stated, \"We're still waiting. We're left with uncertain silence. When is he going to act? What is he going to do?\"\n\nThe pope's visit is part of the 2018 World Meeting of Families, a global Catholic gathering that addressed issues including the treatment of gay people in the Church. This is the first papal visit to Ireland since John Paul II spoke in front of 1.5 million people during a visit in 1979. The Church's role and standing have been badly dented by the abuse scandals, and the Irish have shed traditional Catholic mores, voting earlier this year to legalize abortion after approving same-sex marriage in 2015.\n\nIn Tuam, a town in western Ireland not far from Knock, hundreds joined in a silent vigil on Sunday in solidarity with victims of the \"mother and baby\" homes, institutions accused of being punishment hostels for unwed pregnant women. Significant quantities of baby remains found in makeshift graves at the site of one such home in Tuam last year shocked the country.\n\nMultiple probes in Ireland have found Church leaders protected hundreds of predatory priests, and former Irish president Mary McAleese revealed this month that the Vatican had sought to keep Church documents inaccessible to government investigators. The abuse scandals in Ireland are part of a worldwide crisis for the Vatican. A devastating report earlier this month accused more than 300 priests in the US state of Pennsylvania of abusing more than 1,000 children since the 1950s. The Pope is due to head back to Rome late Sunday.",
    " Title: Obama and Congressional Leaders Pursue Alternative Tax Plan as Fiscal Cliff Deadline Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing negotiations to avoid the fiscal cliff, President Barack Obama and Congressional leaders are reportedly considering a fallback measure to prevent tax increases for most Americans. This alternative plan may pass in the House with strong support from Democrats, as conservative Republicans have signaled their opposition to any legislation that raises tax rates for more than 1 percent of Americans.\n\nThe proposed plan involves extending the Bush tax rates permanently for income below $250,000, a position Obama has maintained for four years. In negotiations with House Speaker John Boehner, Obama had tentatively agreed to raise the threshold to $400,000, and Congressional Democrats have suggested they might go as high as $500,000 to secure a deal with Republicans.\n\nHowever, the rejection of Boehner's bill by Republicans on Thursday indicates that such concessions may not sway the antitax absolutists within the Republican party. Boehner's so-called Plan B would have extended the Bush tax cuts for income up to $1 million, but this was still too much for many of his members.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has not publicly indicated whether he would support this alternative plan. When asked before Obama's statement whether he would agree not to filibuster the stripped-down bill, McConnell responded with \"Merry Christmas.\"\n\nBoehner has not specified when or if he will call the House back into session, but a spokesman said late Friday that the speaker would return to Washington after the holiday \"ready to find a solution that can pass both houses of Congress.\"\n\nThe likely measure, according to Democrats on Capitol Hill, would extend the Bush-era tax rates for income below $250,000, increase the tax rate for capital gains and dividend income to 20 percent from 15 percent, and extend some other tax breaks. It would also delay the sequester, across-the-board spending cuts in military and domestic programs, and extend federal unemployment benefits for the estimated two million Americans who have been out of a job for long enough to exhaust their initial state aid.\n\nA spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in a statement: \"As a fallback plan to protect the middle class, Republicans should support passing a bill that extends tax cuts for families up to $250,000, extends unemployment insurance, and delays the so-called sequester while we negotiate additional policies next year.\"\n\nThe new bill would not, according to Congressional Democrats, put efforts in motion to achieve additional deficit reduction through overhauls of the tax code and spending for fast-growing entitlement programs, chiefly Medicare.\n\nThe upshot is that, for a second year, Obama has been unable to reach agreement with Boehner on a debt-reduction framework that would stabilize the nation's debt, which is growing unsustainably as the population ages and medical costs rise. Nor would the measure extend the nation's borrowing limit, which the Treasury will hit early in 2013. Obama had hoped for a deal that would include a debt-limit increase to avert the showdown that damaged the economy and both parties' public approval ratings last year.\n\nBy resorting to the stripped-down legislative option, Obama demonstrated that his and his party's priority is to prevent the Bush tax cuts from expiring for most Americans. However, he may be forfeiting some leverage in the coming fiscal battles early next year over extending the debt limit. Many Republicans are threatening to withhold support for increasing that limit without Obama's agreement to deep reductions in spending for Medicare and Social Security. By both sides' reckoning, Obama would have a strong hand in the debt limit debate if it remained tied to the tax issue, given Republicans' zeal to avoid tax increases.",
    " Title: U.S.-China Trade Deal Remains Unclear as Details Remain Vague and Verification Challenges Persist\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S.-China trade deal, referred to as \"Phase One\" or \"preliminary,\" has raised doubts about its ability to serve American interests. The lack of an English-language version of the agreement and the vague terms have led to questions about the common understanding of key terms in both languages.\n\nThe most detailed description of the agreement so far comes from the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office, which provides specifics about U.S. tariff reductions but lacks details about China's own pledges. The agreement does not specify the Chinese purchases from the United States, the timeframe for these purchases, or the specifics of China's structural reforms and changes to its economic and trade regime in areas such as intellectual property, technology transfer, agriculture, financial services, and currency and foreign exchange.\n\nThe Trump administration has acknowledged the challenges in addressing these issues, which lie at the heart of the U.S.-China technology and national security rivalries, as well as the purely economic rivalry. The administration has settled for a shorter-term, interim agreement due to the complexity of these issues.\n\nThe agreement also lacks details about a \"strong dispute resolution system that ensures prompt implementation and enforcement.\" If the United States does not insist on being the sole judge, jury, and court of appeals when dealing with Chinese compliance, the agreement's effectiveness in benefiting U.S.-based producers may be limited.\n\nThe political implications of the U.S. announcement are also puzzling. China's economy has taken a greater trade war hit than the United States, and the Chinese government is struggling to contain unrest in Hong Kong. The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will offset some of the China-related losses suffered by agriculture-heavy states crucial to President Trump's re-election hopes.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade deal's tentative and flimsy nature suggests it is likely to fall apart sooner rather than later. Additionally, U.S.-China decoupling will continue due to the unbridgeable technology and national security gulf between the two countries and the increased wariness of U.S.-owned companies about exposing themselves to China's lawless and unreliable government.",
    " Title: Tension Between U.S. and Russia Over Edward Snowden Threatens Obama-Putin Meeting\n\n Article:\n\n The ongoing dispute between the United States and Russia over the fugitive security leaker Edward Snowden has led President Barack Obama to consider cancelling a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Snowden continues to reside at a Moscow airport while seeking asylum, Obama may forgo a meeting with Putin, which was scheduled for June, according to The New York Times.\n\n Tensions remain high between the two leaders as Obama seeks a return of Snowden, while Putin considers allowing the government security whistleblower to stay in Russia. This escalating situation has created a rift between the U.S. and Russia amid broader concerns over arms negotiations, a missile defense program, and strategies moving forward on Syria and Iran, as reported by The New York Times.\n\n Initially, Obama had planned on the Moscow stop as part of a trip to St. Petersburg for the Group of 20 (G-20) nations. White House spokesman Jay Carney, when asked about the proposed trip, stated, \"I can say that the president intends to travel to Russia for the G-20 summit. I don\u2019t have anything to add to what we\u2019ve said in the past about that trip.\"\n\n Putin, who has criticized the U.S. amid the spying disclosures, said Wednesday he did not want to hinder dialogue, stating, \"Bilateral relations, in my opinion, are far more important than squabbles about the activities of the secret services.\"\n\n Critics of the White House's handling of the Snowden affair have urged Obama to take a firmer stance in bringing him home, suggesting that the president should consider relocating the summit out of Russia altogether. Senator Lindsey Graham, speaking with CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday, encouraged Obama to be more assertive with Russia. He has also suggested that Obama should boycott the Olympic Games set for Sochi in 2014.\n\n \"President Obama, should you go to St. Petersburg, Russia, for the G-20 summit if they give Snowden asylum and they don\u2019t change their policy toward Syria and continue to help Iran?\" Graham said on CNN. \"Should you go? My advice to you is I wouldn\u2019t go to St. Petersburg. I would ask for a change of venue.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Announces Executive Order for Paid Sick Leave for Federal Contractors, Expands Worker Protections\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's Labor Day announcement of an executive order requiring paid sick leave for federal contractors is the latest step in a broader second-term push to expand worker protections. Speaking at a Greater Boston Labor Council breakfast, Mr. Obama stated that the new regulation would offer approximately 300,000 people working on federal contracts the ability to earn up to seven days of paid sick leave each year.\n\nCurrently, federal law requires employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. However, the White House notes that 44 million workers, or 40% of the total private-sector workforce, do not have access to paid leave. Workers could use the paid time off under the Obama administration proposal to care for themselves or a family member or to deal with absences resulting from domestic violence or sexual assault. The provision is set to take effect in 2017, after Obama leaves office.\n\nIn addition, the Labor Department this week will publish a final rule prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against employees and job applicants who discuss their salaries. The goal is to provide \"a critical tool to encourage pay transparency and make it easier for workers to recognize pay discrimination and seek appropriate remedies,\" according to a White House fact sheet.\n\nThe president's pro-labor actions have increased significantly since his reelection. In a December 2011 speech in Osawatomie, Kan., Obama stated, \"This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and for all those who are fighting to get into the middle class.\"\n\nLast month, a federal court upheld Labor Department regulations that extend minimum-wage and overtime pay rules to most home-health workers, who previously had not been covered by the standards. In June, the administration proposed to more than double the weekly salary threshold \u2013 to $970 \u2013 that determines who is eligible for overtime pay. The Labor Department estimates the step would make 5 million more workers entitled to overtime pay.\n\nIn 2014, a Labor Department rule became effective that banned discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity in the federal contracting workforce. In 2014, President Obama also signed an executive order raising the minimum wage to $10.10 for all workers on federal construction and service contracts.\n\nAt least three motivating factors are apparent in the president's steps to aid workers. After his first term, Obama became convinced that the Republican-controlled Congress would not approve legislation he requested. So the president began using executive orders that help federal workers and lay the groundwork for wider adoption in the future.\n\nIn his 2014 State of the Union address, the president called for a \"year of action\" to build new ladders of economic opportunity. \"Some require congressional action, and I'm eager to work with all of you,\" Obama said. \"But America does not stand still \u2013 and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do.\"\n\nSteps to improve conditions for workers also help build a legacy for a president nearing the end of his term. Obama's early career was spent as a community organizer in Chicago with a special interest in helping those on the economic margins. So the labor issues have a special resonance for him.\n\nThe spate of pro-worker actions also comes in the context of the labor movement being an important Democratic Party constituency in the 2016 presidential election. It would clearly help protect Obama's legacy if a Democratic president followed him.\n\nHowever, White House relations with labor could use some attention. Labor leaders are unhappy with the 12-nation Asia-Pacific trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the White House has negotiated. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka is sharply critical of the pace at which the White House has acted on workplace safety regulations. \"We haven't seen the needed regulations to keep pace with the change in the environment of the workplace,\" he said. \"We kill 150 workers a day in this country. Doesn't that bother any of you?\"\n\nAt the recent breakfast, Trumka also criticized Hillary Clinton's strategy of not being specific about her views on the TPP trade deal. \"Candidates that try to skirt the issues, not talking about where you are on TPP, hurt you when it comes to activating the membership and the general populous,\" he said. \"They want to know where people are even if they disagree with you.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Pressures Senate Republicans on Supreme Court Nominee as Democrats Shift Focus to Senate Control\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama conducted a series of interviews with television stations from six states with incumbent Republican senators on Monday, aiming to pressure the Senate Republican leadership to schedule a confirmation hearing and vote on Judge Merrick Garland, his Supreme Court nominee. The interviews were held at the White House, and the states included Arizona, Iowa, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Wisconsin.\n\nJudge Garland, who has been waiting for seven weeks for action, is facing calls for the release of his office of professional responsibility records from his tenure at the Justice Department during the Clinton administration. A government watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, has asked Judge Garland to authorize the release of these records to allow citizens to evaluate his qualifications for the Supreme Court.\n\nDuring the George W. Bush administration, Senate Democrats used a similar issue as justification for blocking the nomination of conservative lawyer Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Democrats insisted on withholding a final vote until the White House released Mr. Estrada's working papers from his time at the Clinton Justice Department. The Bush administration refused to release those memos, and Mr. Estrada was also on the legal team for Mr. Bush that fought the Florida recount in the contested 2000 presidential election.\n\nDemocrats point to polling that shows Republicans such as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa losing support in their home states for supporting the blockade of Judge Garland's nomination. In a survey, 44 percent of respondents said they are less likely to support Mr. Grassley in November because he is blocking the Garland nomination.\n\nThe polling, funded by the Constitutional Responsibility Project and the League of Conservation Voters, found that 60 percent of Iowa voters, including 63 percent of independents, agree with the conclusion that Mr. Grassley is allowing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to dictate the Senate Republican position on the nomination, rather than acting as a leader as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said he is \"terribly disappointed\" in Mr. Grassley. Mr. Grassley has defended his stance against the Garland nomination as a principled move that will give voters in November a voice in choosing the direction of the court. Only two of the 54 Senate Republicans say Judge Garland should receive a confirmation hearing.\n\nConservative activists have expressed skepticism about Democrats' push for Judge Garland, with Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, stating, \"A Supreme Court with Garland would roll back our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, harm small businesses by empowering unaccountable bureaucrats at agencies like the EPA and legalize partial-birth abortion.\" The Judicial Crisis Network is airing a $500,000 ad campaign over the Senate's recess in key states to call attention to Judge Garland's record.\n\nPresident Obama nominated Judge Garland, 63, in March to fill the vacancy created by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. He is chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and has received bipartisan praise for his qualifications. Conservatives worry that replacing the conservative justice with Judge Garland would shift the balance of power on the evenly divided court in favor of progressives for years to come.",
    " Title: Study Suggests Fake News Impacted 2016 Presidential Election Outcome\n\nArticle:\n\nA team of researchers at Ohio State University has concluded in a new study that \"fake news\" stories may have significantly impacted the 2016 presidential election, potentially influencing the final result. The study, first reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday, aimed to measure the degree to which false news stories dissuaded voters who cast ballots for President Obama in 2012 from voting for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhile the researchers emphasized that they could not definitively say that fake news \"caused\" Obama voters to defect from Clinton in 2016, they concluded that these stories had a \"substantial impact\" on voters that may have been sufficient to swing the election to Donald Trump.\n\n\"Our analysis leads us to the conclusion that fake news most likely did have a substantial impact on the voting decisions of a strategically important set of voters\u2014those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012,\" the researchers wrote. They further stated that given the narrow margins of victory by Donald Trump in key battleground states, this impact may have been sufficient to deprive Hillary Clinton of a victory in the Electoral College.\n\nThe study, conducted by Richard Gunther, Paul A. Beck, and Erik C. Nisbet, involved a YouGov survey of 585 voters who supported Obama in 2012 out of a total sample of 1,600. The researchers asked these voters 281 questions that included fake news statements, two of which were negative about Clinton and one positive about Trump, and all of which were propagated by traditional and social media.\n\nThe researchers found a significant correlation between belief in the fake news statements and vote choice. Specifically, a much larger percentage of those Obama voters who did not believe any of the fake news statements voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 (89%) than those who believed one of the statements (61%) and those who believed two or three of them (17%).\n\nThe study also took into account other factors that could have dissuaded Obama voters from casting ballots for Clinton, including age, race, political identification, and gender. Using multivariate regression analysis, they found that belief in the fake news statements still accounted for a significant portion of the defections when other factors were considered, including the extent to which voters disliked Clinton or liked Trump.\n\n\"Former Obama voters who believed one or more of these fake news stories were 3.9 times more likely to defect from the Democratic ticket in 2016 than those who did not believe any of the false claims, after taking into account all of these other factors,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nHowever, the study emphasized that one cannot conclude from the survey that fake news caused Obama voters to defect from Clinton in 2016. It notes that it is possible a voter first decided not to vote for Clinton, and then in turn cited false stories in order to rationalize their vote.\n\n\"We can not prove that belief in fake news \u2018caused\u2019 these former Obama voters to defect from the Democratic candidate in 2016,\" the researchers wrote. \"But if these estimates are even remotely accurate as measures of the impact of belief in fake news on defections from the Democratic candidate, it is highly likely that this pernicious pollution of our political discourse was sufficient to influence the outcome of what was a very close election.\"\n\nThe researchers said making a judgment about whether the fake stories determined the outcome of the election would have required a larger survey sample. The study has not been published in an academic journal yet, but likely will be in the coming months.",
    " Title: High-Profile Feminism: A Look at the HeForShe Campaign and the Rebranding of Feminism\n\nArticle:\n\nEmma Watson, the acclaimed actress known for her role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter series, has lent her name and influence to the cause of feminism at the United Nations. In a speech about gender equality that received a standing ovation and has since gone viral, Watson questioned the demonization of the term \"feminism\" and extended an invitation to men to join the movement.\n\nWatson's speech, delivered during the launch of the HeForShe campaign, focused on the role of men and the rebranding of feminism. The campaign aims to engage men in stopping violence against women. Watson's speech has been shared by both \"E!\" and U.N. Women on their respective Twitter accounts, a rare occurrence for such speeches.\n\nIn her speech, Watson highlighted the importance of gender equality, stating, \"I think it is right that I should make decisions about my own body. I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and decisions that will affect my life.\" She also acknowledged the privileges she has experienced due to the gender equality ambassadors in her life, who have not limited her opportunities because of her gender.\n\nThe HeForShe campaign is part of a growing trend of high-profile figures lending their support to the feminist cause. Beyonc\u00e9, for example, has also publicly identified as a feminist and argued for equal pay and respect for women. In 2014, she wrote a piece for the Shriver Report, stating, \"Equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect.\"\n\nHowever, translating this high-profile support into tangible progress has been a challenge. In media, women are underrepresented, with fewer women appearing as sources or in authoritative roles in news stories. In entertainment, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media found that there are 2.24 male characters for every female character in recently released films. Economically, the women's-to-men's earnings ratio has decreased after peaking in 2005 and 2006.\n\nThe challenge now is to turn the talk about gender equality into actionable change. The rebranding of feminism by cultural luminaries is commendable, but more progress is needed to achieve visible, on-the-ground gains in the lives of ordinary women and men. The HeForShe campaign, with its focus on engaging men in the movement, may be a step in the right direction. It will take a concerted effort from a village, boosted by high-wattage celebrities, to create a fairer world for everyone.",
    " Title: U.S.-Iran Tensions Escalate: Analysis of Recent Events and Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent incidents of tanker attacks and nuclear activities in the Middle East have raised concerns about the escalating tensions between the United States and Iran. The damage to the tankers and Iran's alleged violations of the Iran nuclear pact have been described as measured provocations, with the U.S. and Iran seemingly engaging in a delicate dance that could potentially lead to escalation.\n\nPresident Trump described the damage to the tankers as \"very minor,\" and he appears to recognize the danger of further escalation. However, the U.S. has deployed an additional 2,500 troops to the region, and there have been calls for military action against Iran. If the U.S. were to strike Iran, it is expected that Iran would respond in kind.\n\nBrett McGurk, a national security expert and former presidential envoy, warned that the administration's Iran policy may soon leave Trump with few options: either back down or resort to military action. The concern is that the U.S. administration's approach to Iran has been ineffective, and Trump may be \"boxed in.\"\n\nFurthermore, there are concerns that the U.S. is conflating Shiite Iran with the Sunni Taliban. Members of Congress fear that this is an attempt to provide Trump with legal cover to attack Iran under the 2001 authorization for the use of military force against Al Qaeda and its offshoots.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has offered a 12-point plan for Iran, which has been criticized as unrealistic and akin to a demand for Iran to surrender. The international community, including U.S. allies, has expressed growing distrust towards America due to the administration's incompetent bullying tactics in attempting to enforce Iran sanctions.\n\nAs the situation remains volatile, there are few good options available. Some experts suggest an international force to protect tankers might help, along with secret diplomacy to explore the possibility of reviving the nuclear deal in a manner acceptable to both sides. However, the prospects of such a resolution appear slim.",
    " Title: Israeli Intelligence Minister Denies Knowledge of Trump's Alleged Assassination Order for Syrian President\n\nArticle:\n\nIsrael's Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz has stated that he has no knowledge of U.S. President Donald Trump ever ordering the killing of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, contradicting claims made in a new book by Watergate reporter Bob Woodward.\n\nIn his book, \"Fear: Trump in the White House,\" Woodward alleges that Trump told his defense secretary he wanted to have Assad assassinated in response to a chemical attack on Syrian civilians in April 2017. The book claims that Defense Secretary James Mattis responded by saying he would \"get right on it,\" but instead developed a plan for a limited air strike that did not threaten Assad personally.\n\nTrump has since denied the quotes attributed to Mattis, calling them \"made up frauds, a con on the public.\" Mattis dismissed the book as \"a uniquely Washington brand of literature.\"\n\nIn response to these allegations, Katz told Tel Aviv radio station 103 FM, \"I do not know of any such instruction. He (Trump) is also denying it.\"\n\nIsrael, while neutral on the 7-year Syrian civil war, has carried out numerous air strikes against suspected attempts by Assad's Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah allies to establish permanent posts or advanced arms. Katz stated, \"In any event, what can be said is that in the framework of the coordination between the United States and Israel... the subject of the Syrian regime is certainly part of the discussions. Israel did not take a decision to topple Assad.\"\n\nUnder decades of Assad family rule, Syria has maintained a Cold War-style hostility toward Israel. Katz added, \"Of course his (Assad's) actions are terrible actions, and something that we abhor and condemn. Those opposing him, ISIS and others, are not a side that we think are better. We took care to preserve our interests.\"\n\nWoodward gained national fame for his reporting on the Watergate scandal in the 1970s and has since written a number of books that provide behind-the-scenes glimpses of presidential administrations and other Washington institutions. For this book, Woodward spoke to top aides and other insiders with the understanding that he would not reveal how he got his information, according to The Washington Post, which published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.",
    " Title: Israel Clarifies Airstrikes in Syria as Targeting Hezbollah, Not Assad Regime\n\nArticle:\n\nIsrael has sought to play down the recent airstrikes in Syria, emphasizing that the attacks were aimed at Hezbollah, not the Syrian regime. Following the airstrikes on Friday and Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's confidante, Tzachi Hanegbi, stated that the aim was to avoid escalating tensions with Syria, clarifying that any activity is only against Hezbollah, not the Syrian regime.\n\nHezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group that seeks Israel's elimination, has historically relied on the Assad regime to transfer weapons from Iran into its own hands. The relationship between Damascus and Hezbollah appears to have grown closer as a result of Syria's civil war, with Hezbollah fighters battling the Syrian opposition from within the country.\n\nIsrael's government reportedly informed President Bashar al-Assad through diplomatic channels that the attacks were not intended to influence the outcome of Syria's civil war. Israeli officials did not immediately confirm the report, but one suggested that such indirect contacts were not necessary.\n\nNetanyahu left for a diplomatic trip to China on Sunday, which was described as part of Israel's effort to send a calming message to Assad. Israel will continue to maintain official silence about the two air strikes, with a senior Israeli official stating that the goal is to make clear to Assad that Israel's sole interest is in preventing advanced weaponry from reaching Hezbollah.\n\nThe Sunday airstrike hit a military facility near the presidential palace in Damascus, resulting in the deaths of dozens of elite troops, according to a Syrian official. A military hospital doctor reported at least 100 deaths and scores more injuries. Although Israel did not comment on the attacks, Israeli analysts suggest that they were likely targeting weapons meant to be transferred from the Syrian military to Hezbollah.\n\nSyrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad told CNN that the Israeli strikes were \"a declaration of war\" and that Syria would respond. However, neither Syria nor Israel seem to desire a fresh conflict, as the next encounter promises to be more destructive than the 2006 war. Israeli security analyst Reuven Pedhazur told the Monitor that Syria and Hezbollah are unlikely to be willing to retaliate, even symbolically, as Israel will respond in kind.",
    " Title: Former U.S. State Department and Pentagon Officials Sign Statement Criticizing Trump's Decision to Revoke John Brennan's Security Clearance\n\nArticle:\n\nMore than 175 former U.S. State Department and Pentagon officials have added their names to a statement signed by former national security officials criticizing President Donald Trump's decision to cancel the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan. The new signatories to the statement, initially issued last week by 15 former directors and deputy chiefs of the Central Intelligence Agency and Office of Director of National Intelligence, include former political appointees and career civil servants who have worked under both Democratic and Republican presidents.\n\nAmong the most prominent individuals to sign a new version of the statement released on Monday by senior officials from the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations are former NATO Commander Admiral James Stavridis, former Deputy Secretaries of State Anthony Blinken and William Burns, and former Undersecretaries of State Nicholas Burns, Wendy Sherman, and Thomas Pickering.\n\nWhile they may not agree with all Brennan's public attacks on Trump, the statement reads, they believe \"the country will be weakened if there is a political litmus test applied\" before former officials are allowed to voice their views.\n\nSeparately, U.S. Senator Mark Warner, the Democratic vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, filed legislation on Monday that would limit the president's ability to revoke an individual's security clearance.\n\nTrump said last week he was considering withdrawing clearances for other former high-ranking officials as well as Bruce Ohr, a current Justice Department official. Brennan, who has publicly characterized Trump's comments at a recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin as \"treasonous,\" has said he might sue the Trump administration over the revocation of his clearance.\n\nRepresentatives Elijah Cummings and Stephen Lynch, top Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, in a letter on Monday to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, questioned the security clearance of John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser. Cummings and Lynch asked Kelly to turn over documents related to whether Bolton, in security clearance forms or \"other White House vetting materials,\" reported that in 2013 he participated by video in a roundtable discussion on gun rights organized by Maria Butina.\n\nButina was arrested in July and accused of acting as a Russian agent while developing ties with U.S. citizens and infiltrating political groups. The Washington Post has reported that Bolton recorded the video promoting an expansion of gun rights in Russia used by Right to Bear Arms, a group Butina formed.\n\nThe White House National Security Council had no immediate comment on the letter. White House aides also declined to comment. Russia has denied any interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump has said there was no collusion with his campaign.\n\n\"Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance, it's worth great prestige and big dollars, even board seats, and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan,\" Trump said in a series of posts on Twitter.",
    " Title: Joe Biden Outlines Policy Proposals to Address Racial Inequality and Systemic Racism\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, has outlined a series of policy proposals aimed at addressing racial inequalities and systemic racism in the United States.\n\nIn a speech, Biden stated, \"We know the nation we want to be. Now we have to deliver on this moment to achieve fundamental changes that address racial inequalities and white supremacy in our country.\"\n\nBiden criticized President Donald Trump's rhetoric, stating that it inflames racial divides in the country. He emphasized the need to root out systemic racism across laws and institutions and ensure black Americans have equal opportunities.\n\nOne of the proposals Biden supports is enhancing penalties for making false 911 calls based on race, gender, or religion. He also suggested prioritizing support for mission-driven lenders in low-income communities, expanding the New Markets Tax Credit Program, and expanding programs at the Small Business Administration that are effective in helping launch black-owned businesses.\n\nHousing discrimination is another area of concern for Biden. He highlighted the gap between African American and white homeownership and proposed giving local officials the tools to combat gentrification, end discriminatory lending practices, and eliminate exclusionary zoning laws.\n\nBiden also addressed education, advocating for improving teacher diversity, solving the student debt crisis, and investing in historically underfunded institutions like historically black colleges and universities.\n\nIn terms of police reform, Biden supports banning chokeholds, ensuring independent prosecutors in police-involved killings, collecting data regarding police use of force, and requiring training for officers regarding racial and religious bias and their duty to intervene if another officer is abusing power. He also proposed an additional $300 million for community policing.\n\nBiden also emphasized the need for investments in mental health services, drug treatment, and services for people experiencing homelessness. He suggested that social service providers could respond to calls with police officers in some situations.\n\nBiden concluded, \"We do not need a campaign, we need Biden to be a shadow president. Nothing about this fight will be easy. It will take leadership at the highest levels of our government\u2014and sustained grassroots pressure from communities who will no longer stand by silently when injustices are inflicted on people of color.\"",
    " Title: Minnesota Senator Al Franken Remains Unopposed by Republicans in 2014 Re-election Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nMinnesota Senator Al Franken, who won his seat in 2009 by a narrow margin of 312 votes, has yet to draw a Republican opponent for his 2014 re-election bid. The Republican Party, which initially targeted Franken as a top pickoff target, now faces a recruitment challenge in finding a strong candidate to challenge the incumbent Democrat.\n\nThe GOP's struggle to find top-tier candidates in several states, including Minnesota, speaks to the broader recruitment challenge Republicans face in 2014. To overcome the Democrats' 10-seat Senate advantage, the GOP needs to expand the map by putting seats like Franken's in play. However, the party has yet to find strong candidates in several states that should, at least on paper, be competitive.\n\nSenators Mark Udall of Colorado and Tom Udall of New Mexico, who were elected in 2008, are considered safe. No top-tier GOP candidate has announced yet in Michigan, New Hampshire, or Iowa. Democrats are defending seats in seven red states carried by Mitt Romney last year, but it is highly unlikely that Republicans will run the table in those places.\n\nFranken, the former \"Saturday Night Live\" star and liberal talk show host, has worked hard to position himself as a serious lawmaker. He has kept a low profile, largely avoided national press, and focused on populist issues like privacy and consumer protection. Franken has cultivated a reputation as a serious lawmaker and has amassed a formidable war chest.\n\nMinnesota, which was genuinely purple a decade ago, has taken on a more bluish hue. The state Republican Party is reeling, debt-ridden, and seeking to find its way after its Ron Paul-affiliated Senate nominee lost to Sen. Amy Klobuchar by 34 points in November.\n\nPolling released last week shows Franken's approval rating just above the 50 percent threshold, a key metric for an incumbent. The Democratic firm Public Policy Polling showed him starting with a double-digit lead over six potential Republican candidates.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota political scientist Larry Jacobs commented, \"It's shocking to me that Franken is as safe as he is at this point.\"\n\nRepublicans hope national atmospherics, specifically the growing unpopularity of Obamacare and the scandals enveloping President Obama, will help put Minnesota in play. They believe 2014 will be a bad year for incumbents in general, and that while Franken is no doubt the favorite at the moment, the race is not lost for the GOP.\n\nKnowing he would have a tough race, Franken hired a campaign manager early and started fundraising aggressively. He brought in $2 million in the first quarter and has about that much cash on hand. Franken's campaign manager, Matt Burgess, stated, \"My mantra is to be prepared and ready for anything.\"",
    " Title: Meg Whitman Suggests Possible Endorsement of Hillary Clinton Over Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a private meeting held in Park City, Utah, Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman reportedly expressed reservations about supporting Donald Trump's presidential bid, suggesting the possibility of endorsing Hillary Clinton instead. According to John Chachas, a GOP donor who attended the event, Whitman posed the question, \"Is it not reasonable to support Hillary Clinton?\" given Trump's controversial statements.\n\nDuring the meeting, Whitman reportedly compared Trump to both Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, according to anonymous attendees speaking to Politico. However, in subsequent interviews, Whitman did not fully endorse Clinton, stating that she had not made a decision yet and would wait to see who the vice presidential picks are before making a final decision.\n\nWhitman, 59, served as CEO of eBay for a decade starting in 1998 before taking on the same role at HP in 2011. She unsuccessfully ran for governor of California against Democratic incumbent Jerry Brown in 2010, setting a record for the most money ever spent by a political candidate on a single election, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nWhitman advised Mitt Romney during his 2012 campaign to prevent President Obama's re-election and supported New Jersey Governor Chris Christie before he dropped out of the GOP race earlier in the election season. As of last June, Forbes estimated Whitman's net worth to be approximately $2.1 billion.\n\nIn response to Whitman's potential endorsement, Trump reportedly stated, \"I never met Meg Whitman, but the job she is doing at Hewlett-Packard is not a very good one.\" Trump added, \"Based on the disastrous campaign she ran in California, and the tens of millions of dollars she wasted, I have learned a lot from her. I do not want her support.\"\n\nA previous report erroneously stated that the meeting was held in Washington, D.C.",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Debate Focuses on Donald Trump's Remarks on Islam\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest Republican presidential debate, hosted by CNN, took place on Thursday, with a significant portion of the discussion centered on the comments made by Donald Trump regarding Islam and Muslims. The debate, which was criticized for its bombastic and condescending presentation, did not result in any significant changes to the current political landscape.\n\nDuring the debate, Trump reiterated his controversial stance on Islam, stating, \"I think Islam hates us. There's something there that\u2014there's a tremendous hatred there. We have to get to the bottom of it.\" When given an opportunity to clarify his remarks, Trump refused to distinguish between radical and non-radical interpretations of Islam.\n\nIn response to Trump's comments, Marco Rubio offered a tepid critique, stating that presidents cannot say anything they want. Rubio added that he was not interested in being politically correct, but that there were pragmatic reasons not to dehumanize 1.6 billion people.\n\nThe Intercept's Murtaza Hussain noted that this exchange was significant because it was not just about Trump, but about the entire Republican Party and the millions of Americans who continue to support it. The debate, as observed by people worldwide, presents a perception of the United States that may influence the opinions of those who are not yet set in their views of the country.",
    " Title: China's Economic Slowdown: A Period of Significant Change and Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nChina's economic outlook is facing challenges, as stock prices have been declining since the spring due to investor concerns about a potential weakening economy, including the risk of a \"hard landing\" for China. This economic slowdown could have a ripple effect on the global economy, contributing to recent downturns in U.S. stock markets.\n\nHowever, some economists argue that a severe economic downturn, or \"hard landing,\" may not occur. Instead, they suggest that the Chinese economy is cooling rather than plummeting. The slowdown was, in part, necessary and inevitable, as China's growth had been rooted in unsustainable investment in factories, property, and other fixed assets.\n\nMoreover, the popular view of China as an unstoppable economic giant was never entirely accurate. The market plunge may prompt people to take a more realistic view that incorporates China's weaknesses and the transition from its high-growth era to the likelihood of slower growth in the future.\n\nThe economic challenges in China also present potential risks for political unrest, with reported signs of tension within the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). President Xi Jinping is pursuing sweeping economic changes alongside an avowed crackdown on official corruption.\n\nDespite the short-term turmoil, many China watchers argue that a successful outcome would be if the economic bumps become steps along Xi's route to an economy that emphasizes freer markets and more domestic consumption, rather than growth fueled by exports and government-led investment.\n\nChina's economic slowdown could also have implications for the rest of the world, particularly neighboring Asian nations. If China's economy is slowing more than expected, it could pull some wind out of the world economy.\n\nEconomists are not necessarily adopting \"hard-landing\" forecasts for China. Julian Jessop of the forecasting firm Capital Economics in London wrote in a Monday analysis that the recent economic data from China \"are not weak enough to justify fears of a 'hard landing,' especially with the full impact of policy stimulus yet to come through.\"\n\nChina's policymakers have financial firepower at their disposal to do substantially more in the way of stimulus as needed. Kamel Mellahi, of Britain's Warwick Business School, expects China's economy to weather its current financial market storm. He believes that Xi's government is very focused on navigating the long-term reforms outlined by the CCP in the past few years.\n\nThese reforms range from an overhaul of banking rules to a new system of farm property rights, and other steps toward modern regulatory systems and better market-based allocation of resources. \"China is trying to calm the stock market and at the same time address short-term domestic financial problems,\" says Mellahi. \"But I don't think China is going to take major decisions that could jeopardize its long-term objectives.\"\n\nThe road ahead won't necessarily be smooth, and the current turbulence can be viewed as an early reminder of that. \"The Chinese economy will not, and should not, grow as fast as it used to,\" Mellahi says. \"The ultimate goal is to achieve a balanced, more sustained growth level.\"",

Trump tweeted, \"Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me 'old,'\" followed by, \"When I would NEVER call him'short and fat?'\"\n\nSome commentators, such as Ben Shapiro, have speculated that such exchanges could potentially lead to a nuclear conflict, with Shapiro tweeting, \"World War III began after a series of seemingly comic tweets escalated into a nuclear exchange.\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Kim Jong-un did not directly call Trump \"short and fat\" in his speech, but rather referred to Trump as an \"old lunatic.\" This mischaracterization was reported by The Guardian.\n\nPresident Trump has been advocating for global pressure against North Korea's nuclear weapons program during his Asia trip. In a speech delivered in South Korea's National Assembly on Tuesday, he warned, \"Do not underestimate us. And do not try us... The weapons you're acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger.\"\n\nIn response, North Korea's Foreign Ministry stated, \"Reckless remarks by an old lunatic like Trump will never scare us or stop our advance. On the contrary, all this makes us more sure that our choice to promote economic construction at the same time as building up our nuclear force is all the more righteous, and it pushes us to speed up the effort to complete our nuclear force.\"\n\nAt a news conference in Vietnam on Sunday, Trump expressed a hope for friendship with Kim Jong-un, stating, \"That might be a strange thing to happen but it's a possibility... If it did happen it could be a good thing, I can tell you, for North Korea, but it could also be good for a lot of other places and be good for the rest of the world.\"\n\nTrump and Kim have a history of exchanging insults and threats amidst escalating tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on September 3, prompting another round of UN sanctions.\n\nAs of now, it remains to be seen how these exchanges will unfold. It is crucial to approach such developments with a nuanced understanding, recognizing the complexities and potential dangers of the situation, but also avoiding speculation and fear-mongering.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Break from Obama on Key Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats have been publicly criticizing President Barack Obama on several key issues, deviating from their usual support of the president's legislative agenda. From trade to Iran sanctions, the Keystone XL pipeline, Obamacare, the National Security Agency, and energy policy, Senate Democrats have shown an unusual willingness to criticize the president, with minimal concerns about repercussions from the White House.\n\nLast week, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada rejected a bill to fast-track trade deals that is strongly backed by the White House, working against Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus of Montana, who has been tapped to be the president's ambassador to China.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) commented on the discontent among Democrats, referring to their criticism as similar to that of the Senate GOP campaign arm's aggressive anti-Obama messaging. Discontented Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia have criticized Obama's energy policies and his statements during his State of the Union speech.\n\nThe criticism from some lawmakers is predictable, with Democrats from energy-producing states criticizing the administration's energy policies and red-state Democrats up for reelection in 2014 concerned about Obamacare fallout. However, not all the criticism is coming from expected quarters, with liberal Democrats decrying NSA surveillance programs.\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), a persistent critic of the White House on NSA policy, stated, \"I think the framers did an incredible job of finding the right balance, so, we've gotten away from that. And when we get back to that, my outspokenness will diminish.\"\n\nThe rifts between Senate Democrats and the White House might represent poor message coordination and a White House that does not keep Capitol Hill in the loop. President Barack Obama does not have close personal relationships with most Democratic lawmakers, and his legislative affairs shop was criticized until the recent addition of longtime Hill staffer Katie Beirne Fallon.\n\nSen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) of Obama's outreach to Democratic senators commented, \"This White House has been very, how shall I say, it's not their strong suit to give anybody a heads-up on anything.\" Landrieu was angered recently by a surprise Statement of Administration Policy ripping her flood insurance bill, which would ease rate increases that would disproportionately hit flood-prone Louisiana. Obama's aides indicated the bill is not sound fiscal policy, though they notably did not threaten a veto of her bill.\n\nLandrieu stated, \"I believe in many of the principles of the Democratic Party. But I stay focused on the issues that are important to Louisiana. And when the president is for Louisiana, I'm for the president. When he's not, I'm not.\"",
    " Title: Media Bias in Identifying Party Affiliation of Scandal-Plagued Governors\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell's indictment on 14 charges, including conspiracy and fraud, the three major network morning shows, NBC, ABC, and CBS, immediately identified McDonnell as a Republican. This contrasts with the media's response to a similar scandal involving a Democratic governor, Elliot Spitzer of New York, in 2008.\n\nIn the McDonnell case, NBC's Today host Savannah Guthrie introduced the segment by stating, \"And now to that bombshell indictment of the former governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell, a one-time rising star in the Republican Party.\" ABC provided an on-screen graphic identifying McDonnell as a Republican, and CBS This Morning's Nancy Cordes noted that \"McDonnell was once considered a possible presidential contender for the GOP.\"\n\nIn contrast, during the Spitzer scandal, ABC and NBC failed to label Spitzer as a Democrat for two straight days in their lead stories. In 2008, my colleague Brent Baker noted that neither ABC's World News nor the NBC Nightly News verbally identified Spitzer's political party. On ABC, the only hints as to Spitzer's party were a few seconds of video of Spitzer beside Hillary Clinton as they walked down some steps and a (D) on screen by Spitzer's name over part of one soundbite. NBC did not even do that.\n\nIn total, NBC and CBS referenced McDonnell's Republican affiliation three times by name, whereas it took ABC three days to identify Spitzer as a Democrat in 2008, and even longer for NBC to do so. In fact, in 2008, both ABC and NBC found time to \"applaud his [Elliot Spitzer] reputation and effectiveness as the Empire State's Attorney General before becoming Governor.\" In contrast, both CBS and NBC noted how McDonnell is \"the first Virginia governor ever to be charged with a crime and the charges he's facing carry the possibility of decades behind bars.\"\n\nCBS's Nancy Cordes hyped how, \"It was not that long ago that McDonnell was considered a rising Republican star and possible presidential candidate in 2016,\" and ABC's Josh Elliott said McDonnell was \"once considered a possible presidential candidate.\" In contrast, in the first two days following the Spitzer scandal, NBC's Today ran seven Spitzer-related segments and one interview with then-candidate Barak Obama, without once mentioning Spitzer's Democratic affiliation.\n\nWhile both governors were embroiled in highly politicized scandals, the networks have made a concerted effort to let their viewers know when a Republican is in trouble but punt when it comes to identifying a Democrat. This practice by ABC, NBC, and CBS is nothing new and they will likely continue to rush to identify Republicans plagued in scandal while giving Democrats a pass.",
    " Title: Michigan Barber Compares Governor's Lockdown to Holocaust, Defies Shutdown Orders\n\nArticle:\n\nMichigan barber Karl Manke, who has gained national attention for defying Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer's coronavirus shutdown orders and subsequently having his license suspended, compared Whitmer's lockdown to the Holocaust during a protest in Lansing on Wednesday.\n\nDuring \"Operation Haircut,\" a protest inspired by Manke that featured barbers and stylists giving free haircuts in defiance of Whitmer's social distancing requirements, Manke spoke to demonstrators on the steps of the state Capitol. State police cited a number of barbers and stylists for their actions, according to MLive.\n\nIn his speech, Manke referenced a novel he wrote about the Holocaust that included factual accounts of Jews being tricked by Nazis to enter cattle cars, which took them to death camps. Manke stated, \"I refuse to get into a cattle car!\" He added, \"I will not stand down. I will continue my work with or without a license.\"\n\nA Court of Appeals panel has ruled that a judge should hold a hearing on the state's motion to temporarily close Manke's barbershop in Owosso and decide on the request by the end of the day Thursday, according to the Detroit News. It is unclear if Manke was among those who received citations.\n\nGovernor Whitmer stated earlier this week that it is \"unlikely\" that barbers, salons, and personal care services would reopen when the stay-at-home order expires on May 28, according to MLive. Republican state Sen. Kevin Daley received a haircut from barber Suzanne Dodoro during the demonstration, stating, \"We need to support the people making a living. We need to save life, but we need to save livelihood, too.\"",
    " Title: Tight Race for Congress Control: Democrats and Republicans Face Fundraising Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nThe race for control of the U.S. Congress is currently extremely close, with Democrats facing potential crushing defeats due to a wave of Republican funding, unless something changes before midnight. However, Republicans are also struggling to defend themselves against Democrats who are outraising them.\n\nIn the lead-up to Tuesday's federal elections, both parties are urging supporters to donate money to level the playing field with the other side's relentless funding from billionaire donors. This political environment, characterized by pessimism, has become a common theme in fundraising emails from both parties.\n\nHistorically, gloominess has been associated with the Democratic Party, but this time around, even Republican strategists like Karl Rove, who is known for his optimistic fundraising appeals, have adopted a more pessimistic tone. In an email to National Republican Senatorial Committee donors, Rove wrote that the midterm environment is toxic for Democrats, but there is a chance that Republicans may not take the Senate. He attributed this to the Democrats' significant fundraising advantage.\n\nThe desperation for funds is not limited to emails. Both parties are using data selectively to prove that they are losing the cash race. For instance, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has warned that billionaire donors like the Koch brothers are trying to buy the election, while the Kochs have insisted that super-rich liberals have a better political machine.\n\nRepublicans, despite forecasts showing they are likely to win major victories, are also resorting to desperate rhetoric. Mitt Romney, in a fundraising email for the National Republican Congressional Committee, stated that Republicans are being beaten up and cannot defend themselves due to the Democrats' outraising them.\n\nThe analysis of the most recent FEC reports by \u2588\u2588\u2588 shows that among the groups reporting the biggest political ad spending in 2014, the 15 top Democrat-aligned committees that disclose their donors have outraised the 15 top Republican ones $453 million to $289 million in the 2014 cycle. This contrasts with the recent Democratic Party fundraising emails that suggest the opposite.\n\nIn a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee email last week, signed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, it was stated that Democrats are facing opposition unlike anything they've seen, with right-wing billionaires going all out to buy the Republican election. The email further stated that the only way to withstand this barrage of corporate interest attacks is with supporters' donations. Two days later, a missive from the Democratic Governors Association lamented polls showing Democrats slipping, Republicans hammering them with brutal attacks, and a lack of funds to fight back.",
    " Title: Three Police Officers Killed, Several Wounded in Baton Rouge Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nThree police officers were shot dead and several others wounded in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on Sunday, according to the city's mayor, Kip Holden. The incident occurred as the country remains on edge following recent police shootings of black men and the killings of five Dallas officers.\n\nThe Baton Rouge Police Department issued a brief statement, indicating that they do not believe the shooting was race-related. The officers were responding to a call of shots fired when they were ambushed by at least one gunman, Mayor Holden told NBC News.\n\nOne suspect is dead, and police are using a robot to check the shooting scene for potential explosives, Baton Rouge Police spokesman L'Jean Mckneely said. Authorities are seeking more than one suspect and have asked the public to be on the lookout for individuals dressed in black and carrying long guns.\n\nEarlier, a spokesman for the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office stated that police and sheriff's deputies were involved in the shooting incident, which occurred around 9 a.m. local time. Multiple officers from both agencies sustained injuries and were transported to local hospitals, according to the spokesman, with no firm numbers available on the number of officers hurt or the extent of their injuries.\n\nThe scene of the shootings is still active, and police have warned residents to stay away from the area, near Airline Highway, which is a mile from the Baton Rouge Police Department headquarters, where dozens of protesters were arrested earlier this month. Two nearby hospitals were reportedly on lockdown, but efforts to confirm this report were not immediately successful.\n\nIt is unclear whether there is a link between Sunday's shootings and the recent unrest over police killings of black men in Baton Rouge and Minnesota. A wave of protests against police violence in Baton Rouge and other cities erupted after Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old African-American father of five, was shot and killed by law enforcement officers on July 5.\n\nIn Dallas, a gunman opened fire on white officers during a protest against Sterling's killing and a similar incident in Minnesota, resulting in the deaths of five officers. The Black Lives Matter civil rights movement has called for police to end racial profiling, bringing the issue to national attention ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe Justice Department, which has opened a federal probe into Sterling's death, declined to comment on Sunday's shootings. President Barack Obama has been briefed on the shooting of police officers in Baton Rouge and will be updated throughout the day, according to a White House official. The official added that the White House has also been in contact with local officials and has offered assistance.\n\nSocial media posts from Baton Rouge Police Chief David O. Brown and CNN correspondent Sara Sidner indicate that the situation remains active and fluid. The Associated Press, TODAY, CNN International, Al Jazeera News, Breaking News, and other news outlets are providing updates as more information becomes available.",
    " Title: Major Corporations Pledge Carbon Neutrality and More Ambitious Emissions Reduction Targets\n\nArticle:\n\nA growing number of major corporations, including Delta Air Lines, BP, Microsoft, Ikea, and Blackrock, are making lofty climate promises, with some vowing to not only become carbon neutral but to actively reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This trend is not limited to a few headline-grabbing outliers, as more companies are disclosing their carbon emissions and setting emissions reduction targets, according to the global nonprofit CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project).\n\nThe intensity of these commitments is rising, according to Engie Impact, a sustainability company tied to a French energy group. Companies are promising faster action, with the average time horizon now just eight years away, compared to 25 years in the past. The number of Fortune 500 companies with concrete, ambitious carbon targets has quadrupled in the past four years, to 23%.\n\nThe increase in activity comes after decades of pressure from environmental advocates and despite a lack of action from the U.S. government. The effects of climate change are becoming clearer to companies as wildfires, rising sea levels, droughts, and other symptoms of the crisis make headlines and affect business operations.\n\nSolar and wind energy have also become significantly cheaper, making it easier for some companies to commit to shifting away from fossil fuels. Pressure from investors, customers, and the general public is mounting, with investors increasingly asking companies about their climate policies, and public awareness and concern growing more intense.\n\nEmployees and children are also playing a role in pushing companies to take action. Workers at companies such as Amazon are pushing their bosses to change, and some other companies see this as a way to attract and retain talent. Kyum Kim, the co-founder of the app Blind, where tech workers discuss their workplaces, says that half his users say a company's climate policy affects whether they want to work there.\n\nMicrosoft's chief sustainability officer, Lucas Joppa, says it helps to frame climate action as an accounting problem, based on quantifying exactly how much companies emit and how much they'll need to cut. \"That really is what I see flip executives' mindsets around, is to just talk about this in terms that they understand... a climate 'budget,'\" Joppa says. \"At the end of the day, what companies are really good at doing is making decisions based on numbers.\"\n\nHowever, setting a carbon budget is one thing, sticking to it is another. Some climate announcements in the past, such as BP's previous rebranding as \"Beyond Petroleum,\" have been more PR push than actual shift in strategy, and advocates agree that follow-through and accountability will be essential if these new ambitious targets are to have an impact.\n\nSome experts also caution that relying on big corporations to drive the fight against climate change can be dangerous, as vulnerable and marginalized communities need to have input in how the world fights climate change and feel the benefits of a switch to green energy. Shalanda Baker, a professor at Northeastern University who studies the social justice dimensions of a transition away from fossil fuels, says that corporate action can be powerful but that government policy can make sure vulnerable populations are protected.\n\nIn conclusion, major corporations are making lofty climate promises and setting more ambitious emissions reduction targets. The increase in activity comes after decades of pressure from environmental advocates and despite a lack of action from the U.S. government. Solar and wind energy have become significantly cheaper, making it easier for some companies to commit to shifting away from fossil fuels.

    " Title: Supreme Court Tightens Election Rules in Multiple States, Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court appears to be fine-tuning the rules for the 2014 election, with recent decisions affecting early voting, same-day voter registration, and voter ID laws in several states. The high court's actions have sparked debate among legal analysts and judges, with some suggesting that the Court is more concerned with preventing last-minute voter confusion rather than upholding broad voting rights principles.\n\nOver the past three weeks, the Supreme Court has allowed Ohio to cut early voting by a week, let North Carolina end same-day voter registration, and blocked Wisconsin from implementing a new voter ID law. The Court could soon face another request to block a Texas voter ID law from being enforced in the upcoming elections.\n\nIn a statement, 5th U.S. Circuit Judge Edith Clement wrote, \"The stayed decisions have both upheld and struck down state statutes and affirmed and reversed district court decisions, so the timing of the decisions rather than their merits seems to be the key.\"\n\nThe high court justices who join in the court's actions on such emergency stays typically do not explain the reasoning behind the moves. Ohio State University professor Dan Tokaji suggests that the justices are concerned about last-minute voter confusion.\n\nThe tightening of election laws in all the states in question was pursued by Republican-led legislatures and objected to by Democratic and civil rights groups, who argued that it would disenfranchise minorities.\n\nIn the Ohio case, the Supreme Court produced a clearly partisan split, with the five GOP appointees voting to allow the state to cut back early voting by a week and the four Democratic appointees preferring to leave in place an appeals court order barring the change.\n\nThe North Carolina case, focusing on same-day registration and out-of-precinct voting, resulted in seven justices overturning an appeals court's ban on eliminating those accommodations. Two Democratic appointees, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, dissented, noting that the appeals court found that ending those two voting practices \"risked significantly reducing opportunities for black voters to exercise the franchise.\"\n\nOn the Wisconsin voter ID case, the high court split 6-3, with the liberal justices restoring the district court's ban on enforcement of the new voter ID requirements in the coming election. The three justices who dissented expressed concern about the absence of notifications on some absentee ballots regarding the need for photo ID.",
    " Title: Republican Party Faces Internal Strife Amidst Dominant Political Control\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party, currently holding the White House, Senate, House, 34 governorships, and controlling 26 state legislatures, is experiencing internal strife despite its dominant position across the United States. This is not the party's \"golden age,\" as the New York Times reports, due to attacks from various factions within the party, voter discontent, and disillusioned donors.\n\nSince 1980, the Republican Party has adopted a policy of \"radicalism for the win,\" which has led to the party being overtaken by Reagan's supply-side economics, Newt Gingrich's constant attacks on the system, the Tea Party's war on compromise, and now Donald Trump's cult of hate. This has resulted in a party that seeks out the worst in its candidates and demands disunity.\n\nRecent events have further highlighted the party's internal struggles. Last week, Senate Republicans lost one of their own when Roy S. Moore, the former state judge, defeated Senator Luther Strange in an Alabama Senate runoff. The retirement of Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee has sparked a potentially contentious fight for his seat, with Governor Bill Haslam, the establishment's preferred successor, declining to run. Additionally, a House Republican, Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, was forced to resign this week following the public disclosure of a text from his mistress in which she mocked him for his staunch opposition to abortion while pressuring her to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nWhile stories about \"Democrats in disarray\" have been common, the Republican Party is currently in disarray due to the proliferation of bomb-throwers within the party, with most members willing to attack other Republicans. This internal strife comes as Democrats are reportedly seeking unity in policy and are reluctant to line up under any leadership.",
    " Title: Republican Viewership of Late-Night Talk Shows: Colbert Lags Behind Kimmel, Fallon\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to a new survey by The Hollywood Reporter, Stephen Colbert's CBS show, \"The Late Show,\" has a viewership that more closely reflects his former Comedy Central audience, with Democrats, atheists, and men being more likely to tune in. In contrast, Republican viewers have largely abandoned Colbert, with only 17% of his viewers identifying as Republican, the smallest margin among the three major broadcast late-night shows.\n\nABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" has a higher percentage of Republican viewers at 33%, creating a 16-point gap between Colbert and Kimmel. The ideological split between Colbert's viewership is more pronounced, with 47% of his viewers identifying as Democrats, the highest margin among the three. Kimmel's viewership, on the other hand, shows a virtually nonexistent ideological split, with 34% Democrats and 33% Republicans. NBC's \"The Tonight Show\" host, Jimmy Fallon, has a slightly larger percentage of Republican viewers at 36%, compared to 31% Democrats.\n\nPollster Jon Penn explained that Colbert's audience is predominantly made up of wealthy, socially liberal men who support legalizing marijuana and want Bernie Sanders to be president. He described Kimmel's viewers as \"conservative-leaning,\" Colbert's viewers as \"liberal-leaning,\" and Fallon's fan base as \"swing.\" Interestingly, Fallon attracts the most female viewers, while 30% of Colbert's viewers describe themselves as atheist, the top \"religion category\" choice for \"The Late Show\" viewers.\n\nIn the overall poll, Fallon beats out both Colbert and Kimmel by a 2-to-1 margin when viewers were asked which of the hosts is an \"unpredictable, cool dude you want to be friends with.\" However, Colbert's liberal appeal may be limiting his wider audience growth. According to Mediaite, over the first six weeks since launching, Colbert beat Kimmel by an impressive 40% in the demo, but by the first week of November, there was a dramatic 45% swing in Kimmel's favor.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Rules NSA Bulk Collection of Phone Records Likely Unconstitutional\n\nArticle:\n\nA U.S. District Court Judge, Richard Leon, has ruled that the National Security Agency's (NSA) bulk collection of phone records likely violates the Constitution, marking a significant setback for the controversial spy agency. The ruling was granted in a preliminary injunction sought by plaintiffs Larry Klayman and Charles Strange, but the decision has been stayed pending appeal.\n\nIn his 68-page opinion, Judge Leon concluded that the two men are likely to be able to show that their privacy interests outweigh the government's interest in collecting the data. He ruled that the massive collection program is an unreasonable search under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which typically requires a neutral and detached authority between the police and the public.\n\nJudge Leon wrote, \"I can not imagine a more 'indiscriminate' and 'arbitrary invasion' than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval.\" He added that such a program infringes on \"that degree of privacy\" enshrined in the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe Obama administration has defended the program as a crucial tool against terrorism, but Judge Leon concluded that the government did not cite a single instance in which the program \"actually stopped an imminent terrorist attack.\" He expressed doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program in conducting time-sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism.\n\nAn order was entered to bar the government from collecting \"any telephony metadata associated with their personal Verizon accounts\" and requiring the government to \"destroy any such metadata in its possession\" collected through the program. The judge stayed his ruling pending appeal \"in light of the significant national security interests at stake in this case and the novelty of the constitutional issues.\"\n\nThe Justice Department released a brief statement after the decision, stating, \"We believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found. We have no further comment at this time.\" Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who exposed secrets about the NSA's data collection over the summer, released a statement praising the decision.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Bills Introduced to Strengthen U.S. Cybersecurity and Election Security\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States is facing ongoing cyberattacks from foreign adversaries, including China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, targeting its electoral processes. These attacks have involved hacking election systems, disseminating propaganda online, funneling money into elections through opaque groups, and hiring unregistered lobbyists.\n\nIn the 2016 election cycle, Russian-affiliated hackers attempted to access election systems in all 50 states. Since 2018, Twitter has removed at least 14,000 accounts tied to foreign influence operations by Venezuela, Russia, Iran, and others.\n\nThe attacks are a threat to the nation's security posture, and the government has yet to address them effectively due to political division in Washington. Even the largest social media platforms, such as Facebook, have admitted that they do not have all the tools to stop foreign actors.\n\nCongress has passed piecemeal legislation to address these cyberattacks, but there are still significant gaps that need to be filled. To strengthen the country's cybersecurity armor, bipartisan bills have been introduced.\n\nFor instance, Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have championed the Secure Elections Act, which aims to strengthen voting systems while clarifying each individual state's role in administering federal elections.\n\nAnother bill, the Defending Elections from Threats by Establishing Redlines (DETER) Act, has been proposed by Klobuchar and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). The DETER Act would impose sanctions on foreign countries that interfere in U.S. elections.\n\nThe Honest Ads Act, re-introduced by Klobuchar and Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), would subject online political ads to rules modeled on those in place for television and radio, in an attempt to safeguard U.S. politics from foreign disinformation campaigns.\n\nWhile these bills represent a first step toward ensuring that foreign adversaries will no longer attempt to influence the elections that represent the very heart of our democracy, cybersecurity failures are also crippling the underlying infrastructure of the economy.\n\nIn 2021, aggressive strains of ransomware infiltrated Atlanta and Baltimore's digital infrastructure, causing complete stops in their online operations. Members of Congress have recognized this pervasive issue but have expressed concerns about the federal government's role in addressing it.\n\nThe need for a bold, comprehensive plan that both parties can get behind to protect the nation's citizens, companies, governments, and democracy is urgent. Millions of Americans saw disinformation during the 2016 election produced by Russian agents, and China hacked into the Federal Election Commission, crashing the databases that track how money is both raised and spent during elections.\n\nThe U.S. faces a national security emergency, and its greatest institutions are under siege. Overcoming partisan politics and working together to protect the nation and the integrity of its elections is crucial. This is a chance for the nation's leaders to take up the mantle and defend, honor, and protect America for all of us today and for future generations.",
    " Title: Former President Jimmy Carter Calls for Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp's Resignation\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter has urged Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp to resign from his position overseeing the state's elections in a personal plea. Carter's appeal was made in a letter dated last Monday and was first obtained by The Associated Press. The contents of the letter were confirmed to NPR by a spokesperson for the Carter Center, the former president's organization devoted partly to monitoring democratic elections across the world.\n\nIn his letter to Kemp, Carter cited his decades of experience assisting elections abroad as the reason for his intervention in the bitter dispute now roiling the Georgia gubernatorial race. Kemp has been under fire for deciding to purge tens of thousands of voters from the voter rolls, months after declaring his intent to run for governor.\n\nCarter wrote, \"In Georgia's upcoming gubernatorial election, popular confidence is threatened not only by the undeniable racial discrimination of the past and the serious questions that the federal courts have raised about the security of Georgia's voting machines, but also because you are now overseeing the election in which you are a candidate.\"\n\nCarter further stated, \"This runs counter to the most fundamental principle of democratic elections\u2014that the electoral process be managed by an independent and impartial election authority.\"\n\nCarter is not the only prominent figure to raise concerns about Kemp's role as both candidate and referee in next week's election, and last year's voter purge is not the only move that has gotten Kemp embroiled in controversy. An APM Reports investigation found that removals have spiked during Kemp's tenure overseeing Georgia's election process. More than 1.6 million names were removed from the state's rolls in the past decade, including his eight years in office.\n\nAdditionally, a half-dozen civil rights groups recently sued the secretary of state over the delay of some 53,000 voter registration applications, which his office has placed on hold citing questions about the applicants' citizenship status. According to the AP, nearly 70 percent of those pending registrations came from African-Americans.\n\nKemp's Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, is seeking to become the first black female governor in U.S. history. The civil rights groups suing Kemp allege that the protocol will have a discriminatory impact on African-American, Latino, and Asian-American applicants and will impose severe burdens on voting-eligible Georgians' fundamental right to vote that are not justified by any rational or compelling state interest.\n\nKemp has denied wrongdoing and has dismissed previous calls for him to step down as secretary of state. He says his office's actions are squarely in line with a state protocol known as \"exact match,\" which requires that information supplied on voter registration forms line up precisely with the applicant's Social Security and driving records. Errors such as misspellings or the use of nicknames can result in delayed processing under the law passed last year.\n\nIn response to Carter's letter, a Kemp spokesman blamed Abrams for \"trying to distract voters with another publicity stunt.\" Campaign Communications Director Ryan Mahoney said in a statement, \"It's sad that she's using the former president to do her dirty work.\"\n\nA federal district judge held an emergency hearing on the matter Monday. The civil rights groups suing want the judge to order more election workers eligible to check those documents so things run smoother, according to Johnny Kauffman of Atlanta member station WABE.\n\nCarter did not get too deep into specifics in his personal appeal to Kemp. Rather, the former president laid out his argument as a broad plea to ensure the stability of Georgia's electoral process. \"In order to foster voter confidence in the upcoming election, which will be especially important if the race ends up very close, I urge you to step aside and hand over to a neutral authority the responsibility of overseeing the governor's election,\" Carter said. \"This would not address every concern, but it would be a sign that you recognize the importance of this key democratic principle and want to ensure the confidence of our citizens in the outcome.\"",
    " Title: Acting Homeland Security Secretary Anticipates 25% Drop in Border Apprehensions in June\n\nArticle:\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan announced on Friday that the government expects a significant drop in illegal immigrant border apprehensions by up to 25% in June compared to May. McAleenan attributed the decrease to a deal President Donald Trump struck with Mexico and a new policy that requires asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their court hearings in the U.S.\n\n\"It's become clear that over the past three weeks, since the administration reached a new agreement with Mexico, we've seen a substantial increase in the number of interdictions on the Mexican southern border and a sincere effort to address the transportation networks coming through Mexico,\" McAleenan said at a news conference.\n\nMcAleenan explained that the 25% decrease in June is more significant than what has been observed in past years. In May, immigration authorities apprehended 144,000 illegal immigrants, the highest single-month number since 2006.\n\nHowever, NBC News reported that the projected decrease in border apprehensions could be attributed to summer conditions, as it is typical for border crossings to decrease during the summer months. McAleenan rejected this claim, stating that this year's May to June decrease is more significant than previous years.\n\nMcAleenan cautioned that officials will not know until the end of July whether their efforts \"are sustained and having a significant impact.\"\n\nDuring the press conference, McAleenan also addressed allegations that migrant children are not being properly cared for at detainment centers. \"Contrary to the reporting, children in CBP custody at the border are receiving access to key supplies, including toothbrushes, appropriate meals, blankets, showers as soon as they can be provided, and medical screening,\" he claimed.",
    " Title: Election 2016: Anxiety, Anger, and the American Voter\n\nArticle:\n\nThis week, National Public Radio (NPR) and several of its member stations will be gauging the sentiments of voters across the country. Follow their coverage on Twitter at the provided links.\n\nThe mood of the electorate in the 2016 election year is characterized by anxiety, fear, and anger. Candidates from both major parties are attempting to demonstrate their understanding of these emotions.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders' fiery critiques of Wall Street have resonated with voters (for more on this, see NPR's report by Brian Naylor). Hillary Clinton frequently discusses the fears and insecurities of average voters.\n\nOn the Republican side, no candidate has tapped into or fueled voter anger as effectively as Donald Trump. In the latest Republican debate, Trump declared, \"I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.\"\n\nThere are several reasons for this widespread voter discontent. Here are some key factors:\n\n1. Economic Growth: The absence of broad-based economic growth that enables the American dream is a significant concern. Bill Galston, a former Clinton White House aide, explained, \"People have gone a long time without making a lot of progress. They know it, they're feeling it, and they're not very happy about it.\"\n\n2. Terrorism: The December attack in San Bernardino, California, brought the war on terrorism to American soil, causing widespread fear.\n\n3. Demographic Change: In 2014, the majority of American kindergarteners were minorities, according to Harvard political scientist Danielle Allen. This demographic shift is causing tension, particularly in discussions about immigration.\n\n4. Immigration: Immigration has become a contentious issue, particularly in the Republican primaries. According to immigration expert Roberto Suro of the University of Southern California, it is not specific immigrants or immigration itself that voters are angry about, but rather it serves as a conduit for anxieties about jobs, terrorism, and government inefficiency.\n\n5. Gridlocked Politics: The inability of the political system to address major issues is exacerbating voter anxiety.\n\n6. Elite Dissatisfaction: Voters in both parties are angry at elites, but their targets differ. For Republicans, the focus is on government and professional experts, while for Democrats, and more left-leaning Democrats, the focus is on economic and financial elites.\n\nThe extent to which these angry anti-elitist sentiments will influence the primary elections remains to be seen. Elections serve as a mirror to society, reflecting the feelings and desires of the electorate. The 2016 elections are being defined by these feelings of anger and anxiety.",

The meeting was arranged to push for the waiving of diplomatic immunity for the American woman, Anne Sacoolas, to seek justice for their son.\n\nHarry Dunn was 19 when he was killed in an August accident. He was riding his motorcycle on the correct side of the road when the 42-year-old diplomat's wife, who has been widely named as Anne Sacoolas, drove out of the RAF Croughton US Air Force base onto the wrong side of the road and hit the teen head-on, according to Sky News.\n\nSacoolas claimed diplomatic immunity and fled the UK earlier this October, despite initially telling police she would cooperate with the investigation, police said. Many are now calling for Sacoolas to return to the UK so the investigation can continue.\n\nIn an interview with BBC, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed hope that Anne Sacoolas would return and engage with the UK's legal processes. Sacoolas has not yet spoken publicly about the incident and could not be immediately reached by the media.\n\nDunn's parents have been pleading for justice for their son, directly asking for Trump to send Sacoolas back to the UK. In an interview with Sky News, Charlotte Charles, Dunn's mother, said, \"President Trump, please listen. We\u2019re a family in ruin. We\u2019re broken. We can\u2019t grieve. Please, please, let her get back on a plane. Come back to the UK.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the parents visited the White House to make that plea to Trump in person. They said they did not know Sacoolas was in the next room, waiting for Trump to introduce them. The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said the meeting between Trump and the Dunns was held \"at the request of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\"\n\nGrisham added, \"The President met with members of the Dunn family to personally offer his condolences for the loss of their son.\" According to Grisham, Trump's intent was to comfort the victims of the tragic accident.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the White House, Charles said, \"The bombshell was dropped\" by Trump that \"Anne Sacoolas was in the building and was willing to meet with us.\" The Dunn family said they refused the meeting but said they \"would still love to meet with her but it has to be on our terms and on UK soil.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump confirmed to reporters that he had arranged the meeting, saying he had \"offered to bring the person in question in, and they were not ready for it.\" Trump added that accidents like the one that killed Harry Dunn are common for visiting Americans because \"the roads are opposite.\"\n\n\"That happens in Europe, you go to Europe and the roads are opposite. It's very tough if you're from the United States,\" Trump said. \"That happens to a lot of people, by the way.\"",
    " Title: California Files Lawsuit Against Trump Administration Over New Visa Rule Affecting International Students\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced on Thursday that the state had filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a new visa rule that requires international students to leave the United States if all their classes are online. The lawsuit, which is supported by the California State University system (CSU) and California Community Colleges officials, claims the rule unfairly harms international students and puts them, teachers, other students, and the community at large at risk of getting and spreading the coronavirus or being subject to deportation.\n\nIn a statement, Becerra said, \"Shame on the Trump Administration for risking not only the education opportunities for students who earned the chance to go to college, but now their health and well-being as well.\" He added, \"Not on our watch...Today's lawsuit rests on America's enduring principle that everyone who works hard and plays by the rules can earn a chance to get ahead. We'll see the Trump Administration in court.\"\n\nCal State schools plan to mainly hold online classes in the fall due to the virus, according to The Los Angeles Times. CSU Chancellor Timothy White called the policy \"callous and inflexible,\" adding it places thousands of international students into an \"extremely difficult position.\"\n\nIn a letter to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, called for the extension of an exemption adopted by ICE in March through the end of the 2020-2021 school year. The ICE exemption allowed international students with F-1 visas to attend classes online while retaining their visa status.\n\nUnder the new policy, F-1 and M-1 visa holders \"must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status,\" Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement, according to NBC News. The rules would also hurt colleges already struggling financially amid the outbreak since many colleges rely on international student tuition. California has more students on international visas than any other state, NBC reported.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks an injunction to block the policy and separately, the University of California plans to seek a restraining order as well. Becerra said it is the 86th lawsuit he's filed against the administration.",
    " Title: Georgia Governor Primary Runoff: Kemp and Cagle Battle for Trump's Conservative Endorsement\n\nArticle:\n\nGeorgia voters will choose between two Trump-backing candidates, Brian Kemp and Casey Cagle, in the Republican primary runoff for governor on Tuesday. The race has been marked by a series of secretly recorded tapes, eye-catching advertisements, and an unexpected endorsement from President Trump.\n\nBrian Kemp, who has described himself as a \"politically incorrect conservative,\" made headlines in May for running an advertisement that boasted about having a pick-up truck \"in case I need to round up criminal illegals.\" Trump endorsed Kemp last week, surprising the candidate who was in a press conference at the time.\n\nKemp stated to a media outlet on Monday that Georgia is a solid-red state that needs an \"unapologetic conservative.\" He described Trump's endorsement as \"huge\" and compared it to \"pouring gasoline on a fire.\"\n\nLt. Gov. Casey Cagle's candidacy has been affected by the release of several furtively-recorded audio tapes, including one in which Cagle allegedly offered to help pay off former gubernatorial candidate Clay Tippins' $300,000 in campaign debt in exchange for an endorsement. Cagle denied the allegations, stating he never offered a bribe for any reason and expressed frustration with \"antics\" in the race.\n\nIn another secretly recorded tape, Cagle seemed to disparage some of his constituents, saying the race was about \"who had the biggest gun, who had the biggest truck, and who would be the craziest.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence made his presence felt in the race, headlining a rally for Kemp, whom he called \"tough on crime\" and \"strong on borders.\" Pence's appearance in Georgia followed a stop earlier in the day in Tennessee, where Pence touted Republican tax cuts and campaigned with two GOP congresswomen waging tough campaigns for statewide offices.\n\nThe winner of Tuesday's Republican contest will face Democrat Stacey Abrams in the general election in November. Abrams is seeking to become the first black female governor in the U.S.",
    " Title: Democrats Focus on Presidential Abuse of Power and Obstruction of Congress in Impeachment Articles\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocrats in the United States House of Representatives have reportedly decided to focus on a straightforward case of presidential abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. The decision to keep the impeachment charges simple is an attempt to make the case easy to understand.\n\nThe alleged abuse of power involves President Trump using the foreign policy tools at his disposal for personal political gain, specifically in the Ukraine controversy. The obstruction of Congress charges stem from the president's denial of relevant documents and witness testimony during the investigation.\n\nThe Democrats argue that the security of the 2020 presidential election and the protection of congressional authority as a co-equal branch of government are at stake. The main script for the impeachment process appears to involve a quick vote in the Judiciary Committee, followed by a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, leading to presidential impeachment and a Senate trial.\n\nIn the meantime, Congressional Democrats are expected to approve President Trump's renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a move that has caused consternation among some liberals. The impeachment process is currently surrounded by a fever of allegations and accusations, including claims of intelligence agency misconduct in the investigation of 2016 Trump-Russia ties, presidential Twitter barbs at the FBI director, and criminal investigations of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWhile the main script for the impeachment process may be clear, the underlying unpredictability is the only predictable result.",
    " Title: Trump Doubles Down on Threat to Strike Iranian Cultural Sites\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has reiterated his threat to target Iranian cultural heritage sites, asserting that the U.S. has the right to do so. In comments to White House pool reporters, Trump dismissed criticism from human rights organizations, stating that such an action would not be considered a war crime under international law.\n\nTrump's remarks follow tweets on Saturday threatening to attack sites \"at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture\" should Iranian-backed forces strike U.S. civilians or military targets in the Middle East in retaliation for the death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force, in a U.S. airstrike.\n\nIran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded in his own tweet, warning that such strikes would violate international law. \"Having committed grave breaches of int'l law in Friday's cowardly assassinations, @realDonaldTrump threatens to commit again new breaches of JUS COGENS,\" Zarif tweeted. \"Targeting cultural sites is a WAR CRIME.\"\n\nThe president's remarks were also criticized by officials at Human Rights Watch, a leading international rights group, which warned that Trump was threatening \"war crimes\" by insinuating that cultural sites could be targeted. \"President Trump should publicly reverse his threats against Iran\u2019s cultural property and make clear that he will not authorize nor order war crimes,\" Andrea Prasow, acting Washington director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cThe US Defense Department should publicly reaffirm its commitment to abide by the laws of war and comply only with lawful military orders.\"",
    " Title: Former Aides of Senator Max Baucus Assist in Fundraising for Re-election Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Max Baucus' political career in Montana is reportedly being supported by a number of his former aides, who assist in fundraising activities. These activities include weekend fundraising retreats in Big Sky, Montana, and intimate events in Washington, D.C., such as a gathering last month near the Capitol.\n\nAmong the top givers is Jeffrey A. Forbes, a former Finance Committee staff director for Senator Baucus, who has donated at least $25,000 to Senator Baucus, his political action committee, or the Montana Democratic Party. Forbes, who is a partner at a lobbying firm, has donated significantly more when contributions from his clients, including Verizon and Altria, are included.\n\nPaul Wilkins, Senator Baucus' chief of staff, has reportedly emphasized the importance of these donations and fundraising efforts. He stated that the nearly $4.6 million expected in hand by the end of this month would rank Senator Baucus' campaign chest among the top 10 in the Senate.\n\nAt a private event, Wilkins thanked former Baucus aides turned lobbyists for their support, noting that the fundraising efforts are \"the basis of everything that we do.\" A New York Times reporter was asked to leave this event.\n\nWhen asked about his comments later, Wilkins stated, \"There is no expectation that former staffers do anything related to the office. They are private individuals, if they want to donate, fine. If they don't want to donate, that is fine, too.\"\n\nSenator Baucus' office notes that the former aides who now work as tax lobbyists are a small fraction of those who have worked for him over the years. However, several colleagues who have served more than two decades on the finance panel, including Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, have much smaller networks of former aides who are tax lobbyists, according to data collected by LegiStorm and the Center for Responsive Politics.",
    " Title: Obama Accuses Congress of Political Obstruction in Delay of Attorney General Nominee Loretta Lynch\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama has accused Congress of playing politics with law enforcement and national security by delaying the confirmation of Loretta Lynch as Attorney General. In his weekly address to the nation on Sunday, Mr. Obama criticized Republicans for preventing the female federal prosecutor from New York from succeeding Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe nomination of Ms. Lynch has been delayed by more than 130 days due to concerns surrounding President Obama's executive action on immigration, which would provide temporary legal status to millions of illegal immigrants and reprieve from deportation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, is reportedly using the nomination as leverage to pass the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, a bill containing language that would prohibit the use of restitution funds for abortions.\n\nPresident Obama tapped Ms. Lynch to replace Mr. Holder in November, and he has become more vocal about the roadblocks that Republicans have set up for his nominee in recent weeks. Republicans control both the House and the Senate.\n\n\"No one can claim she's unqualified,\" Mr. Obama said during his weekly address. \"No one's saying she can't do the job. Senators from both parties say they support her. This is purely about politics.\"\n\nThe White House has previously criticized the delay of Ms. Lynch's confirmation vote, with White House press secretary Josh Earnest describing it as \"an unconscionable delay\" during a March 16 press briefing.\n\n\"There is not a single legitimate question that has been raised about her aptitude for this job,\" Mr. Earnest said. \"Instead, all we've seen is a bunch of political obstruction from Republicans that, again, does not speak well of Republicans' efforts to run the Senate in an effective fashion and certainly not in a way that's in the best interest of the country.\"\n\nPresident Obama reiterated this point during an interview with Huffington Post, stating that it was wrong for Congress to hold the attorney general nominee hostage \"for other issues.\"\n\n\"Republicans promised that Congress would function smoothly with them in charge,\" Mr. Obama said during his weekend address. \"Here's a small chance for them to prove it.\"",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Intensifies Trump Investigation, Adopts Resolution for Impeachment Proceedings\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee has voted to intensify its investigation of President Donald Trump, adopting a resolution that allows it to designate hearings as impeachment proceedings. The 41-member panel's decision brings the committee closer to deciding whether to recommend Trump's impeachment.\n\nThe resolution permits the committee to subject witnesses to more aggressive questioning and quicken the pace of the investigation, which is expanding into areas that could prove politically explosive for both Trump and Congress. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler announced the new procedures after a 24-17 vote along party lines.\n\n\"With these new procedures, we will begin next week an aggressive series of hearings investigating allegations of corruption, obstruction, and abuse of power against the president,\" Nadler told reporters.\n\nThe more aggressive probe could increase pressure on House Democratic leaders, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted impeachment of Trump as a politically risky step for moderate Democratic freshmen from swing districts where ousting the president is an unpopular idea.\n\nTrump responded to the vote with a statement on his Facebook page, stating, \"If they go down the path of impeachment they will be dividing the nation! So ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side.\"\n\nTrump and his Republican allies argue that former U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign's possible collusion stemmed from an earlier effort to sink his candidacy and later his presidency by former officials at the Justice Department.\n\nRepublican lawmakers rejected the notion that the panel was pursuing an impeachment inquiry and dismissed the resolution as a \"fantasy\" intended to distract from Democrats' unwillingness to have the full House authorize a formal impeachment inquiry, as occurred during the Watergate era and the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.\n\nRepublicans said Democrats lacked the votes to obtain formal House authorization and denounced Thursday's action as a show intended to pander to Democratic voters who want Trump removed from office.\n\nCommittee Democrats plan to use the new tactics that allow an hour of questioning by committee lawyers of Corey Lewandowski, a close Trump confidant and one of his campaign managers in 2016. Lewandowski is due to appear before the panel next Tuesday for what may be a contentious hearing.\n\nDemocrats expect his testimony to help lay out a charge of obstruction of justice. However, they are also pursuing allegations of campaign finance violations, witness tampering, and unlawful self-enrichment through his business ventures.\n\nDemocrats aim to decide by the end of the year whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Trump to the full House. If approved by the chamber, the Republican-controlled Senate would be left to hold a trial and consider the president's ouster.\n\nA head count shows that 135 House Democrats back an impeachment inquiry. While that is a majority of the caucus, the number is well short of the 218 votes needed to pass a resolution. Only two American presidents have been impeached by the House: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Clinton in 1999. Neither was convicted by the Senate. Nixon resigned in 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against him, but before the full House voted on the matter.",
    " Title: Federal Court Hears Challenge to Affordable Care Act Subsidy Rule\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a federal court on Tuesday, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as ObamaCare, faced another legal challenge as a group of business owners and individuals contested an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulation. The plaintiffs argue that the regulation, which determines eligibility for subsidies in connection with health care coverage, is unlawful and potentially crippling.\n\nThe contested regulation, stemming from the ACA, defines which applicants are eligible for subsidies based on the state in which they apply. The plaintiffs in Halbig v. Sebelius claim that the plain text of the ACA limits subsidies to applicants in states that have set up their own exchanges.\n\nSam Kazman, general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, stated, \"Congress figured because it was loading up the state exchanges with a lot of goodies that just about every state would make the choice to participate.\" However, he noted that dozens of states declined the offer, leading to the IRS and the administration's interpretation that extends attractive subsidies to all states, including those that opted out. This interpretation, according to Kazman, gives rise to both employer and individual mandates and penalties, which are critical to funding the ACA.\n\nThe government, which lost its bid to have the case dismissed, argues that the plaintiffs are misreading the statute. In its motion to dismiss filing, the Department of Justice stated, \"The plaintiffs' reading of the act is wrong.\" The government argues that an exchange established by the federal government stands in the shoes of the exchange that a state chooses not to establish.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paul Friedman posed tough questions for both sides during the hearing, including the extent and location of information needed to understand Congress's intent. The plaintiffs argue that the text of the law is sufficient, while the government argues that reading the provision literally and out of context would be nonsensical.\n\nJudge Friedman pledged to deliver a quick ruling, but offered no timeline. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for the implementation and funding of the Affordable Care Act.",
    " Title: The Federal Reserve: A Closer Look at Its Role and Impact on the Economy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Reserve, often considered a complex and obscure institution, has been a subject of debate among economists, politicians, and the general public. The Fed, created in 1913, has a significant impact on the economy, and its actions can affect individual savings and future prospects.\n\nAlan Greenspan, a former Fed chairman, admitted to intentionally using ambiguous language, known as \"Fedspeak,\" to avoid unsettling financial markets. Greenspan, who was once a disciple of libertarian Ayn Rand, was known for his clarity in his youth, but his language during his tenure as Fed chairman was far less transparent. His successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, are also often criticized for their lack of clarity.\n\nThe Fed's balance sheet has grown to an unprecedented $4 trillion, a fact that has raised concerns among some, including Sen. Rand Paul's father, retired Texas Congressman Ron Paul. Paul has argued that the Fed should not have the authority to create money out of thin air. For three decades, Ron Paul was virtually alone in questioning the Fed's role, but in recent times, more voices have emerged to challenge the institution.\n\nJim Bruce's documentary \"Money for Nothing\" provides a beginner's guide to the Fed, highlighting how the last two chairmen, appointed by both Republicans and Democrats, have increased central planning of the economy. The documentary argues that the Fed's actions have led to government control of more of the economy than ever before, a situation that is not considered a positive development.\n\nThe Fed was initially created to prevent bank runs and provide stability. However, the Fed's low interest rates during the Roaring Twenties led to the Great Stock Market Crash, and its tight money policies worsened the Depression. Despite claims of learning from their mistakes, the Fed's actions have been criticized for creating economic bubbles rather than promoting stability.\n\nThe Fed is now tasked with two missions: preserving a stable currency and reducing unemployment. This dual mandate has led to increased pressure on the Fed to make timely decisions to avoid economic downturns and, some argue, to make current political officeholders look good. This focus on the Fed's decisions has led investors and Wall Street analysts to pay more attention to the Fed's actions rather than inventions, productivity, and real wealth-creation.\n\nCritics argue that the Fed, created to support capitalism, has become an instrument of government economic management, similar to a socialist planning board. The Fed's main mission has evolved into continually stimulating economic activity through cash infusions to maintain the illusion of economic stability.\n\nThe Fed's actions during the post-recession recovery have been criticized as ineffective, with some comparing it to Japan's central bank, which has attempted the same stimulus strategies for the past 15 years without success. In contrast, Canada, which had no central bank during the Great Depression, fared better, with not a single bank failure during the 1930s.\n\nThe massive bank bailouts during the financial crisis are based on the assumption that the banks are \"too big to fail.\" However, critics argue that these banks, along with the Federal Reserve, are too big and powerful, posing a risk to the entire economy if they fail. The concentration of power in a small group of individuals is a concern for many.\n\nIn conclusion, the Federal Reserve, created to prevent bank runs and provide stability, has become a subject of debate due to its role in the economy and its impact on individual savings and the future. Critics argue that the Fed's actions have led to economic bubbles rather than promoting stability, and that its dual mandate has led to increased focus on the Fed's decisions rather than real wealth-creation. The debate surrounding the Fed's role and impact on the economy is ongoing.",
    " Title: House Democrats Plan to Invite Guests Affected by White House Policies for Trump's First Congressional Address\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Democrats are strategizing to make President Donald Trump's first speech to Congress as uncomfortable as possible by inviting guests they believe will be adversely affected by new White House policies. This tactic is a shift from some Democrats who skipped Trump's inauguration last month in protest.\n\nThe strategy involves inviting ethnic minorities, LGBT individuals, undocumented immigrants, the disabled, and others to the joint session on Feb. 28. The goal is to place Trump face-to-face with people who feel alienated or targeted by his controversial executive orders.\n\nIn a letter circulating on Capitol Hill, a group of liberal Democrats is urging their colleagues to bring guests who have made \"a positive impact\" on their communities despite discrimination or marginalization. The letter states, \"It is our hope that their presence in the House Gallery will remind President Trump that he is not the arbiter of patriotism. This country belongs to all of us, and his rhetoric of intolerance will not stand.\"\n\nThe authors of the letter include Reps. Jim Langevin (D-RI), who was shot accidentally as a teen and became the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress; Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM), head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; Cedric Richmond (D-LA), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus; Judy Chu (D-CA), head of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus; and David Cicilline (D-RI) and Jared Polis (D-CO), the co-chairman of the LGBT Equality Caucus.\n\nSome Democrats are also considering another form of protest during the speech: refusing to shake hands with Trump as he walks down the center aisle of the House chamber on his way to the dais. Representatives Luis Guti\u00e9rrez (D-IL) and Filemon Vela (D-TX) have expressed their intention to avoid this tradition.\n\nTrump's campaign rhetoric has been combative from the start, and he has continued this approach in the White House. Most recently, he temporarily banned all refugees from entering the U.S., as well as immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. This move sparked an outcry from Democrats and human rights groups, and drew thousands of protestors to airports and streets across the country.\n\nThe Democrats aim to maintain this spirit of protest as Trump prepares for his speech to Congress. The Democrats' letter states, \"Instead of celebrating the very diversity that makes our country a beacon of inclusion and equality, he has chosen to vilify, bully, and alienate women, immigrants, people of color, people with disabilities, and people of differing faiths.\" They further assert, \"His rhetoric emboldens those who seek a scapegoat for the challenges this country faces.\"",
    " Title: GOP Senators Urge Trump to Invoke U.N. Snapback Mechanism in Response to Iran's Nuclear Violations\n\nArticle:\n\nThree Republican senators have urged President Trump to invoke the \"snapback\" mechanism in a United Nations resolution that endorsed the 2015 nuclear agreement, in response to Iran's violation of the deal. The senators, Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), wrote a letter on Tuesday, urging Trump to reject what they describe as Iran's \"nuclear blackmail.\"\n\nIran has recently begun stockpiling low-enriched uranium beyond the agreed limits, in violation of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The senators argue that Iran is signaling an intent to creep towards a nuclear weapon while demanding concessions and promising to \"reverse\" their violations if their demands are met.\n\nThe senators' letter comes as Iran's threats to enrich uranium could soon test the process of bringing the snapback mechanism into effect. The mechanism, outlined in United Nations Security Council resolution 2231, would restore sanctions on Iran's uranium enrichment and missile development.\n\nThe senators argue that the U.S., as a participant in the resolution, should invoke the snapback mechanism to end civil-nuclear waivers that they claim allow Iran to maintain a nuclear status quo. The preferred mechanism for disputes in the JCPOA is a joint commission of eight members to decide if it goes to the Security Council. However, Tehran's threats to enrich uranium mean the process of bringing the snapback mechanism into effect will likely be tested sooner rather than later.\n\nFrom 2006 onwards, the United Nations Security Council passed six resolutions that imposed severe sanctions on Iran in an attempt to halt its nuclear ambitions by banning Iran from conducting nuclear research and developing ballistic missiles.\n\nIt is unclear how such a move would be received by America's European allies at the Security Council, who opposed the U.S. departure from the deal and have fought to keep the compact intact. Behnam Ben Taleblu, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington D.C., told Fox News that if the snapback mechanism is used and resolution 2231 is done away with, \"it would also mean the Rouhani government's policy of playing both sides of the Atlantic against one another would have failed.\"\n\nAn indication of the interagency discussions came earlier in the week from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whose statement on Iran's violation called on the international community to restore its longstanding requirement of not allowing any uranium enrichment for the regime's nuclear program in light of Iran's latest violation. His statement pulled no punches as he noted that \"no nuclear deal should ever allow the Iranian regime to enrich uranium at any level.\"\n\nA senior GOP congressional staffer told Fox News that \"snapback is quickly becoming the only game in town, now that Iran has violated the deal.\" The staffer added that, even though the U.S. left the deal, the administration still has every right per the resolution to put the snapback mechanism into play. \"There's no technical reason the Trump administration can't just do it and quickly restore the international sanctions from before the deal,\" the staffer stated, adding that some officials wanted to hold off while the Europeans negotiated with Iran to stay in bounds. \"Now that the Europeans have failed and the Iranians are engaged in nuclear blackmail, there's no reason left to hold off.\"",
    " Title: Grand Jury Impaneled in Mueller Investigation Fueling Speculation of Widening Scope\n\nArticle:\n\nThe impaneling of a grand jury by special counsel Robert Mueller has stirred speculation in Washington, D.C., suggesting that the investigation into Russian election meddling is expanding in both scope and gravity. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Mueller, who has amassed a team of 16 prosecutors in recent weeks, now has a dedicated pool of 23 grand jurors tasked with examining subpoenaed documents, listening to witness testimony, and determining whether criminal charges are warranted.\n\nHowever, a spokesman for the special counsel declined to confirm or deny the existence of the grand jury. Legal experts argue that the development is not unexpected, as a special investigator with broad authority from the Justice Department to probe allegations with proximity to the White House would typically convene a select grand jury.\n\nThe grand jury's location in Washington, D.C., is significant because Mueller reportedly already had a grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, for an investigation into the business dealings and campaign contacts of Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. If Mueller's investigation were limited to Flynn, some legal experts argue, he would not have needed to impanel a new grand jury in the nation's capital.\n\nThe existence of a grand jury indicates that Mueller will be pursuing criminal charges, although the target and the channels of investigation remain unknown. Mueller has subpoena powers and can compel witnesses to testify before his grand jury, which would also vote on whether to indict any subjects of his investigations.\n\nThe top-level legal talent that Mueller continues to attract, such as Greg Andres of the New York law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, who left his partnership to join the team, suggests that the special counsel is preparing for a prolonged investigation.\n\n\"This is going well into 2018, and whether it lasts beyond that is anyone's guess,\" said Robert Ray, the special counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton's Whitewater dealings. \"This is an indication that it will not be wrapped up in 30, 60, or 90 days.\"\n\nExperts caution against reading too much into the formation of a grand jury, which is an expected step for a seasoned prosecutor like Mueller. Additionally, grand juries do not always return indictments. For instance, Ray's Whitewater grand jury did not result in criminal charges against the president.\n\n\"If I'm in Trump World, I don't know that this rattles me because it's not a surprise, but it's certainly not good news for the president,\" said John Wood, a former U.S. attorney. \"It's newsworthy because there was always the possibility the investigation would wrap up soon, and this is an indication it won't.\"\n\nHowever, it does not necessarily mean that charges are imminent. Grand juries are used for both the investigation and charging phases, so there may be no charges. The grand jury and special counsel will operate largely in secrecy, and it will likely be some time before the targets of the investigation or the investigation's direction are known.\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired, testified that the president was never the target of an investigation when he was in charge of the bureau, in contrast to media reports that suggested otherwise. \"Comey said three times the president is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that has changed,\" said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has escalated his attacks against Mueller in recent weeks, labeling the investigation a \"witch hunt\" and drawing attention to alleged conflicts of interest with members of Mueller's team. Trump's allies have described Mueller and Comey as close friends and have drawn attention to Democratic donations from some of the lawyers on the special counsel.\n\nThere has long been speculation that the president would fire Mueller or seek to have him removed, but Trump attorney Jay Sekulow dismissed that speculation in an interview on Fox News' \"Your World with Neil Cavuto.\"\n\n\"The president is not thinking about firing Robert Mueller, so the speculation that's out there is just incorrect,\" he said. Sekulow also downplayed the impaneling of the grand jury, saying it was expected. \"This is not a surprise because the impaneling of a grand jury in situations like this, when you've got an investigation, is typically how you move forward,\" Sekulow said. \"It is really much a standard operating procedure when you've got a situation like this, but with respect to the impaneling of the grand jury, we have no reason to believe that the president is under investigation here.\"\n\nWhite House special counsel Ty Cobb said he only learned of the grand jury through media reports. \"Grand jury matters are typically secret,\" Cobb said in a statement. \"The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Campaign Rally in Pensacola: A Case of Projection and Counter-Projection\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a campaign rally in Pensacola, Florida, on Friday night, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump appeared to employ a strategy of projection and counter-projection in his speech. This tactic involves attributing one's own traits, actions, or criticisms to one's political opponent.\n\nDuring the rally, Trump criticized his opponent, Hillary Clinton, stating that she has only managed to stay out of trouble. This comment was a direct reference to the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into Clinton's private email server.\n\nIn response to chants of \"lock her up\" from the crowd, Trump seemed to deviate from his prepared speech. He said, \"Because she is being so protected, she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching right smack in the middle of the heart, and she wouldn't be prosecuted.\" This assertion mirrors a statement Trump made about himself nearly nine months ago, during a campaign event in Sioux Center, Iowa, where he said, \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters.\"\n\nLater in the speech, Trump echoed another criticism that has been aimed at him, turning it back onto Clinton. \"She's trigger-happy,\" Trump said of Clinton. \"Personally, I think she's an unstable person.\" Clinton has made similar arguments about Trump, stating that he is \"temperamentally unfit\" to be president and that his ideas are \"dangerously incoherent.\"\n\nThis pattern of projection and counter-projection has been observed in Trump's campaign speeches recently. Last week, Trump criticized Clinton for not providing specific policy details, despite her releasing a 288-page book detailing her proposed policies the same day, according to NPR's Tamara Keith. Not providing concrete policy plans is a criticism Clinton often brings up about her opponent.\n\nIn late August, Trump tweeted that Clinton was \"pandering to the worst instincts in our society.\" This tweet was in response to a speech Clinton gave that day, in which she made a similar criticism about Trump, saying he \"built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia\" and \"is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.\"\n\nFor the rest of the night in Florida, Trump mostly stayed on his standard messages, both those in line with traditional conservative values and his own lines, such as his promise to build the wall (with Mexico paying) and the idea of being friendly with Russia. However, he did veer off course one other time, suggesting that he would shoot Iranians circling U.S. destroyers. \"With Iran,\" Trump told the crowd, \"when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they should not be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water.\"\n\nBloomberg reporter Jennifer Jacobs tweeted that this remark, along with the earlier comment about Clinton shooting someone, were both instances when Trump went off teleprompter.",
    " Title: Lack of Consistent Leadership and Scientific-Based Decision Making Exacerbates COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 500,000 deaths globally in the past four months, with many experts believing the actual numbers to be much higher. This rapid spread and high death toll are unprecedented, with the last time such a large number of people perished in such a short time being during the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nThe virus, like radiation, is invisible, potentially deadly, and can cause permanent damage to those exposed. This is a mass casualty event that requires a unified, scientific-based response. However, the lack of consistent leadership and politically driven messaging has left many citizens confused and directionless.\n\nIn the United States, the lack of clear, factual information and the politicization of protective measures such as mask-wearing has led to a divide among the populace. The act of wearing a mask has become a symbol of unity and common decency for some, while for others, it represents restricted rights and oppression.\n\nThe recent surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations in Texas, following the Lt. Governor's disregard for state and federal medical authorities' guidance, is a prime example of the consequences of political negligence. The people of Texas deserve better leadership that prioritizes the health and safety of its citizens over political goals.\n\nThe message \"We have to learn to live with the pandemic\" is covert messaging that implies accepting the high number of deaths as inevitable. As a physician, this is unacceptable. Instead of casting doubt upon science and the collective knowledge concerning this threat, leaders should promote truth and transparency.\n\nThe current lack of leadership has led to mass casualties among our own citizens. Systemic neglect and sadistic behaviors, such as those manifested by national leaders, are easier to apply when most of the potential victims are poor, brown, and black. COVID-19, however, does not discriminate and will affect many regardless of political affiliation or socio-economic standing.\n\nThe best thing our politicians can do is to stop disseminating information based on political expediency and listen to science. They should apply true leadership by taking a step back and allowing the experts to speak directly to the public. The mission, the battle, the war is what is most important.\n\nHarry S. Truman once said, \"It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.\" Oh, for the leadership of a Truman, now! The past is there to remind us of things we may have forgotten. Let us not make it obvious to the world that we have learned nothing from history.\n\nEventually, this will affect every citizen. No bombs were ever dropped directly on the United States during World War II, yet as a nation, we all strove, sacrificed, and did our part to help save others. You may not know anyone who has contracted COVID or has died from it, but unless we work together in unity, you most undoubtedly will.",
    " Title: Republican Veepstakes: The Delicate Balance Between Safe and Boring\n\nArticle:\n\nThe race for the vice-presidential nomination, often referred to as the Veepstakes, is approaching its final stages, with several low-drama options, including Rob Portman, Tim Pawlenty, and Bobby Jindal, being considered.\n\nSenator Rob Portman from Ohio, known for his impressive chicken imitation and a 1900-mile kayak journey along the Rio Grande River, is believed to be a top contender for Mitt Romney's running mate. However, Portman has been facing criticism for being too dull for the ticket, with comedian Stephen Colbert referring to a potential Romney-Portman union as \"the bland leading the bland.\"\n\nThe politics of boring can be delicate, as a 2012 veep hopeful should be solid, smart, and noncontroversial, but not so unexciting that they are perceived as uninteresting or prone to controversy. This is a challenge for Portman, as well as other charisma-challenged politicians on Romney's presumed shortlist, such as former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.\n\nSupporters of Portman argue that his wonkish demeanor hides a real character. Former New York congressman Rick Lazio, who shared a house with Portman in Washington, stated, \"If you define exciting as a celebrity who invites controversy\u2014he\u2019s not that guy. But he\u2019s an interesting and fun-loving guy.\"\n\nDespite the recent buzz about placing the decidedly-not-dull concert pianist, figure skater, and fashion icon Condoleezza Rice on the ticket, the Republican party seems to favor a cautious approach this year. Republican strategist John Weaver stated, \"Boring is the most logical choice for Romney. Given the way the base so hates this president, they are going to be motivated regardless of who the vice president nominee is. So it makes more sense for him to go with [the] safer choice.\"\n\nTerry Holt, a Republican presidential campaign veteran and strategist, added, \"Just because someone seems interesting or flashy, that doesn\u2019t qualify them to be vice president. It\u2019s common for activists to try to reach for the brass ring, to hope for someone who will somehow end up being the silver bullet to victory. Ultimately, for Romney, it\u2019s his leadership attributes that will determine whether or not people vote for him\u2014not who he picks for a running mate.\"",
    " Title: Pence Tapped as Trump's 'Reassuring' Figure in 2020 Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nMike Pence, the Vice President of the United States, is being positioned as a key figure in President Donald Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, with a focus on appealing to suburban voters and women who may have reservations about Trump's personality. This strategy is a response to the Republican Party's losses in higher-income suburban areas during the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nAccording to a recent poll by Morning Consult, Trump's favorability among registered voters, suburban residents, and women is significantly lower than Pence's. The poll found that Trump's favorability is -15 among registered voters, -14 among suburban residents, and -25 among women, while Pence's favorability is -6, -7, -16, respectively, in these categories.\n\nPence's folksy Midwestern charm is seen as disarming suburban women who may be put off by Trump's behavior. He has also been effective in appealing to white evangelical Christians, a demographic that quickly coalesced behind Trump when he chose Pence as his running mate in 2016.\n\nThe strategy of using Pence as a counterbalance to Trump's more brash personality is not new, and it is being described as a \"good cop, bad cop\" approach. Pence is expected to focus on smaller, more intimate settings, while Trump will handle larger rallies and unscripted media appearances.\n\nThe Trump campaign's strategy is based on the understanding that Trump's personality may be a liability with the exact voters they need to win over. This has led to speculation about potential running mates like Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and Trump Cabinet member, who could be more effective in courting women and suburban voters. However, Trump has denied any interest in swapping out his running mate.\n\nCampaign officials say Trump recognizes that Pence can connect with suburban women and voters over kitchen-table issues that matter most to them, and that his calm demeanor allows him to foster those connections in a way that doesn't obscure the substance. This extends to rhetoric, with Pence taking a more measured approach compared to Trump's more bombastic style.\n\nIn other words, Pence is seen as the retail politician, while Trump is the star. Their alliance is both unusual and advantageous, but it is not unlike past presidential tickets where vice presidents were chosen because of their electoral potency, not because of the wisdom or policy chops they would bring to the White House.",
    " Title: Presidential Debate Moderators Face Criticism for Bias in Second Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the context of baseball, three strikes signify the end of a batter's turn at bat. In the presidential debates, however, three debates, including the second presidential debate and a vice-presidential debate held on October 4, mark the beginning of a prolonged series of discussions. The moderators for Sunday night's debate, Anderson Cooper from CNN and Martha Raddatz from ABC, were criticized for perceived bias during the event.\n\nDuring the debate, both candidates discussed each other's treatment of women, with Hillary Clinton questioning Donald Trump's fitness to be president and Trump countering by naming the victims of Bill Clinton's sexual advances and stating that Clinton should be ashamed of herself regarding their treatment.\n\nThe debate was met with criticism from various media outlets, with some describing it as \"brutal\" and \"depressing.\" CNN's senior media correspondent Brian Stelter compared the debate to professional wrestling, while CBS's Bob Schieffer referred to it as \"WrestleMania.\"\n\nThe moderators were accused of interrupting and speaking for Clinton, with Anderson Cooper asking four follow-up questions aimed at skewering Trump on a recent video controversy regarding offensive comments he made on an open mic. Martha Raddatz also lost her composure during the debate, leading to an embarrassing exchange.\n\nTwitter exploded with criticism of Raddatz, with Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich stating, \"Why is Raddatz debating Trump? Isn't that Hillary's job?\"\n\nDuring the debate, Trump promised to call for a special prosecutor for Clinton's email scandal and stated that she would be \"in jail.\" CNN's Dana Bash later compared Trump to African dictators, Stalin, and Hitler for the comment.\n\nReaction to the debate was predictably polarized, with media research center president Brent Bozell criticizing the obvious debate bias when the issue of Russia trying to influence the election came up. Clinton foreign policy spokesman Jesse Lehrich used Twitter to tell Trump to \"go f--k himself,\" while Politico reporter Louis Nelson took the pro-Raddatz media line.\n\nDebate panels were mixed about the result, with pollster Frank Luntz giving the win to Trump, while CNN's poll showed a 57% to 34% lead for Clinton.\n\nThe debate involved questions from 40 \"uncommitted\" voters selected by Gallup. However, it is unclear how anyone could be considered uncommitted with just 30 days to go until November 8. The debate also featured four Clinton accusers in the front row as a testament to how they had been treated by both Bill and Hillary Clinton.",
    " Title: Senate Immigration Bill Clears Key Hurdle, Awaits Final Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nA Senate immigration proposal has garnered enough votes to clear a key hurdle, though some lawmakers continue to vote as of Monday evening. The measure, which is an amendment to the main bill, needs 60 votes to pass. As of Monday, supporters of the proposal have attracted at least 66 votes.\n\nThe measure being voted on Monday is a bipartisan compromise amendment that is considered a key test of whether the bill itself has enough support to pass the full chamber. The amendment, touted by supporters as a border security compromise, includes provisions for an unprecedented surge of security on the border, according to the sponsors behind the amendment.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid anticipates the bill will pass with between 68 and 71 votes. Tensions were high ahead of the vote, with some conservative Republicans acknowledging the bill is likely to pass the Senate but warning that the House is another matter.\n\nPresident Obama is also hosting a meeting at the White House with business leaders to discuss immigration reform and push for support of the bill among the business community. The bill would provide a years-long path to citizenship for the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants currently living in the U.S.\n\nSome conservative groups have been skeptical of the amendment, with the Heritage Foundation warning that it would allow illegal immigrants to \"receive amnesty now\" with the possibility of more border security \"somewhere down the road.\"\n\nThe bill's future in the House remains uncertain, with House Speaker John Boehner facing pressure from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers and conservative groups. If the bill passes the Senate, Boehner will be faced with honoring the will of the majority of House Republicans who do not appear to want to pass the legislation or honoring the majority of the chamber that appears to want at least a full floor vote.\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have argued that Congress should take a more step-by-step approach, starting with further securing the U.S.-Mexico border. \"It could take years to implement the border-security measures,\" Lee said.\n\nThe bill's sponsors are trying to gather 70 votes to show the bill has widespread bipartisan support in the Democrat-controlled chamber and to give it momentum as it heads into the Republican-controlled House. Last week, senators proposed the so-called Border Surge amendment, which included 70,000 additional U.S. border agents and 700 more miles of border fencing, to garner support from lawmakers who said the influx of illegal immigrants remains a problem.",
    " Title: Facebook Removes 1.5 Million Videos of New Zealand Mosque Shooting, Police Response Time Clarified\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook has removed or blocked 1.5 million videos of the shooting rampage at two New Zealand mosques that resulted in the deaths of 50 people and injuries to dozens more. Mia Garlick, spokeswoman for Facebook New Zealand, stated that approximately 300,000 videos were removed within the first 24 hours of the terrorist attack on Friday. Over 1.2 million videos were blocked at upload, according to Garlick.\n\nIn a tweet, Garlick said, \"Out of respect for the people affected by this tragedy and the concerns of local authorities, we're also removing all edited versions of the video that do not show graphic content.\" Facebook is using technology and personnel \"around the clock\" to remove content that violates its violence policy.\n\nMinutes before the attack, the alleged shooter posted a 74-page manifesto on Twitter and sent it to numerous officials and media outlets in New Zealand. The gunman also livestreamed the rampage via helmet cam on Facebook and Twitter. Footage of the massacre circulated for hours after the shooting, despite efforts by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit to take it down as quickly as possible. Twitter and YouTube said they were continuously monitoring and removing any content depicting the tragedy.\n\nYouTube tweeted within hours of the attack, \"Our hearts are broken over today\u2019s terrible tragedy in New Zealand. Please know we are working vigilantly to remove any violent footage.\" Twitter issued a statement citing its \"rigorous processes and a dedicated team\" that activates in such emergencies. The site also stressed that it cooperates with law enforcement investigations.\n\nChurch services and candlelight vigils were taking place across the nation of fewer than 5 million people on Sunday. Dozens of people wounded in the assault on the Al Noor and Linwood mosques remained hospitalized.\n\nNew Zealand Police on Sunday released some details of the initial response to the attack. New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush said in a statement, \"There has been some speculation around the Police response times to the first attack. To clarify, police received its first 111 call at 1.41pm. The first armed police unit was on scene at 1.47pm. That\u2019s six minutes to respond.\"\n\nThe department's highly trained Armed Offenders Squad arrived with 10 minutes, and the 28-year-old suspect was in custody within 36 minutes, Bush said. \"I am very proud of the police response to this terrible attack,\" he added.",
    " Title: Court Rules Against Compensation for Homeowner Whose House Was Destroyed in Police Raid\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal appeals court has ruled that a Colorado homeowner, Leo Lech, is not entitled to compensation for the destruction of his home during a police raid in 2015. The raid, which left Lech and his family homeless, was not related to any of the family members. The family was not home when an armed shoplifter broke into their house on South Alton Street in Greenwood Village.\n\nThe two-day operation, which involved the use of high-caliber rifles, chemical agents, flash-bang grenades, remote-controlled robots, armored vehicles, breaching rams, and an armored vehicle driving through the home's front door, left the house unlivable. Greenwood Village condemned the structure, forcing Lech to have it torn down, and the city offered a measly $5,000 to cover the damage.\n\nLech's lawsuit, which has been ongoing for several years, claimed the city was liable under the Constitution's takings clause, which forbids governments from taking private property for public use without \"just compensation.\" A federal district court ruled in 2016 that the city was not liable, and the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed in a ruling issued on Wednesday. The three judges stated that police cannot be held liable for damage caused while trying to apprehend a suspect.\n\nLech received a $345,000 payout from his homeowner's insurance, but this was not enough to cover the full value of the home, which was appraised for $580,000. The payout also did not cover the costs of demolition or the loss of other property inside the home. Lech ended up having to take out a $390,000 loan to cover the costs of rebuilding.\n\nLech and his attorneys told The Denver Post that they plan to appeal the decision to a full panel on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and could eventually take the case to the Supreme Court. The details of the appeal are not currently available.",
    " Title: Gallery Owners Settle Discrimination Lawsuit Over Same-Sex Wedding\n\nArticle:\n\nA dispute between a gallery owner and a same-sex couple who were denied service for their wedding ceremony in 2013 has been resolved through arbitration. The gallery, G\u00f6rtz Haus, is owned by Mr. and Mrs. Odgaard, a long-established couple who have since closed their business.\n\nThe couple, Lee Stafford and Jared Ellars, had initially booked their wedding at G\u00f6rtz Haus but found themselves in a predicament when their hotel went bankrupt two months before the event. They approached G\u00f6rtz Haus for an alternative venue, and after a 45-minute meeting, the Odgaards declined their request, citing religious beliefs.\n\nMr. Ellars, 35, a database administrator, and Mr. Stafford, 43, a business systems analyst, claim that the Odgaards only revealed their reasons for denying service when they inquired about the nature of the wedding. According to the couple, Mr. Odgaard stated, \"I can't take your money, and we don't do anything for free.\"\n\nThe couple, who have been together for 13 years, never intended for the Odgaards' business to suffer as a result of the incident. Instead, they hoped the gallery owners would cease discriminating against same-sex couples. The settlement required the Odgaards to pay $5,000 to Mr. Stafford and Mr. Ellars, which they donated to an anti-bullying program for gay students.\n\nThe wedding ceremony was held in a barn, officiated by a minister from the Disciples of Christ church, which Mr. Stafford attends. To this day, Mr. Stafford remains troubled by the ongoing debate over religious liberty, stating, \"Their religious beliefs say they don't approve of gay marriage, but my religious beliefs say that we can. Why does their religion trump mine?\"",
    " Title: Progressive Split Among New Hampshire Democrats as Sanders Mulls 2020 Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the spring of 2015, before Bernie Sanders had a campaign office in New Hampshire, Elizabeth Ropp, an acupuncturist, was making homemade signs for the Vermont senator. \"Bernie inspired me because, as someone who's lived without health insurance for most of my adult life, I want there to be a single-payer health care system,\" she said.\n\nRopp was disappointed Sanders was not the nominee and is convinced that if he had been, Donald Trump would not be president. \"I want to see Bernie run again in 2020,\" said Ropp. \"We need Bernie to run even if the field is crowded.\"\n\nThe 77-year-old Vermont senator has not announced his plans, but he has sparked plenty of speculation. In 2016, Sanders created a powerful progressive movement in a thin primary field. The dilemma for him now is that nearly every other Democratic presidential contender is adopting his positions on issues like health care and minimum wage, which means progressive voters in 2020 have plenty of other choices.\n\nEarlier this month, when Sanders reintroduced a bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, every Democrat in the Senate who's rumored to be considering a run for president co-sponsored his legislation: Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nArnie Arnesen, a radio show host and former New Hampshire politician who thinks of herself as Sanders' ideological twin, says she's grateful that he ran in 2016 because he helped \"expose some of the rot\" in her own party. Sanders has helped change the Democratic National Committee rules for selecting a nominee, curtailing the role of superdelegates and shaping the current Democratic economic message. However, Arnesen wonders whether he's the right candidate for the White House.\n\n\"My question is, does he provide added value in this campaign for 2020? Or are there a lot of people who sort of carry very similar messages?\" asked Arnesen, before answering her own question. \"Does it have to be him? I don't think it does, and I admire him. I admire him to pieces.\"\n\nThe clearest example of the change is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who resigned as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee so she could endorse Sanders in the 2016 primary. Gabbard recently launched her own presidential bid.\n\nSanders' first decisive victory in 2016 came in the New Hampshire primary; he crushed Hillary Clinton there by 22 percentage points. And activists like Andru Volinsky were part of the reason he did so well. Volinsky, Sanders' New Hampshire campaign lawyer during the 2016 primary, said that if the Vermont senator were to run for president again, he would be his top choice.\n\nHowever, it's unclear whether Volinsky personally wants Sanders to run. \"I want a strong advocate for addressing issues like income inequality and health care access and climate action,\" said Volinsky. \"Sen. Sanders could be that strong voice. There are some others that could as well.\"\n\nMany voters who strongly backed Sanders in 2016 say they realize Sanders is not necessarily the only progressive option in 2020. For some, that's confusing, but for others, it's appealing.\n\nArnesen is excited by many of the candidates considering a run for the presidency; many of them, she believes, carry elements of Sanders' message. For example, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, she says, has a lot of the same \"authenticity\" as Sanders \"without being 80 years old\" when he's elected (Sanders turns 79 in 2020).\n\n\"I think it's time for us to start creating a new bench,\" said Arnesen. \"And the new bench isn't old, it should not be white, and it probably should not be male.\"\n\nSome Sanders supporters also say the political environment has changed since 2016, and they want a candidate who can win. \"Electability has leaped to the forefront for me,\" said Ron Abramson, an immigration lawyer who served as a Sanders delegate to the DNC. \"I am prepared to support anyone who can help restore some measure of sanity [and] humanity.\"\n\n\"We're looking for somebody right now who can stand up to the nasty, nasty campaign that our idiot-in-chief the president is going to run in 2020,\" said Bill Stelling, an activist who runs an art gallery in Manchester. Stelling is not convinced Sanders is the right person for that job.\n\nEven though he was \"hugely inspired\" by Sanders' message in 2016 and donated to the Vermont senator's campaign, these days, he's impressed with California Sen. Kamala Harris; he thinks she's \"fearless.\" He's also intrigued by Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who tried to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz last year. This week, Stelling is going to a \"Draft Beto\" house party. He wanted to spread the word, so he posted a note about the meeting on Facebook, but was disheartened by the response.\n\n\"I immediately got some snarky comments from progressives,\" said Stelling. \"It's so counterproductive.\"\n\nBut loyal Sanders supporters are unyielding in their devotion to the Vermont senator, because, they insist, he is the only one pushing the Democratic Party to the left. \"The other candidates are trying to posture themselves based on the assumption that Bernie Sanders is going to run,\" said Tim Smith, a four-term state legislator in Manchester and early Sanders supporter in the 2016 primary. \"They don't want to be seen as being members of the conservative wing of the party.\"",
    " Title: Republican Divide on Abortion Laws: Trump, Romney, and McCarthy Disagree on Exceptions\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Pro-life laws are gaining momentum across the United States, from Alabama to Missouri. However, a growing divide among Republicans is emerging over the extent to which these laws should go.\n\nRecently, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to celebrate his pro-life victories. In a tweet, he stated, \"I am strongly pro-life, with the three exceptions of rape, incest, and protecting the life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan.\"\n\nThis statement has sparked debate, as Trump is not alone in questioning the recent pro-life laws. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) told CNN's State of the Union, \"I do not support the Alabama law. I believe there ought to be exceptions. I am pro-life, but there ought to be exceptions.\"\n\nSimilarly, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) stated, \"In my whole political career, I also believed in (exceptions for) rape, incest, or life of the mother. There was exceptions, that's exactly what Republicans have voted on in this House.\"\n\nFor some pro-life advocates, the recent laws are seen as an opening battle for a potential Supreme Court fight. Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life of America stated, \"Actually, for the future of our country, Roe is destined to become a historical footnote.\"\n\nAlabama state Rep. Terri Collins added, \"No law is constitutional until the Supreme Court actually revisits Roe v Wade.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has been vocal about its commitment to the pro-life cause, with Vice President Mike Pence recently telling graduates of Liberty University, \"We stand without apology for the sanctity of human life.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates are also engaging in the debate. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) hope to codify Roe v Wade into federal law. Gillibrand told CBS' Face the Nation, \"President Trump has started a war on America's women. If it's a fight he wants to have, it's a fight he's going to have.\"\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) vowed in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press, \"If you are asking me would I ever appoint a Supreme Court justice who does not believe in defending Roe v Wade, who does not believe a woman has a right to control her own body, I will never do that.\"\n\nThis week, the justices will decide whether to hear a case out of Indiana requiring women to get an ultrasound 18 hours before an abortion.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Senators Express Optimism for Immigration Reform Amidst Shifting Republican Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan group of senators expressed confidence on Monday in their proposal for major immigration reform. However, after the last significant congressional push failed in 2007, many are questioning why it would work this time around.\n\nDuring a press conference, Republican Sen. John McCain, when asked by CNN's Dana Bash about the optimism, responded, \"Elections, elections.\" He further explained, \"The Republican Party is losing the support of our Hispanic citizens, and we realize that there are many issues on which we think we are in agreement with our Hispanic citizens, but this is a preeminent issue with those citizens.\"\n\nIn the 2012 presidential election, President Obama received 71% of the Latino vote compared to Mitt Romney's 27%. The Latino vote for Republicans has also trended down over the last three presidential elections. In 2008, 31% supported McCain, while 44% of the voting bloc turned out for then-President George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nSince Election Day, leading Republicans have taken a noticeably different tune on immigration, with many stating that the party needs to adjust its messaging on the issue to appeal to a broader base.\n\nSpeaking later in the day on CNN's \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,\" McCain argued that he's not sure \"politics\" is entirely behind the shift, but \"if we continue to polarize the Latino/Hispanic vote, the demographics indicate that our chances for being in the majority are minimal.\"\n\nPolls during the election indicated that the economy\u2014not immigration\u2014was the top issue for Latino voters. A CNN poll conducted a little more than a month before the election showed that 44% of Latino adults rated the economy as their top issue, while immigration policy came in a distant second at 14%. Asked to choose between the economy and immigration, nearly three-quarters of Latinos \u2013 74% \u2013 said the economy was more important.\n\nHowever, more than three-quarters of Latino voters in exit polls said that undocumented immigrants should be offered the chance to apply for legal status.\n\nAlong with elections, McCain acknowledged other reasons for the renewed drive on illegal immigration legislation\u2014saying \"we can't forever have 11 million people live in the shadows\"\u2014but he also predicted a bumpy road ahead.\n\n\"Let me emphasize, there will still be fights. There will still be battles,\" he said on CNN. \"But I am more confident now that I have ever been that we can reach an agreement and have a bill signed by the president.\"",
    " Title: Ilhan Omar's Controversial Remarks on Israel and the Jewish Lobby\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Ilhan Omar's recent comments regarding the influence of the Jewish lobby in U.S. politics have sparked a heated debate, with critics accusing her of promoting the ancient smear of wealthy Jews buying influence, while some defenders argue she is accurately describing the power of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).\n\nIn a tweet, Omar responded to a comment by journalist Glenn Greenwald about House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy's threat to punish Omar and fellow Muslim representative Rashida Tlaib over their criticisms of Israel. This led to an exchange with a writer for The Forward, resulting in a firestorm of criticism from both parties.\n\nIn a recent article, the author defends Omar and Tlaib against McCarthy's attacks but criticizes Omar's use of the term \"Jewish lobby\" to describe pro-Israel attitudes in the U.S. The author argues that Omar's remarks play into stereotypes that aid Republican efforts to suggest that any criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies is on a slippery slope that leads to passing around copies of the anti-Semitic text, \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\"\n\nThe author explains that Americans' pro-Israel attitudes are largely due to acute and widespread awareness of the Holocaust and Jewish statelessness, as well as religious perspectives that make America more pro-Israel than similar but more secular countries. A particularly large and politically active group of conservative American Evangelical Christians, who identify with Jews and place the State of Israel at the center of their vision of global salvation, have become the single most important constituency in the Republican Party's base.\n\nThe author also notes that the idea that it's \"Jewish money\" or \"the Jewish lobby\" that is the main reason for the Republican Party's move towards Israel is a distraction from the real reasons and furthers the argument that one must choose between Netanyahu, settlements, and Greater Israel on the one hand, or anti-Semitism on the other. The author argues that if Omar understands this, she should make it clear before she inadvertently becomes a casualty in the war of anti-Muslim extremists against anyone seeking peace and justice in the Middle East.\n\nThe author also cites a 2018 piece from The Forward, which notes that Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Israel was part of a long-term strategy by conservative white Christian evangelicals driving American policy toward Israel and the Palestinians. These evangelicals believe that Jews, and only Jews, must rule over Jerusalem to herald the return of Jesus Christ, and their absolute fealty toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and their antipathy toward the Palestinians are reflected in the itinerary for Pence's trip. The article concludes that the idea that it's \"Jewish money\" or \"the Jewish lobby\" that is the main reason for the Republican Party's move towards Israel is an absolute distraction from the real reasons and furthers the argument that one must choose between Netanyahu, settlements, and Greater Israel on the one hand, or anti-Semitism on the other.",
    " Title: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren Announces Exploratory Committee for 2020 Presidential Run\n\nArticle:\n\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has formally announced the establishment of an exploratory committee, marking a significant step towards her potential candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election. In a video emailed to supporters on New Year's Eve, Warren made a populist political appeal, emphasizing her middle-class background and her work on consumer financial protections.\n\nWarren argued that the middle class is \"under attack\" from corporations and the right, including President Trump, whom she vowed to defeat in 2020. She stated, \"Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. And they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.\"\n\nSenator Warren's potential strengths in the anticipated crowded contest include her track record of addressing economic concerns and her willingness to confront President Trump. However, she is a polarizing figure who may face challenges in crafting her own narrative, as she has become a target for conservatives, who portray her as a liberal elitist due to her background as a Harvard law professor.\n\nPrior to her 2012 election to the Senate, Warren had never held elected office. Since then, she has been a liberal icon, instrumental in the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and known for her outspoken criticism of the banking industry.\n\nDuring her years as a senator, Warren is best recognized for her sharp questioning of financial executives. In 2016, she famously told the then-CEO of Wells Fargo to resign for overseeing the bank during a time when it created fake accounts.\n\nSpeculation about Warren running for president began shortly after her Senate election in 2012. In 2016, many progressive groups urged her to run for president, and her hometown newspaper, the Boston Globe, even ran an editorial arguing that \"Democrats need Elizabeth Warren's voice in the 2016 presidential race.\"\n\nWarren declined the opportunity in 2016, but four years later, she is now ready. However, she will face a larger field, including potential progressive favorites like Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and several other senators expected to join the race. Approximately two dozen Democrats are expected to run for president this cycle, including a number of women and candidates of color.\n\nIn a statement, Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, said, \"Senator Elizabeth Warren's formal entrance into the 2020 race for President today helps launch what we believe will be a vibrant discussion of bold, inclusive populist ideas in the Democratic Primary.\" In 2014 and 2015, DFA worked with Moveon.org to encourage Warren to run for president.\n\nWarren's entry into the contest to challenge President Trump in 2020 is a development he is likely to relish. Trump has frequently mocked Warren, derisively calling her \"Pocahontas,\" a reference to her 2012 campaign against Republican Scott Brown when he claimed she had misrepresented her family's Cherokee heritage for professional gain. In October 2018, Warren released the results of a DNA test showing that she did have Native American ancestry going back several generations. The Cherokee Nation, however, called the DNA testing \"useless.\"\n\nThe incident was intended to quiet critics, but it quickly became a cultural faux pas of its own. Trump's taunting did not end, and even some Democrats accused Warren of misunderstanding the complexity of race and identity.\n\nWarren appears to target voters of varied cultural, geographic, and economic backgrounds with an anti-corporate, pro-worker message in her initial campaign pitch. One of the biggest criticisms of Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 bid was a focus on appealing to specific demographic groups, which some argue alienated white, working-class voters who helped elect Trump. In her launch video, Warren touched on her working-class childhood in Oklahoma, discussing how her mother got a minimum wage job at Sears when her father got sick, in order to keep the family in their house.",
    " Title: Obama Pushes for Global Climate Pact at Paris Summit, Faces Domestic Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has embarked on a mission to secure a global climate accord at the ongoing two-week conference in Paris, where over 150 world leaders are negotiating an agreement aimed at curbing an increase in global temperatures. In his opening remarks, Obama described the meeting as a potential \"turning point\" in the global fight against climate change.\n\nIn his address, Obama emphasized the urgency of the challenge and the potential for human action to address it. He stated, \"What should give us hope that this is a turning point, that this is the moment we finally determined we would save our planet, is the fact that our nations share a sense of urgency about this challenge and a growing realization that it is within our power to do something about it.\"\n\nThe Paris summit takes place in the aftermath of the devastating terror attacks in the city, and some Republicans have criticized Obama for focusing too much on global warming and not enough on security. However, Obama, in his remarks, characterized the negotiations as an \"act of defiance\" towards the attackers.\n\nObama also met one-on-one with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, two of the world's largest carbon emitters, on the sidelines of the summit. In addition, he held discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin to address security matters.\n\nDomestically, Obama faces opposition from congressional Republicans and several states concerned that his proposals will result in job losses. The president has pledged that the U.S. will cut its overall emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2030, with a focus on reducing emissions from U.S. power plants. However, half the states are suing to block the power plant rules, claiming Obama has exceeded his authority under the Clean Air Act.\n\nFurthermore, Republicans in Congress are threatening to block U.S. dollars for the U.N. Green Climate Fund, a fund designed to aid poorer countries in combating climate change. The Paris conference aims to secure the most comprehensive deal ever to tackle global warming. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the last major agreement, required only rich countries to cut emissions, and the U.S. did not sign on.\n\nAmong the sticking points in the negotiations is the allocation of funds for climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as the potential impact on traditional oil and gas producers. At least 19 governments and 28 leading world investors have announced billions of dollars in investments for clean energy technology research and development.\n\nIn addition to climate change discussions, Obama and Putin also addressed the Syrian civil war and the recent downing of a Russian jet by Turkey, with Obama expressing regret for the loss of Russian lives and reiterating U.S. support for de-escalation between Russia and Turkey. Obama also reiterated that Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad must leave power as part of any political transition.",
    " Title: House Freedom Caucus Members Call for Removal of Rep. Adam Schiff as Impeachment Inquiry Leader\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus members have demanded the removal of Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, from leading the impeachment inquiry. In a letter, 19 Caucus members, including new Chairman Andy Biggs, stated that Mr. Schiff cannot be trusted to lead the investigation due to his interactions with the whistleblower who filed a complaint before the impeachment inquiry began.\n\nThe letter alleges that Mr. Schiff's interactions with the whistleblower make him a potential fact witness and unfit for the serious responsibility of leading the investigation. The New York Times reported that the whistleblower, who accused President Trump of trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter, first approached an intelligence committee staffer who then relayed some \"vague\" information to Mr. Schiff. The committee aide then directed the whistleblower, per standard protocol, to Michael Atkinson, the inspector-general for the intelligence community.\n\nMr. Schiff stated last month that his team has not spoken directly with the whistleblower. However, media reports this week contradict that account, with The New York Times and others reporting the whistleblower had reached out to a House Intelligence Committee aide before filing the complaint.\n\nRep. Biggs accused Mr. Schiff of using the Ukraine allegations as a \"fairy tale\" to impeach the president. \"Mr. Schiff is hardly an unbiased arbiter of this unauthorized impeachment process, and we call for his immediate recusal,\" he said.\n\nIn the letter, the Republicans argue that Mr. Schiff should be questioned himself regarding his interactions with the whistleblower. They also argue that Democrats demanded Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and the previous head of the intelligence panel, recuse himself from the Russia investigation because of his private meetings with a source.\n\nLast week, Mr. Schiff accused Republicans of merely trying to protect the president. \"Republicans continued the president's strategy of deflection by making the absurd claim that because a whistleblower contacted the committee seeking guidance, the committee can not conduct an investigation into the complaint,\" Mr. Schiff said. \"If that were true, no whistleblower could contact Congress and no committee could conduct an investigation,\" he continued. \"What the Republicans fear most is the truth. To avoid the facts, they stage confusion, undermine the Constitution, and attack the person the President fears most, Adam Schiff.\"",
    " Title: President Trump's Media Relationships Remain Complex Despite White House Efforts to Downplay Ties\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's media relationships have remained complex, with some of his old ties persisting despite White House efforts to downplay their significance. According to several news outlets, including Bloomberg News, Trump has allegedly sworn off watching MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" and many of his favorite CNN programs. However, on the morning of his well-received speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump reportedly spent 15 minutes chatting with Joe Scarborough, the host of \"Morning Joe,\" in the Oval Office. An MSNBC spokesperson confirmed the meeting.\n\nThe apparent disconnect between some aides' insistence that Trump is taking his feud with the media seriously enough to turn off the TV, and his tendency to grant access to hosts of his favorite shows, suggests that aides have not yet figured out how to curb their boss's habits.\n\nTrump's relationship with Scarborough isn't the only one of the president's old ties that his aides have tried to downplay. Trump's aides and advisers have declared that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is not that close to the president and has lost clout since he was unceremoniously ousted from leading the transition team shortly after the Nov. 8 election. However, Trump frequently calls Christie to ask his opinion on the administration's performance and to kibbitz about New York or whatever is happening that day, according to several people close to Trump with knowledge of the conversations.\n\nThe president also sought to appoint Christie as labor secretary after Trump's first nominee, Andrew Puzder, dropped out, even though some of his top advisers disapproved of the move. Christie declined the offer.\n\nAides have also tried to de-emphasize the president's friendship with Chris Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax Television, who, in a CNN appearance last month, criticized Chief of Staff Reince Priebus as ineffective. \"Don't listen to Ruddy,\" one senior administration official said after Ruddy's appearance. \"He's trying to get attention. Trying to be important.\"\n\nRuddy, who has known Trump for more than a decade, talks to the president frequently\u2014including a 30-minute meeting in the Oval Office on Wednesday. And some of Trump's aides feared that Ruddy was speaking on the president's behalf when he criticized Priebus on television, because the two men had seen each other for 30 minutes the night before at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nRuddy told The New York Times that he was speaking only for himself, and that Priebus had called him after the interview to ask him to keep an \u201copen mind.\u201d A week later, Priebus and Steve Bannon had a long dinner with Ruddy, according to a person familiar with the event.\n\nSome in the White House have balked at Anthony Scaramucci, the New York financier who is disliked by some of the president's aides. But Scaramucci has the president's cellphone number and continues to speak to him, according to people familiar with their calls.\n\nCorey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, who was purged last summer, still occasionally talks to the president and came in for a meeting last week with Trump, several people familiar with the calls and the meeting say. Some people familiar with the meeting said Lewandowski's continued relationship with Trump is frustrating for West Wing aides. Lewandowski declined to comment.\n\nOne senior White House official disclaimed any knowledge of Trump's calls with Christie and Scaramucci, but did not deny that they occurred. Trump keeps his own cellphone and is often alone in the West Wing at night, where he answers calls and dials people. He will sometimes ask his secretary to set up a meeting or put him on the phone with someone after seeing that person on TV.\n\n\"He talks to people in New York that his aides in the White House have no clue who they even are,\" said a person who regularly talks to Trump. \"They've never even met some of these people, but the president listens to them.\"\n\nThe White House official confirmed Trump often calls people after seeing them on television, either to thank them for their comments or to engage further about the topic of discussion. \"That\u2019s true, he\u2019s done that for 40 years,\" the White House official said, adding that it\u2019s \"a great thing that he communicates with a lot of different people.\"",
    " Title: Obama Signs Defense Bill, Issues Statements on Controversial Provisions\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has signed into law a $633.3 billion defense bill, which includes a statement indicating his intention to interpret the law as he sees fit on various issues, such as the transfer of terrorism detainees and the military's policy on gay service members.\n\nIn a \"signing statement\" released Wednesday, Mr. Obama agreed with the \"vast majority\" of provisions in the 680-page law but expressed disagreement with some sections. He had earlier threatened to veto the bill if certain objectionable provisions survived.\n\nNotably, Mr. Obama objected to Section 1027, which renews the prohibition against transferring detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba to the United States. He argued that this provision violates constitutional separation of powers principles and could lead to constitutional conflicts.\n\nAnother contentious issue addressed in the statement is the military's policy on homosexuality and the gay lifestyle. Mr. Obama stated that a provision giving service members and military chaplains the legal right to oppose homosexuality, as long as their opposition does not interfere with good order and discipline in the military, is \"unnecessary and ill-advised.\"\n\nThe president also objected to a provision that blocks proposed increases in health insurance fees for service members, stating that it could result in deeper cuts to military personnel.\n\nThe bill also includes provisions tightening penalties on Iran and enhancing security at U.S. diplomatic posts, in response to the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, last September.\n\nDespite his veto threat, Mr. Obama signed the law due to the critical defense authorities and funding it provides, which he deemed too important to ignore. The measure also contains defense spending cuts agreed upon by the president and congressional Republicans in August 2011.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Debate Gun Control in Wake of Colorado Shooting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the mass shooting in Colorado that left 12 people dead and 58 others injured, the debate over stricter gun-control laws has resurfaced. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, declined to comment on whether Colorado should revisit its gun laws, stating that the shooting suspect, James Holmes, would have found a way to create \"horror\" even if he hadn't been able to acquire guns.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney confirmed that President Obama's views on gun-control laws have not changed. He stated that the president's focus is on keeping guns out of the hands of those who should not have them under existing law.\n\nGun-control advocates, such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), have pointed to the types of weapons allegedly used by Holmes, a 24-year-old doctoral student at the University of Colorado, in the shooting at an Aurora theater during a midnight showing of \"The Dark Knight Rises.\" Holmes was armed with a 100-round rifle magazine, among other weapons.\n\nSen. Feinstein called for a \"sane\" debate about banning military-style assault weapons, citing the powerful weapon used in the shooting and the high number of casualties despite a quick police response. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY), a leading gun-control advocate, stated that mass shooters have one thing in common: a gun that can be loaded with large amounts of ammunition.\n\nHowever, some lawmakers, such as Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Colorado Governor Hickenlooper, argue that the issue is not about guns but about individuals who would find ways to commit acts of violence regardless of the tools available to them.\n\nWhile the Colorado shooting has reignited the gun control debate, little is known about the suspect's motivations. Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan stated that Holmes had given no hint of the rampage he is suspected of embarking on. Hickenlooper described Holmes as \"clearly deranged, twisted, demonic in some way,\" with a goal to create terror.",
    " Title: Obama Orders Paid Sick Leave for Government Contractors, Criticizes Republican Candidates on Union Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Monday, mandating that government contractors offer their workers seven days of paid sick leave per year. The order, signed during a flight to Boston, will affect approximately 300,000 workers starting in 2017.\n\nWorkers on government contracts will earn a minimum of one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. Contractors have the discretion to offer more generous amounts.\n\nSpeaking at a union event in Boston, Obama emphasized the benefits of such policies and advocated for additional worker-friendly measures, such as paid maternity leave. He joked about the U.S. being the only advanced nation on Earth that does not guarantee paid maternity leave.\n\nObama made indirect references to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for their anti-union remarks and policies without naming them. In response, Governor Walker stated, \"It\u2019s clear he stands with the big government union bosses while we stand with the people.\"\n\nThe executive order is part of a series of measures by the White House to expand access to paid leave. In January, Obama issued a presidential memorandum directing the government to advance up to six weeks of paid sick leave for the birth or adoption of a child, or for other sick leave-eligible uses.\n\nObama is also pressing Congress to pass legislation giving government employees six additional weeks of paid parental leave. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez could not provide an estimate of the cost of implementing the seven-day paid leave rule for contractors.\n\nDuring the trip to Boston, Obama also renewed his call for Congress to pass the Healthy Families Act, which would require all businesses with 15 or more employees to offer up to seven paid sick days each year. According to the White House, an estimated 44 million private-sector workers, about 40 percent of the total private-sector workforce, do not have access to paid sick leave.",
    " Title: IRS Targeting of Conservative Groups Extends Beyond Cincinnati Office, New Evidence Suggests\n\nArticle:\n\nNew evidence has emerged suggesting that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeting of conservative organizations extended beyond the agency's Cincinnati office, as previously claimed by senior IRS officials. NBC News reported that documents, including those signed by IRS Tax Exempt Organizations Director Lois Lerner, were sent to Tea Party groups, requesting additional information.\n\nAttorneys representing some of the targeted groups have stated that the additional scrutiny did not solely originate in the Cincinnati office, with requests for information coming from other offices and bearing the signatures of higher-ups at the agency. At least one letter requesting information about one of the groups bears the signature of Lois Lerner, the suspended director of the IRS Exempt Organizations department in Washington.\n\nJay Sekulow, an attorney representing 27 conservative political advocacy organizations that applied to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status, provided some of the letters to NBC News. He stated that the groups' contacts with the IRS prove that the practices went beyond a few \"front line\" employees in the Cincinnati office, as the IRS has maintained.\n\nAmong the letters were several that bore return IRS addresses other than Cincinnati, including \"Department of the Treasury / Internal Revenue Service / Washington, D.C.\", and the signatures of IRS officials higher up the chain. Two letters with \"Department of the Treasury / Internal Revenue Service / Washington, D.C.\" letterhead were signed by \"Tax Law Specialist (s)\" from Exempt Organizations Technical Group 1 and Technical Group 2. Lerner's signature, which appeared to be a stamp rather than an actual signature, appeared on a letter requesting additional information from the Ohio Liberty Council Corp.\n\nLerner has been placed on administrative leave after refusing to testify before the House Oversight Committee about the scandal last week. She continues to receive a $180,000 per year, taxpayer-funded paycheck. Lerner was the first to publicly admit IRS targeting of conservatives was in fact taking place.",
    " Title: White House Announces Kathy Kraninger as Nominee for Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Head\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The White House announced on Saturday that President Donald Trump has chosen Kathy Kraninger, an official from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to lead the U.S. consumer watchdog, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The decision is facing criticism from consumer advocates and dividing conservatives.\n\nKraninger, who will succeed interim CFPB head Mick Mulvaney, will need Senate approval to assume the role. If confirmed, she will succeed her current boss, Mick Mulvaney, who was appointed as the temporary head of the CFPB in November to replace Richard Cordray, an appointee of former President Barack Obama.\n\nIn a statement, White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters stated, \"She [Kraninger] will bring a fresh perspective and much-needed management experience to the [bureau], which has been plagued by excessive spending, dysfunctional operations, and politicized agendas.\"\n\nKraninger, who holds a law degree and has worked at the Department of Homeland Security and as a Congressional staffer, did not immediately respond to a LinkedIn message seeking comment on Saturday.\n\nDuring his six-month tenure at the CFPB, Mulvaney, a former Republican Congressman, has overhauled the agency, restructuring departments, shelving new regulations, and dropping cases against payday lenders. At the OMB, Kraninger has worked on financial policy issues for the CFPB, Treasury, and other regulators, and has extensive experience managing large teams in government, according to one person with direct knowledge of her role.\n\nConsumer groups and conservatives alike have criticized the announcement, with both sides questioning whether she is qualified and expressing concerns about her ability to gain Senate approval. Allied Progress, a left-leaning consumer group, stated that Kraninger's nomination was an attempt by Mulvaney to keep a grip on the agency, adding that she has \"no relevant experience.\"\n\nJ.W. Verret, an associate professor at the George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School and financial regulation expert, said in an email that Kraninger was regarded in conservative Republican circles as very \"smart,\" but he also pointed to her lack of consumer finance experience. Other conservatives argued that Mulvaney had a strong track record of picking good managers, and said he would not have backed her if he doubted her capability.\n\n\"Whether you agree with Mulvaney politically, there is no doubt he has been a highly effective manager in government, and since he's worked closely with her, he must know she is qualified,\" said Dina Ellis Rochkind, a lawyer at Paul Hastings and former Congressional staffer who worked for Republican lawmakers. \"But the big test will be how she performs in her Senate confirmation hearing.\"",
    " Title: Education Department Cancels $150 Million in Student Loans, Affecting 15,000 Borrowers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Department of Education announced on Thursday that it will cancel $150 million in federal student loan debt, despite Secretary Betsy DeVos' efforts to overhaul the Obama-era policy. The department will forgive loans for approximately 15,000 borrowers whose schools closed, preventing them from completing their programs.\n\nThree months ago, a federal judge ruled that DeVos' attempts to rescind the 2016 regulations were illegal, as reported by Politico. The judge also rejected for-profit colleges' bid to stop the policy in October.\n\nAbout half of the affected borrowers attended Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit educational chain that closed its campuses in 2015. These borrowers will account for $80 million of the automatically discharged loans, while borrowers whose schools closed between November 1, 2013, and December 4, 2018, will account for the other $70 million.\n\nAffected borrowers will begin receiving email notifications from the department on Friday, according to the department's press release. However, loan discharges may take longer than 90 days to complete, and loan holders will inform borrowers about the specific loans that were forgiven.\n\nPreviously, DeVos argued that the debt forgiveness was too lenient, lacking sufficient borrower proof requirements. The department proposed changes that would reduce frivolous claims and allow colleges to respond to borrower allegations.\n\nIn a separate development, Citibank has been ordered to pay $6.5 million for allegedly harming borrowers with student loan servicing failures. The specifics of this case are not detailed in the provided text.",

This move signals the beginning of an investigation, which is set to commence next year, following the Democrats' anticipated takeover of the House and subsequent acquisition of powers to oversee investigations.\n\nThe request for preservation includes medical records, surveillance videos, and logs of interactions between Border Patrol agents and the children. The order was signed by the top Democrats on the House Judiciary, Oversight, and Homeland Security committees.\n\nIn a joint statement, the lawmakers announced that after the new Congress begins next week, their committees in the House of Representatives will hold hearings and conduct oversight on the two deaths that occurred earlier this month, as well as the conditions under which thousands of children are being held in DHS custody.\n\nAn 8-year-old boy died on Christmas Eve after six days in Border Patrol custody. Felipe Gomez Alonzo had been treated for a cold and fever at a hospital and was released, only to be readmitted hours later and subsequently died. His mother, still in Guatemala, stated that the boy's father brought the youngster on the trip because they believed he would have an easier chance of navigating the American immigration system to gain an illegal foothold in the U.S.\n\nEarlier this month, a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl fell ill hours after being arrested crossing the border illegally with her father. Border Patrol agents managed to revive her twice, but she later suffered a heart attack and liver and respiratory failure at a hospital and died. The specific details regarding the girl's family and the circumstances surrounding her death were not available in the provided text.",
    " Title: Rand Paul's Strategy of Revisiting Clinton Scandals Garners Media Attention, Yet Questions Remain on Its Effectiveness\n\nArticle:\n\nThe strategy of Kentucky Senator and potential 2016 presidential candidate Rand Paul of revisiting decades-old Clinton scandals, particularly the Monica Lewinsky affair, has proven effective in maintaining media attention this winter. By indirectly referencing the Oval Office sex scandal, Paul has managed to spark panel discussions and media articles.\n\nThis week, Paul's attacks were bolstered by the revelation of personal, decades-old correspondences between Hillary Clinton and Diane Blair, a close friend and confidant to the former first lady. The newly uncovered archives, which addressed the Lewinsky scandal and other trials from Bill Clinton's two terms, were presented as significant political news.\n\nFor Clinton critics, there appears to be no downside to the strategy. The media has largely celebrated Paul's Lewinsky-centric approach, with CNN's Candy Crowley describing him as being \"on a roll lately\" and CNN political reporter Peter Hamby claiming Paul's attack on Clinton's personal life represents \"a potent message for Republicans at the moment.\"\n\nHowever, the strategy's effectiveness in boosting Paul's political aspirations is questionable. In a national poll released on Tuesday, a McClatchy-Marist survey of Republican voters found that just 9% of them considered Rand Paul their pick to be the GOP's nominee in 2016. Even some Republican leaders think the Paul strategy is an electoral loser.\n\nAdditionally, a recent Washington Post poll found Clinton to be historically popular for a potential candidate. Yet, pundits continue to discuss supposed hurdles her campaign will face, with terms like \"predestined\" and \"train wreck\" being used to describe her potential candidacy.\n\nDespite the ongoing negative Clinton analysis, the rehashing of Clinton scandals has remained a popular topic in the media. The Beltway press has been eager to cover the story, with the New York Times and CNN characterizing the Blair letters as providing \"fresh insight into the private history of the Clintons\" and \"bringing new insights into how Clinton dealt with White House setbacks,\" respectively.\n\nVeteran columnist Joe Klein, who has written about the Clintons for 30 years, criticized the notion that the Blair letters were big news or that the previously adjudicated sex scandals still matter today. \"If Hillary Clinton does run for President, she should be examined carefully-as a public servant, not as a demonic caricature,\" wrote Klein. \"She's far better than that; I hope we are, too.\"",
    " Title: FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Steps Down Amidst Ongoing Political Pressure and Allegations of Conflict of Interest\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has stepped down from his post on Monday, following weeks of criticism from President Donald Trump and other Republicans, according to people familiar with the matter. McCabe will take the remainder of his vacation time until he is technically eligible to retire from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in March.\n\nMcCabe has faced a steady string of attacks over an alleged conflict of interest stemming from his wife's previous run for Virginia state Senate as a Democrat before he became deputy director. He has denied any conflict.\n\nPresident Trump and other Republicans have cited the alleged conflict as part of a broader assertion of bias on the part of the FBI, the Justice Department, and the special counsel's office as they investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any links between the Trump campaign and Moscow in that effort. Trump has specifically called for McCabe's ouster.\n\nDemocrats say these assertions are an attempt to distract from the investigations and discredit them.\n\nIn an email to employees, FBI Director Chris Wray addressed McCabe's departure, saying he \"will not be swayed by political or other pressure\" in making decisions, according to a person familiar with the message. Wray thanked McCabe for his service, adding that McCabe said he would take leave immediately following a conversation between the two.\n\nThe email was earlier reported by the New York Times.\n\nIn the message, Wray also said he wouldn't comment on a pending report from the Justice Department's inspector general, an in-house watchdog, which is expected to criticize the FBI's handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email arrangement when she was secretary of state. The report is expected to prompt some personnel changes.\n\nMcCabe's decision Monday surprised many inside the FBI and Justice Department. Officials abruptly canceled a press conference to discuss an unrelated criminal operation as news of McCabe's resignation became public minutes before the conference was to begin.\n\nMcCabe, 49 years old, will be succeeded, at least temporarily, by the No. 3 official at the bureau, David Bowdich, one person said.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller has publicly obtained two guilty pleas from Trump campaign aides. He has charged two other Trump campaign officials with tax-related and other offenses related to private work predating the campaign.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community in January 2017 said it believed Russia had conducted an influence operation with the goal of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMcCabe's abrupt departure is the latest event in a highly unusual back-and-forth between the Trump administration and a federal law-enforcement establishment that is both investigating him as it works for him, and cherishes its independence.\n\nThe dueling narratives about the Russia investigation have engulfed multiple senior law-enforcement officials and spilled into a fight in Congress. House Republicans produced a memo earlier this month describing what they say were abuses by U.S. intelligence agencies in the Russia probe. Democrats dismissed the memo as a partisan document.\n\nA House panel voted Monday to make the memo public, a move the Justice Department has said would be \"extraordinarily reckless\" because its officials had not reviewed it.\n\nMcCabe's resignation comes as the FBI faces fallout from thousands of text messages between an FBI agent and lawyer who were involved in the Russia investigation, including some texts harshly critical of Trump. The lawyer worked for McCabe.\n\nAfter reports circulated in December that McCabe might soon leave the bureau, Trump took to Twitter to criticize him for remaining in the job. \"FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits,\" Trump wrote. \"90 days to go?!!!\"\n\nThe White House said Trump played no role in McCabe's decision to step down. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president wasn't part of the \"decision-making process\" on McCabe's departure.\n\nMcCabe, a career official at the FBI who spent nearly 20 years with the agency, was the acting FBI director after Trump fired the previous director, James Comey, in May. Days later, Mueller was appointed to probe the Russian conduct.\n\nMcCabe first worked on organized crime cases in the FBI's New York field office, then advanced to a series of leadership positions, including in counterterrorism and at the Bureau's Washington field office.\n\nBeyond McCabe, Trump has criticized, or raised questions about, a variety of figures related to the Russia investigation, from Attorney General Jeff Sessions to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to Comey, who hired McCabe as his deputy in January 2016.\n\nThose close to McCabe expected him to leave the FBI around March when he was eligible to receive his full retirement benefits after 20 years of service. Many agents in such a position choose to retire and start second, generally more lucrative, careers outside of government.\n\nMcCabe first attracted notice from Republicans in 2016 as a result of his supervisory role in the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. Republicans raised conflict-of-interest questions because his wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, ran for Virginia state senate in 2015 with financial support from the political organization of then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and longtime ally of Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe FBI has said McCabe played no role in his wife's campaign, and McAuliffe has said it is typical for governors to support candidates of the same party. McCabe received clearance from the FBI's ethics office to oversee the Clinton investigation, but Republicans have argued he should have stepped aside.",
    " Title: Mortgage-Interest Tax Deduction: A Controversial Policy in Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nThe mortgage-interest tax deduction, a long-standing policy in the United States, has come under scrutiny from some policy advisers who argue that it lacks merit from a policy perspective. This view is supported by a significant body of academic research, which suggests that the mortgage-interest tax deduction disproportionately benefits the wealthy and has minimal impact on home ownership.\n\nOne policy adviser, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of losing his job, stated, \"The mortgage-interest deduction, from a purely policy perspective, makes no sense.\" This perspective is met with resistance in Washington, D.C., where the mortgage-interest tax deduction is considered a \"sacred cow.\"\n\nJimmy Williams, a former lobbyist for the National Association of Realtors, is one of the powerful forces that have long defended the mortgage-interest tax deduction. Williams stated, \"If I were at the Realtors right now, I'd declare war on anyone who tried to get rid of the deduction.\" He would employ tactics such as running ads, encouraging Realtors across the country to make phone calls, and donating to influential legislators to deter any attempts to abolish the deduction.\n\nJamie Gregory, who currently lobbies for the Realtors, argues that eliminating the deduction would lead to a nationwide drop in home prices, potentially destabilizing the economy. Furthermore, he contends that homeowners are the primary lobby in favor of the deduction. Gregory asserts, \"For middle-class Americans, either doing away or limiting the mortgage-interest deduction is going to be a tax increase.\"\n\nWhile phasing out the deduction over time for future homebuyers is a possibility, the fear of being ridiculed for proposing such a change remains a significant barrier in Washington, D.C. The future of the mortgage-interest tax deduction remains uncertain, as smart policy staffers in D.C. navigate the complexities of this contentious issue.",
    " Title: Obama's 2012 Election Campaign and Campaign Finance Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2012 election, President Barack Obama, who has long positioned himself as a champion against the influence of big money in politics, has faced criticism from campaign finance reformers. These reformers argue that the president, despite his past rhetoric, has neglected his reformist agenda and embraced elements of a new, laissez-faire election system he previously criticized.\n\nThe president granted his approval earlier this year to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC run by two of his former staffers, to raise and spend unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, or individuals. This move has led to the president potentially becoming the first chief executive not to successfully appoint someone to the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\n\nThe White House considered, but ultimately declined, to issue an executive order restricting federal contractors that receive taxpayer dollars from \"interfering\" in elections. The administration also abandoned a full-time \"ethics czar\" position and did not respond to a plea to overhaul the FEC submitted in February by good-government types.\n\nThe president has not proposed replacing the nation's presidential public funding system, a system he effectively rendered obsolete four years ago by reneging on a promise to accept public campaign funds and then raising approximately $750 million, more than any other presidential candidate in U.S. history.\n\n\"We're seeing daily things get worse,\" said Robert Weissman, President of Public Citizen. \"And his failure of action will result in things growing even more worse.\"\n\nDavid Bossie, president of the conservative Citizens United organization, expressed satisfaction with Obama's lack of action on campaign finance issues. \"Obama hasn't been addressing these issues in any way, shape or form. It's great for us,\" Bossie said.\n\nThe Obama administration defends the president, noting he signed an executive order on his first day in office strictly limiting lobbyists' access to the administration. The White House spokesman, Eric Schultz, stated that Obama's White House has \"done more than any administration in history\" to \"reduce the impact of special interests in Washington.\"\n\nHowever, the president does not collect money from special-interest PACs or lobbyists, and about 98% of his donations come from people contributing $250 or less. The campaign also voluntarily releases information on its top fundraising bundlers.",
    " Title: Trumpism Remains Elusive 100 Days into President Trump's Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nOne hundred days into President Donald Trump's administration, the definition of 'Trumpism' remains unclear, as the President's approach to governance appears to be a blend of conventional Republican policies and his own impulses.\n\nDuring the campaign, two main theories emerged about Trumpism: economic populism combined with social conservatism and isolationism, or a lack of a coherent ideology, with Trump making decisions based on his own impulses. As of now, it remains uncertain which interpretation is more accurate.\n\nOn foreign policy, Trump is adopting a more traditional Republican stance, earning praise from the foreign-policy establishment he once criticized. However, on domestic policy, Trump is distancing himself from his populist campaign rhetoric, appointing billionaires and CEOs to his Cabinet, and signing executive orders beneficial to big banks.\n\nOne challenge President Trump faces in translating his nationalist, populist, and anti-establishment instincts into a coherent governing agenda is the lack of a significant number of Trumpist congressmen. Trumpism was more of an attitude than a well-defined movement.\n\nDespite this, Trump does have a base, primarily white, working-class voters who are closely watching his actions on trade and immigration, the issues that fueled his rise. Trump is moving forward aggressively on these issues, focusing on the same economic and cultural anxieties he stoked during the campaign.\n\nTrump's message on immigration is already being felt, with a decrease in illegal border crossings, H1B1 visa applications, applications from foreign students to American universities, and tourism to the U.S.\n\nUpcoming issues, such as tax overhaul, will test Trumpism further. Trump has vowed to announce his tax cut plan on Wednesday. Every tax bill has winners and losers, and Trump's tax bill will provide insight into the true nature of Trumpism. If the working-class voters feel they are being negatively impacted, Trump could lose support from his base.\n\nSo far, Trump's base has remained loyal to him, with his base voters expressing satisfaction with his performance. However, his approval ratings are at historic lows for a new president, and Trumpism remains a mystery. Whether Trumpism is a nativist version of a Mitt Romney administration or an evolving ideology awaiting the next impulsive decision of a flexible and unpredictable president remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Job Growth Slows as Economy Adds Only 69,000 Jobs in May\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy added only 69,000 jobs in May, marking a significant slowdown from the 275,000 jobs created in January. The Labor Department reported these figures, indicating a potential deceleration in job growth.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the ongoing recession, numerous small business owners are persisting in their efforts to expand and hire more employees. Srinivas Konanki, who owns Pipette Calibration Services with his wife, is one such entrepreneur. The company, based outside Boston, specializes in calibrating laboratory equipment, specifically precise lab tools called pipettes.\n\nA pipette resembles an oversized ballpoint pen, with a click button on top that dispenses liquid instead of ink. \"The difference here is that you are actually measuring what you're squirting,\" Konanki explains, contrasting it with a regular squirt gun. \"And so this [measures] very accurate volumes.\"\n\nKonanki's expertise lies in the workings of pipettes. His wife, Manjula Konanki, jokes that he could talk about them for hours. However, when discussing their business, the Konankis adopt a more serious tone. \"We, as a small business, have been very careful as to how we spend our money,\" Srinivas says.\n\nJob growth, according to Konanki, is heavily dependent on business confidence. To hire new workers, an entrepreneur needs to be optimistic that business will continue to improve. The economic environment, with its ongoing turbulence in Europe and potential cutbacks in U.S. government spending, has given business owners plenty of cause for caution.\n\nSrinivas is particularly concerned about the ongoing economic instability in Europe, as many European countries run research labs in the Boston area. \"When they make cuts, they make cuts all over,\" he says. \"And when that happens, we see our business cut down.\"\n\nHis other major concern is potential cutbacks in U.S. government spending, particularly potential cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH could face an 8% funding cut at the end of the year as part of what's called \"sequestration,\" if Congress fails to meet budget-cutting targets it imposed on itself through legislation last year.\n\nBetsey Stevenson, a labor economist with the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, shares Srinivas' concerns. She agrees that Europe could be a headwind on hiring in the U.S., and many other businesses are worried about Congress' decisions later this year regarding the Bush-era tax cuts, unemployment benefits, and required spending cuts.\n\nThese decisions facing Congress at year's end have been collectively dubbed the \"fiscal cliff.\" \"Congress is saying, 'We're going to make this difficult,'\" Stevenson says. \"That sends a signal to all the actors in the economy that 'there is potential for real damage to our economy coming in the future, and you should prepare for it today.'\"\n\nDespite these uncertainties, the U.S. is still managing to add new jobs each month. David Kotok, chief economist at Cumberland Advisors, a Florida-based investment advisory firm, acknowledges that job growth has slowed since the start of the year. However, he also sees reasons to be optimistic.\n\n\"The manufacturing sector is growing in the United States,\" Kotok says. As it does, he continues, it creates higher-paying jobs. The energy sector is also doing well, he says, with rapid growth in natural gas exploration promising to create many more well-paid work opportunities.\n\n\"And the third piece,\" Kotok says, \"is the gradual stabilization of housing. It's happening slowly\u2014but it's happening.\" If this trend continues, it eventually means more jobs for carpenters, electricians, and many other people who work in related industries.\n\nKotok, the chief investment officer for a firm that manages billions of dollars, has to put his money where his mouth is when it comes to reading the economic tea leaves. And he says he's placing his chips on a slow but continued recovery for the U.S. economy and for employment.",
    " Title: New York Primary: Clinton and Trump Lead in Polls, Aim for Victory to Secure Delegates\n\nArticle:\n\nThe New York primary is underway, with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump leading in the polls. The Republican front-runner, Trump, has vowed to win enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination and prevent a contested convention. However, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are not conceding defeat yet.\n\nA significant win in New York could tip the scales for both Clinton and Trump in this year's race for the White House. Both candidates have experienced losses in recent contests, shifting the momentum to their rivals. Sanders, in a recent address to supporters, stated, \"We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries!\"\n\nTrump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide to secure all of New York's 95 GOP delegates, moving him closer to avoiding a contested convention. Trump urged his supporters, \"We've got to vote and you know Cruz is way, way down in the polls.\"\n\nSanders, on the other hand, is hoping for a close race in the Empire State. A loss by 10 points would mean he'll need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination.\n\nDespite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz has not lost momentum. He is aiming to secure more delegates this weekend while emphasizing his ability to win in November. Cruz told his supporters, \"Because if I'm the nominee, we win the General Election. We're beating Hillary in the key swing states, we're beating Hillary with Independents, we're beating Hillary with young people.\"\n\nFor now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have moved on from New York to other states. Trump and Clinton are the only two remaining in their home state to watch the results come in.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Allegations Against China's Role in COVID-19 Pandemic: A Look at the Facts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration's assertion that China is responsible for the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has been a recurring theme in recent months. This claim, as expressed in various commentaries, including one by Jeffrey D. Sachs, a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, suggests that China's success is a result of cheating, rather than hard work and strategic planning.\n\nThe Trump administration and its allies have recently escalated these claims, suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic was the result of an accidental release from a Chinese laboratory and a subsequent cover-up by China. However, these allegations have been met with skepticism, as they could potentially lead the world towards conflict, much like the Bush Administration's lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq led the U.S. into war in 2003.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, for instance, asserted on Sunday, \"There is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.\" Such charges, if proven false, could be reminiscent of the end of the McCarthy era, with Trump being compared to Senator Joseph McCarthy, who used lies and innuendos to scare Americans into submission.\n\nThe right-wing claims against China are illogical and lack supporting evidence. The virus was in circulation in Wuhan for weeks before the Chinese authorities organized a major New Year's event on January 18, which spread the virus. If China knew about and was covering up a laboratory release several weeks earlier, why would they organize such an event? The actual answer is that they were still in the midst of combating the new virus.\n\nThe biology and chronology do not support the laboratory-release story. The Wuhan lab did not have the Covid-19 virus under study. The virus is of a kind that originates in bats, but Covid-19 may have had an intermediate mammal host, perhaps one that was traded in the Wuhan live animal market implicated in a majority of the cases with onset before January 1, 2020. The Wuhan market was shut down on January 1 after the initial outbreak.\n\nFurthermore, the administration and right-wing media also charge that China covered up the outbreak more generally for weeks. However, the record shows that doctors in Wuhan first noted unusual cases of viral pneumonia in mid-December. Wuhan health officials notified the World Health Organization office in China on December 31. The China health agency called the US CDC on January 3. The genome was fully sequenced and published online on January 11, and Wuhan was locked down on January 23.\n\nGiven the inevitable early confusion about a new disease that had never before been seen, that is a rapid timeline. There were mistakes, such as the delay in declaring definitively that the virus transmitted human to human, but the overall response was relatively swift.\n\nTragically, Dr. Li Wenliang, who first warned of the outbreak, was forced to sign a statement admitting to disturbing the public order and later succumbed to the disease in February. However, he was exonerated by a national investigation in March.\n\nIn conclusion, the Trump administration's allegations against China's role in the COVID-19 pandemic lack supporting evidence and could potentially lead the world towards conflict. The timeline of events shows that China acted relatively swiftly in response to the outbreak, and the laboratory-release story is not supported by biology or chronology. The U.S. should focus on cooperation and fact-finding, rather than blame and accusations, to combat the ongoing pandemic.",
    " Title: Lobbying Activities and Collusion Allegations Surface in EPA-NRDC Relationship\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, including Rep. Darrell E. Issa of California and Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana, have requested documents and emails from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding its association with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). The legislators' concern stems from allegations that the NRDC's influence on EPA policy decisions may have allowed it to achieve its own agenda.\n\nThe Energy & Environment Legal Institute, in a report of its investigation, has uncovered a trail of emails revealing a potential revolving door between senior EPA officials and radical environmentalists. One batch of messages suggests that Sierra Club lobbyists provided biased research, which eager EPA officials accepted as justification to shut down coal plants.\n\nTo avoid scrutiny and evade the agency's visitors log, outside activists and government employees reportedly met at the J.W. Marriott Hotel, located across the street from EPA headquarters, to discuss regulatory actions and the planning of EPA hearings. Government officials allegedly provided advance notice of regulatory actions, giving the groups a head start on organizing the appearance of grass-roots support.\n\nThe emails describing the EPA's alleged shady business dealings were obtained after more than a year of wrangling and court battles. Former EPA administrator Lisa P. Jackson, who used the email pseudonym \"Richard Windsor,\" was found to have concealed her participation in some emails. An example of this is an email congratulating Al Armendariz, a regional EPA administrator, on his new job at the Sierra Club.\n\nSenator Vitter suggests that the orders come from a group of left-wing foundations that pull the strings of environmentalist groups, influencing Washington. The specific activities of these foundations and their financial backers remain unclear, but the classic rent-seeking model, where opposing projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline opens the way for competing projects, is a possible explanation.\n\nThe allegations of collusion between the EPA and the NRDC are currently under investigation, and the EPA has yet to release the requested documents and emails. The full extent of the relationship between the two parties and the potential influence it may have had on EPA policy decisions remains to be determined.",
    " Title: \"Margaret Thatcher's Legacy and the Search for a New Conservative Leader\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement reported by The Times of London in 1992, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher criticized a fellow party member who supported Britain's entry into the European Union, stating, \"The trouble with you, John, is that your spine does not reach your brain.\"\n\nThatcher, known for her iron will and boundless energy, was a woman whose life was devoted to reform. Her impact on British politics and conservatism is still felt today, with American conservatives often looking to Ronald Reagan as a model.\n\nReagan, who brought conservatism into the mainstream and proved its principles electorally and practically effective, was a charismatic leader who defied the caricatures of conservatives as either radicals or indifferent to human suffering. However, it is important to note that projecting Reagan's views and actions onto contemporary issues or the modern political landscape is a futile exercise, as no politician can replicate his unique gifts and character.\n\nThe Republican Party, which has been grappling with a lack of top talent following two successive electoral defeats, is in search of new leaders who can embody the principles of conservatism and inspire the electorate. While there are rising stars within the party, the absence of a clear heir apparent and an ideological captain has led to a tumultuous political landscape.\n\nIn 1975, Thatcher took control of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom when it was in a state of disarray. The party had suffered defeats and the advancement of socialism, leaving it open to new ideas. Thatcher, a woman of middle-class origin, was not a movie star or a seasoned politician, but she fought her way to the front of the line, emphasizing ideas and the need for new ones.\n\nToday's American Republicans could benefit from a leader with Thatcher's force of will and personality. While there are many with big ideas, there seems to be a lack of individuals with Thatcher's consuming fire. It is possible that out of the current chaos on the right, a Thatcher or two may be rising, thoughtful, urgent, and eloquent individuals who defy conventional thinking about the party. If America is ready for change in 2016, one of these individuals may have the chance to do what Thatcher did and reset the trajectory of their nation.",
    " Title: Carly Fiorina's Presidential Ambitions and the Perception of Female Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nThe widespread speculation that Carly Fiorina is only running for the vice presidency has been a recurring topic among political insiders, donors, consultants, media, and grassroots activists. This notion, particularly when expressed by women who identify as feminists, has sparked debate and raised eyebrows.\n\nWhile it is acknowledged that the author, who has worked with Fiorina in the past, holds a biased perspective, the central point remains: the assumption that Fiorina is only aiming for the vice presidency is not applied to male candidates in the same manner.\n\nIn contrast to the numerous male candidates in the Republican field, Fiorina is the only one consistently taking on Hillary Clinton, the expected Democratic nominee, in a direct and sustained manner. Despite facing fewer resources and less media attention, Fiorina's focus on Clinton demonstrates her determination and potential strength as a presidential candidate.\n\nHowever, the author suggests that this focus on Fiorina may stem from several factors, including her business background, the polling data, and the historical skepticism towards female candidates in politics. As a result, Fiorina, the only female Republican woman running in 2016, may face unique challenges and perceptions that male candidates do not encounter.\n\nThe author concludes by questioning whether America is ready for a female president, given the historical rejection of high-profile female candidates in the past. Despite these challenges, Fiorina's presidential ambitions are clear, and she is running for the presidency, not the vice presidency.",
    " Title: Democrats Criticize Trump Over Iran Strike, Republicans Respond\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the White House strike on Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, a series of criticisms from Democrats have been directed towards President Trump, rather than Iran. The attack, which took place at Baghdad International Airport, has sparked debate among political parties, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi describing it as \"provocative and disproportionate.\"\n\nWhite House counsel Kellyanne Conway responded to the criticism by accusing congressional Democrats of ignoring the danger posed by Soleimani, who was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. soldiers in the Middle East. In a White House briefing, Conway stated, \"They sound like they\u2019re defending Soleimani and attacking this president, and that\u2019s on them.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also defended Trump, stating that some Democrats have \"rushed to blame our own government before even knowing the facts\" and have \"rushed to downplay Soleimani\u2019s evil while presenting our own president as the villain.\"\n\nFormer vice presidential nominee Joe Lieberman criticized his fellow Democrats for their \"uniformly skeptical or negative reactions to Soleimani\u2019s death,\" arguing that the decision deserves bipartisan support.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of putting the nation on the path for another Middle East war and have questioned the legality of the attack, insisting that he should have sought congressional authorization. House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff called for Congress to engage with hearings and constraints, blasting Trump\u2019s \"dangerous and provocative decision.\"\n\nThe leading presidential candidates have also been critical of Trump. Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted that the president was \"dangerous,\" while Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for legislation that \"reasserts Congress\u2019s constitutional authority over war.\"\n\nConservatives have criticized the coverage from mainstream media outlets as more friendly towards Soleimani than Trump. Kyle Drennen, Media Research Center senior news analyst, stated, \"Story after story is talking about how 'Soleimani was so revered, so respected, so beloved in Iran, he was a hero to them.' This is the kind of fawning coverage that this terrorist has gotten on the networks.\"\n\nIn a related development, Washington Post reporter Missy Ryan was criticized on social media for retweeting a photo comparing the crowds at Soleimani\u2019s funeral to those at Trump\u2019s 2016 inauguration. \"The media is not interested in reporting accurately or fairly on Iran and Iraq. They just want to help the Democrats beat Trump,\" said Erick Erickson of the Resurgent.",
    " Title: Biden's New York Visit Signals Potential Challenge to Clinton Among Progressive Democrats\n\nArticle:\n\nJoe Biden's visit to New York on Thursday marks a significant step in his apparent pre-campaign exploration, as he delves into the political territory once represented by Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State and New York Senator. This visit, which includes events focused on women's issues, minimum wage, and an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, is seen by many as a direct challenge to Clinton's standing among liberal Democrats.\n\nBiden's itinerary includes a discussion on rape kit backlogs, an appearance with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, whose Justice Department is currently investigating Clinton's email server use, and a joint event with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to support a $15 minimum wage for fast-food workers, a cause popular among progressives.\n\nThe vice president's office maintains that these events are official and unrelated to his potential presidential run. However, the growing consensus among political observers is that these actions are indicative of a burgeoning campaign, to the excitement of many of Clinton's former constituents.\n\nRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, expressed his support for Clinton but noted his intention to assess Biden's intentions before making an endorsement. Neal Kwatra, a New York-based consultant with deep ties to labor and progressives, highlighted Biden's long history with labor unions as a potential advantage in a city with the highest union membership in the state.\n\nWhile many high-profile New York Democrats, including Cuomo, Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, and state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, have already endorsed Clinton, the support of traditional power brokers may not carry as much weight in the dynamic world of New York politics.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is yet to endorse a candidate, is reportedly holding out hope of using his progressive seal of approval to boost his national profile. His spokesperson was unavailable for comment regarding Biden and Clinton's progressive support.\n\nGustavo Rivera, a state senator who represents the Bronx and identifies as progressive, expressed his support for Clinton but acknowledged that he, like many others, is eager for Biden to enter the race. Rivera believes that a Biden candidacy would compel Clinton to address progressive issues more thoroughly and potentially shift her political stance further to the left.\n\nClinton's campaign declined to comment on Biden's visit or her standing with New York progressives. Meanwhile, Clinton will be campaigning and fundraising in Columbus, Ohio and Milwaukee on Thursday.\n\nBiden is expected to expand on the economic fairness message he began in Pittsburgh on Monday, where he addressed a union crowd and criticized the current tax code as unfair. However, Dan Morris, a consultant for New York groups involved with the Fight for 15 and other progressive causes, expressed reservations about Biden's record on progressive issues, citing his support for a $12 federal minimum wage, his 1990s anti-crime legislation's disproportionate impact on African-Americans, and his questionable appeal to minority and female voters who would benefit most from raising the minimum wage.\n\nDespite these concerns, Morris acknowledged that a Biden campaign could benefit the Democrats by forcing Clinton to engage more deeply with progressive issues and potentially making Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) a more significant factor in the race. Morris also suggested that Biden's progressive credentials are uncertain, describing him as more of a \"question mark\" than an \"exclamation point.\"",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Criticizes Obama's Foreign Policy Strategy in Interview, Blames It for Rise of ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has criticized President Barack Obama's foreign policy strategy, stating that it contributed to the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq. In an interview with The Atlantic's national correspondent, Jeffrey Goldberg, Clinton argued that Obama's refusal to \"build up a credible fighting force\" created conditions for jihadists to gain dominance in Iraq.\n\nClinton stated, \"The failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against [Syrian leader Bashar] Assad \u2014 there were Islamists, there were secularists, there was everything in the middle \u2014 the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.\"\n\nThe comments appear to be an attempt by Clinton to distance herself from Obama in anticipation of a potential 2016 presidential bid. Clinton also criticized Obama's broader approach to foreign policy, saying, \"Great nations need organizing principles, and 'Don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle.\"\n\nThe interview marks Clinton's first major criticism of the president's foreign policy since she stepped down from the administration last year. A source close to Clinton told Business Insider that her comments were more related to the thoughts she set out in her new book, \"Hard Choices,\" and that she was \"merely commenting on world events.\"\n\nHowever, according to Politico, a source familiar with the interview said Clinton's staff gave the White House a heads-up that it had taken place.\n\nMeanwhile, hostility towards a Clinton run seems to be building from the president's quarters. Veteran journalist and New York Times best-selling author, Ed Klein, whose latest book, \"Blood Feud,\" focuses on the rift between the Obamas and the Clintons, has reported that Obama authorized senior adviser Valerie Jarrett to have secret meetings with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The aim, he said, is to encourage Warren to mount a challenge to a Clinton 2016 White House bid.",
    " Title: Governors' Stay-at-Home Orders and Religious Gatherings: A Contentious Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic has led to stay-at-home orders in nearly all U.S. states, prompting difficult decisions for lawmakers regarding which establishments should be deemed essential and remain open. One of the most contentious debates revolves around the closure of places of worship, such as churches, mosques, and synagogues.\n\nWhile more than a dozen governors have included exemptions in their orders for religious gatherings, some have imposed limitations on attendance and mandated social distancing. Some religious leaders have complied by holding small services or transitioning to online worship, but others have defied restrictions by continuing to hold regular services to large crowds.\n\nIn Florida, an evangelical Christian pastor was arrested for persisting in holding large services last week. The state's governor later issued a stay-at-home order that included an exemption for religious gatherings with no limitations on crowd size.\n\nAdvocates for closing all places of worship during the pandemic argue that public health takes precedence over First Amendment freedoms at this time. Large crowds, regardless of the gathering, should be prohibited, they say, but there is also evidence that religious gatherings can be particularly dangerous. Coronavirus clusters in several states, including Washington and California, have been traced back to religious gatherings.\n\nReligious leaders counter that physical attendance is not necessary to practice one's faith, citing online services as a high-quality alternative. Legal analysts maintain that closing places of worship does not violate freedom of religion as outlined in the First Amendment during the specific case of the pandemic.\n\nA group of faith leaders and congregants argue that religion is an essential part of their lives, and the freedom to practice as they see fit\u2014even if it poses a risk\u2014takes precedence over public health orders. Others support allowing small religious gatherings that adhere to social distancing, rather than complete bans. Places of worship serve an important role beyond religious services in many communities, some argue, and could provide critical support for people with health or economic needs if permitted to safely remain open.\n\nConcerns have been raised that orders that force religious institutions to close completely may backfire, creating an adversarial relationship between religion and government that stokes fears of persecution.\n\n\"When our diocese and our church made the difficult decision to close our church building, we began living into a truth we have long proclaimed: the church is not a building. It is a community of people,\" said Rev. Leslie Hague of the South Florida Sun Sentinel.\n\n\"In this time of chaos, uncertainty, and gloom, faith and religious gatherings can provide peace, purpose, and fellowship. However, it is for these reasons that church, and religious gatherings in general, are among the highest risk venues, as otherwise isolated older adults come into close contact with socially active younger adults and children who may carry the coronavirus asymptomatically,\" wrote Eugenia C.

    " Title: George Soros's Role in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Political Career\n\nArticle:\n\nNew details have emerged suggesting that financier George Soros played a role in the political career of Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. According to reports, Soros, through his funding of a network of far-left publications, provided support to Ocasio-Cortez's campaign, which aided her victory in the Democratic primary.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a former organizer for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, was able to defeat her heavily-funded opponent, Joseph Crowley, in the primary on June 26, 2018. This victory was attributed to her strong online presence, which was bolstered by coverage from media outlets linked to Soros-funded digital media.\n\nIn an interview with progressive digital media outlet \"The Young Turks,\" a member of a Soros-funded network of far-left publications, Ocasio-Cortez admitted that their coverage had helped her win. Cenk Uygur, a member of the Soros-funded media and founder of one of the political groups that asked Ocasio-Cortez to run, Justice Democrats, was eventually forced out of the organization due to past sexist comments.\n\nJustice Democrats, along with another organization, Brand New Congress, aims to elect socialist politicians to Congress. Ocasio-Cortez's website, Ocasio2018.com, was first registered in May 2017 and redirected to her page on BrandNewCongress.Org, according to an Internet archive captured in June 2017.\n\nIn a June 2017 interview with Uygur on his YouTube channel \"The Young Turks,\" Ocasio-Cortez thanked Uygur and other media platforms for covering her before the primaries, stating that their support \"in no small part\" helped her win. Ocasio-Cortez also acknowledged that Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress had asked her to run for office in the first place.\n\nThe Media Consortium, a network of far-left media publications that includes Mother Jones, Democracy Now!, and dozens of other outlets, is a part of Soros's media empire, reaching nearly 300 million people a month, according to the Media Research Center (MRC). The MRC report suggests that Soros funds nearly every major left-wing media source in the United States, with 45 of those being financed through his support of the Media Consortium. The report also details the progressive echo chamber Soros intentionally created with the Media Consortium with the intention of shaping public opinion.",
    " Title: Obama Appoints Ron Klain as Ebola Response Coordinator\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has appointed Ron Klain as the Ebola Response Coordinator, according to knowledgeable sources, following his announcement on Thursday that he would consider having one individual to coordinate the federal response to any potential Ebola outbreak in the United States.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest stated that Klain's role will be an \"important, high-level implementation role\" and that it will be his responsibility to ensure that all government agencies responsible for aspects of the response coordinate their efforts effectively. He will also play a role in making decisions related to the response.\n\nThe administration has faced criticism for its response to Ebola incidents in the United States, particularly in terms of hospital preparedness for potential Ebola patients and the preparedness of healthcare workers regarding personal protective gear. Some lawmakers have called for a travel ban on individuals coming from West Africa, where the outbreak is most severe, but the administration has not yet endorsed this idea.\n\nKlain is highly regarded at the White House for his management skills and relationships both within the administration and on Capitol Hill. He has no extensive background in healthcare, but the job is viewed as a managerial challenge rather than a healthcare one.\n\nKlain will report to White House homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco and National Security Adviser Susan Rice, according to a White House official. A former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden and then-Vice President Al Gore, Klain is currently president of Case Holdings and general counsel of Revolution, an investment group.\n\nSome Republicans have criticized the appointment, citing Klain's lack of a healthcare background as a disqualifier. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce stated that Obama should have chosen someone with medical experience, while Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida expressed concerns about the president's choice.\n\nThe term \"Ebola czar\" is not officially endorsed by the White House, with press secretary Josh Earnest stating, \"As far as I'm concerned, you can call him anything you want. We call him the Ebola Response Coordinator.\"",
    " Title: Illinois Governor Rauner's Executive Order Aims to Reduce Business Regulations and Occupational Licensing\n\nArticle:\n\nIllinois Governor Bruce Rauner, in an attempt to attract businesses and stimulate job growth, has issued Executive Order 16-13, which aims to reduce business regulations and administrative burdens by 25% over the next two years. The order, effective as of October 17, 2015, seeks to save the state at least $250 million in government fees.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the order provides seven guidelines, including ensuring regulations are up-to-date, understandable, consistent, necessary, and not unduly burdensome. Each state agency must review its administrative rules to ensure they adhere to these guidelines, with regulations that fail to meet the new standards subject to repeal or reform.\n\nThe Illinois Competitiveness Council, chaired by U-Jung Choe and comprising representatives from the governor's office and several regulatory agencies, will oversee these efforts. One of the council's focuses will be the reform of occupational licensing, a practice that requires individuals to obtain government permission to work in certain professions.\n\nOccupational licensing has been criticized for imposing significant time and financial burdens that act as disincentives to work. According to the Institute for Justice's comprehensive report on state licensing, Illinois ranked 30th in terms of overall requirements and burdens. Out of the 102 low- and middle-income occupations evaluated in IJ's report, 40 required a license in Illinois.\n\nThe number of licenses issued by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulations has increased 184% over the last 20 years. This follows a national upward trend in licensing that has occurred since the 1950s. University of Minnesota economist Morris Kleiner estimates that 25% of Illinois workers now require government permission to work, compared to Indiana, which licenses only 15% of its overall workforce.\n\nMany Illinois licenses do little to ensure public safety, as demonstrated by less-burdensome standards in other states. For example, Illinois is one of few states that licenses pharmacy technicians, mandating two years of training, while 39 states do not license the occupation at all. Similarly, California requires only 365 days of training and no tests to become a preschool teacher, compared to Illinois' five times more training (1,825 days) and three more tests to teach young children.\n\nIllinois makes cosmetologists complete 350 days of education and training, while Emergency Medical Technicians need to complete only 26 days of training. The correlation between safety risks and licensing burdens is often tenuous, with cutting, styling, and dying hair warranting some level of government-approved competency but posing less of a safety risk than an occupation that literally requires professionals to hold lives in their hands.\n\nGovernor Rauner's program created a Red Tape Reduction Portal, allowing Illinoisans to flag state regulations that hinder their businesses. The goal is to restore sanity to licensing by ensuring government intervention only when necessary. The current licensing system in Illinois creates substantial time and financial barriers to work that often do little or nothing to ensure public safety.\n\nWhile reducing regulation is never easy, there is reason to be optimistic about Illinois' reform efforts. Other states, such as Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and Wisconsin, have recently reformed their business regulations. The most significant takeaway from Executive Order 16-13 is that governors can single-handedly follow through on their promises to open more work opportunities, even if state legislatures refuse to make necessary reforms.",
    " Title: Lame-Duck Session in December Expected to be Minimal, Focused on Government Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nDecember's lame-duck session in the U.S. Congress is expected to be the least productive in a long time, with Senate Democrats and House Republicans privately stating that the post-election work period will be uneventful. Unlike the past two lame-duck sessions, which resulted in major fiscal deals, this year's session is likely to focus solely on renewing government funding at the beginning of the month.\n\nSignificant issues such as immigration, tax, or entitlement reform are not expected to be addressed during the lame-duck session. Both parties are not pretending a big legislative push is in the offing. The most recent attempt to ensure a productive lame-duck session came Tuesday when House Republicans announced they will extend the Export-Import Bank's charter until 2015, avoiding a December fight over the controversial issue.\n\nThe lack of legislative activity during the lame-duck session is attributed to the uncertainty about the power structure in the next Congress. If Republicans take the Senate, they are unlikely to cooperate in December. If Democrats maintain control of the chamber, the political gridlock will remain frozen. The only deadline is at the beginning of the month. The incentives are not in place to make December big and bold.\n\nIntricate political calculations are being made behind the scenes. For example, House Republicans are being careful not to place any legislative fights in the opening months of 2015, as they don't want Republicans to have a rocky start if they capture the Senate majority. There isn't much talk about the post-election period in closed House Republican Conference strategy sessions.\n\nHouse Republicans, who know they will remain in power come January, are so bullish on their party controlling the Senate that most of their internal planning is predicated on Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) becoming the majority leader in January. There have even been private conversations about a closed-door Senate-House policy retreat to develop an agenda if the party grabs control from Harry Reid (D-Nev.). They are privately fretting that Reid will push through a number of nominations if he loses the Senate.\n\nThe lame-duck plans, or lack thereof, were laid out by several top-level sources in both parties, and preview a December very different than in 2012 and 2010. In 2010, after Republicans took control of the House, President Barack Obama and congressional leaders cut a deal to extend the Bush-era tax rates for all Americans. In 2012, shortly after Mitt Romney and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) lost the presidency, Congress narrowly averted the so-called fiscal cliff of steep tax increases and a government shutdown. Republicans agreed to raise taxes on wealthy Americans just before midnight on New Year's Eve.\n\nThis year, there's one main item to take care of in December: averting another government shutdown. The government-funding bill, which the House is likely to pass this week, will run until Dec. 11. Congress will return to D.C. at some point in late November\u2014the House will hold its leadership elections then. Senior aides see two options to extend government funding: Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) and Senate Appropriations Chairman Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) want to begin crafting a long-term omnibus spending bill, but some in GOP leadership think it's more likely Congress will pass another stop-gap spending measure.\n\nHouse Republicans are eager to avoid another fiscal cliff scenario\u2014piling a number of deadlines close to each other. The debt ceiling must be raised some time in March, April, or May 2015, and the GOP wants to try to avoid placing the government-funding deadline in that range.\n\nThere are a few wild cards, however. A prolonged military conflict could force Congress to pass a supplemental spending bill. Several targeted tax provisions\u2014known on Capitol Hill as \"extenders\"\u2014need to be renewed. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act expires at year's end\u2014and Republicans want to squeeze that through. And there's fear that if Obama takes any executive action on immigration, they will use the post-election period to try to cut off the White House's authority.",
    " Title: Obama Administration's Appointment of Women in Senior Roles\n\nArticle:\n\nCriticism arose earlier this year regarding the appointment of women in key positions within the Obama administration, following the departures of prominent figures such as Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former Secretary of State, and Hilda L. Solis, the former Labor Secretary. Notably, positions at the Departments of State, Defense, and the Treasury, which some liberals had anticipated would be filled by female candidates, were instead filled by male appointees.\n\nIn response to the criticism, President Obama stated at a January news conference during his second term, \"I would just suggest that everybody kind of wait until they've seen all my appointments, who is in the White House staff and who is in my cabinet, before they rush to judgment. Until you've seen what my overall team looks like, it's premature to assume that somehow we're going backwards. We're not going backwards, we're going forward.\"\n\nSince those remarks, President Obama has appointed several women to top posts, including for Interior Secretary, Commerce Secretary, Budget Director, and Director of the Environmental Protection Agency. However, according to some administration officials, this imbalance has been a point of contention within the building, leading the White House to prioritize considering female candidates earlier this year.\n\nAs of June 2012, 43 percent of President Obama's appointees had been women, according to a New York Times analysis of federal employment data. This proportion is comparable to that of the Clinton administration and represents an increase from the roughly one-third appointed by George W. Bush.\n\nThe largest gains in the number of women in the executive branch occurred during the Clinton administration. In no administration before his did women hold more than 18 percent of cabinet-level jobs; in his second term, the share exceeded 40 percent. At that level, women held a substantially larger share of senior roles in the executive branch than they did in Congress or in corporate America. During President Clinton's presidency, no more than nine women were ever serving in the Senate, whereas 20 do today.\n\nThe share of women holding board seats on Fortune 500 companies has also risen over the last two decades, to 16.6 percent last year from 9.6 percent in 1995, according to Catalyst. The executive branch continues to have a larger share of women in senior roles than Congress or corporate America, but it has also changed less since the 1990s.",
    " Title: President Trump Retweets Controversial Images Amidst Charlottesville Fallout\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump started Tuesday morning by retweeting a series of controversial images and sources, ranging from a known conspiracy theorist to an image depicting violence against the media. The retweet storm came as critics questioned the timing of Trump's scripted statement denouncing white supremacists for their role in the violence in Charlottesville, which was issued 48 hours after his initial remarks chiding \"many sides\" were criticized as inadequate.\n\nOne of the retweets was from Jack Posobiec, an alt-right figure who has pushed the Pizzagate and Seth Rich conspiracy theories. Posobiec's tweet questioned why there was no similar outrage over the violence in Chicago, stating, \"Meanwhile: 39 shootings in Chicago this weekend, 9 deaths. No national media outrage. Why is that?\" The retweet remained on the president's account as of Tuesday morning.\n\nAnother retweet shared an image of a person holding a CNN sign being hit by a train, with the commentary, \"Nothing can stop the # TrumpTrain!!\" The picture was an altered version of an IndyStar editorial cartoon, which depicted a Democratic donkey trying to hold back the Trump train. The altered image was reminiscent of another controversial tweet, when the president posted a gif that depicted him body-slamming and punching CNN.\n\nThe retweet's timing was criticized by many social media users as in poor taste, just days after a 20-year-old alleged white nationalist drove a car into a crowd of people protesting the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville \u2013 killing one and wounding 19 others in an incident Attorney General Jeff Sessions said appeared to fit the legal definition of domestic terrorism.\n\nThe retweet of the violent image was deleted Tuesday morning, though it's unclear why. The president has deleted tweets and retweets in the past.\n\nIn addition to the controversial retweets, Walter Shaub, the former head of the Office of Government Ethics, called on Congress to condemn the president given the recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump also retweeted Mike Holden, who called the president a \"fascist\" in response to news that the president was \"seriously considering\" a pardon for former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt related to a racial profiling case \u2013 a controversial move in the immediate aftermath of Charlottesville.\n\nTrump deleted his retweet of the accusation of fascism on Tuesday morning, but Holden's Twitter bio reads, \"Officially Endorsed by the President of the United States. I wish that were a good thing.\"",
    " Title: Marine Corps Delays Implementation of Pullup Test for Female Recruits\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Marine Corps has postponed the implementation of a new physical standard for female recruits, requiring them to perform three pullups, until next year. The decision was announced quietly through social media posts and an item on the Corps' own TV show, The Corps Report.\n\nAccording to Lance Cpl. Ally Beiswanger, the delay is to gather more data and ensure all female Marines are given the best opportunity to succeed. The move comes as only 45% of female recruits tested at the end of boot camp were able to perform three pullups, while 99% of male recruits passed the test.\n\nThe three pullups is already the minimum requirement for all male Marines. The Corps states that upper body strength, demonstrated by the pullup test, is necessary for ground combat duties, such as pulling oneself out of a canal, climbing over mud walls, and carrying ammunition.\n\nFor years, female Marines have had to meet a different standard, an exercise called the \"flexed arm hang.\" However, beginning in 2016, women in the Marine Corps and Army will be allowed to serve in infantry, armor, and artillery units.\n\nRobert Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, suggests that the delay indicates women are unable to meet the same standards. \"Young women, in spite of all the training and all the best intentions, are not going to be the equal of young men in terms of upper body strength,\" Maginnis says. \"You've got to have a lot of upper body strength to lift the stuff. Been there, done that.\"\n\nGreg Jacob, a former Marine and advocate for military women, argues that women can build the strength they need for pullups. He has observed female Marines reaching the same standard as their male counterparts through consistent training.\n\nThe Marine Corps must do a better job of training women to reach the same standard as men, according to Jacob. A small number of female Marines have already demonstrated their ability to pass advanced combat training, including the pullup requirement.\n\nSome Marine officers privately express concern that only a handful of female Marines will show interest in combat or be able to pass the course. Meanwhile, Lance Cpl. Ally Beiswanger, a Corps Report anchor, is working to improve her own pullup performance, aiming to complete 12 pullups. The larger goal of women in ground combat remains two years away.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Clarifies Scope of Speedy Trial Clause in Criminal Proceedings\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the \"speedy\" part of the Sixth Amendment's \"right to a speedy and public trial\" no longer applies once a defendant has been found guilty or pleads guilty to a crime. This decision was made in the case of Betterman v. Montana, where the Court upheld a Montana state court's ruling that sentencing is not part of the \"speedy trial\" period.\n\nThe case involved Brandon Thomas Betterman, who was sentenced to seven years in prison 14 months after pleading guilty to felony bail jumping in a Montana state court. The Court's opinion, delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, stated that the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause protects the accused from arrest or indictment through trial but does not apply once a defendant has been found guilty at trial or has pleaded guilty to criminal charges.\n\nCriminal proceedings consist of three parts: an investigation prior to arrest, a charge and trial where the accused is assumed innocent until proven guilty, and finally, after a conviction, a sentencing. The Court's opinion noted that the language in all three of these stages - \"accused,\" \"convicted,\" \"trial,\" and \"sentencing\" - have distinctly separate protections. The Court's opinion further clarified that the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause applies only to the second period, from arrest or indictment through conviction.\n\nThe Court's decision means that the Sixth Amendment does not protect the accused during sentencing, but the Constitution may have other protections. The opinion noted that the Court may have not considered due process clause challenges in this case, leaving open the question of whether the Fifth and 14th Amendments might provide other protections during the sentencing phase.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, in a concurring opinion, emphasized that the question of inordinately long sentencing times is an open one, and that Betterman's argument was valid but based on the wrong constitutional provision.",
    " Title: Facebook CEO Zuckerberg Criticizes Twitter's Fact-Checking Policy, Rejects Role as \"Arbiter of Truth\"\n\nArticle:\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has criticized Twitter for attaching fact-check notices to President Trump's tweets, stating that privately-owned digital platforms should not act as the \"arbiter of truth.\" In an interview with Fox News' Dana Perino, scheduled to air in full on Thursday, Zuckerberg expressed his disagreement with Twitter's policy.\n\n\"We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I just believe strongly that Facebook should not be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\" He added, \"Private companies probably should not be, especially these platform companies, should not be in the position of doing that.\"\n\nZuckerberg's comments come after President Trump warned social media giants that the federal government could \"strongly regulate\" or \"close them down\" if they continue to \"silence conservative voices.\" In response, Zuckerberg stated, \"I have to understand what they actually would intend to do. But in general, I think a government choosing to censor a platform because they're worried about censorship does not exactly strike me as the right reflex there.\"\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey responded late Wednesday, stating, \"We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make.\" Dorsey further clarified, \"This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.' Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Twitter slapped a fact-check notification on one of Trump's tweets for the first time, cautioning users that despite the president's claims about mail-in voting, \"fact checkers\" say there is \"no evidence\" that mail-in voting would increase fraud risks and that \"experts say mail-in ballots are very rarely linked to voter fraud.\"\n\nFacebook has faced criticism in the past for failing to address controversial content on the platform, but it appears Zuckerberg has no plans to change the company's policy. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg expressed a similar sentiment during a 2017 CNBC interview, asserting that the tech giant does not intend \"to be the publisher and we definitely don't want to be the arbiter of the truth.\"\n\n\"We don't think that's appropriate for us,\" Sandberg said at the time.",

Kerry warned that without a concerted effort by the international community, Ebola could become a long-term global health issue like HIV or polio.\n\nAddressing a room of foreign ambassadors, Kerry emphasized the need for stronger commitments to combat the Ebola outbreak, which has been ongoing in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia for weeks and has spread to the United States and Europe.\n\n\"There is no country that is exempt from being able to do something to contribute to this effort and help make a difference,\" Kerry said. \"And everything we do depends on how we coordinate our efforts as partners in how we contribute together.\"\n\nKerry praised a few countries for their contributions to the effort, including Cuba, a country that is historically a foe of the U.S. and often criticized by the State Department. Cuba, a country with a population of 11 million, has sent 165 health professionals, and plans to send nearly 300 more, Kerry noted.\n\nThe United Nations has called for $1 billion in funding for the Ebola response effort over the next six months. So far, only about a third of this need has been met, Kerry said.\n\n\"We live in a world of a lot of close calls, tough decisions on a daily basis -- difficult and contentious issues where you can have an honest disagreement about what the best course of action is, or about what the facts are, or the results of your decision may be,\" Kerry conceded. \"Ebola is not one of them.\"\n\nAs of now, more than 4,000 people have died from the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.

The conversation took place as United States President Barack Obama was concluding his visit to Israel.\n\nThe reconciliation occurred following Netanyahu's apology for the loss of life in the 2010 Mavi Marmara incident, in which nine Turkish activists were killed. The incident occurred when the Turkish-led flotilla, aiming to break Israel's blockade of Gaza, was intercepted by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).\n\nThe apology marked a break in a three-year deadlock, with both leaders agreeing to complete the agreement for compensation. According to a statement, Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed regret for any errors that may have led to the loss of life.\n\nErdogan's office reported that he accepted the apology and acknowledged the centuries-long strong friendship and cooperation between the Turkish and Jewish nations. The United Nations' report on the 2010 flotilla raid, which primarily sided with Israel, is noteworthy in this context.\n\nThe significance of this reconciliation may indicate growing concern among Syria's neighbors about potential spillover from the ongoing Syrian conflict. The exact cause of this concern remains unclear, but it may be related to recent claims of chemical weapons usage or other forms of escalation yet to be reported globally.\n\nThis development could potentially have implications for Iran, as it prefers its enemies in Tel Aviv and its enemies among anti-Assad Islamists to remain divided. The exact impact of this normalization of relations on the broader Middle Eastern political landscape remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Federal Judge in Maryland Blocks Revised Travel Ban, Citing Religious Discrimination\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal judge in Maryland has issued an injunction against President Trump's revised travel ban, citing religious discrimination. The ruling by Judge Theodore D. Chuang, an Obama appointee, came hours after a similar injunction was issued by another Obama-appointed judge in Hawaii.\n\nBoth judges have determined that the administration's attempt to restrict admission of visitors and would-be immigrants from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen is likely illegal. However, they have allowed restrictions to go into effect for North Korea and Venezuela, two non-Muslim countries.\n\nJudge Chuang, like his Hawaii counterpart, had previously ruled that earlier versions of the travel ban were illegal. In his 91-page ruling, he stated that the current list of eight countries subject to severe restrictions is similar to the previous list of six, suggesting little has changed. The earlier ban applied to Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The new list, which was developed after months of study by the Homeland Security and State departments of nearly 200 countries' level of cooperation in information-sharing, drops Sudan and adds Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela.\n\nAdministration officials are already working on their appeal of the Hawaii ruling. The Supreme Court had been scheduled to hear arguments on the earlier version of the travel ban last week, but after Trump's revisions in September, they called off the hearing, stating that the lower courts needed to evaluate the new policy.\n\nWhile Tuesday's ruling affects the country-specific travel ban, another part of the original executive order\u2014a 120-day pause on refugee admissions\u2014remains mostly in effect, with some court-ordered exceptions. The 120-day period expires at the end of this month, and analysts are waiting to see whether Trump tries to extend the pause. He has already reduced the overall refugee target from 110,000 people in 2017 to 45,000 in 2018.",

Since then, Merida-Galicia has been trying to learn her daughter's whereabouts, according to her attorney, Michael Avenatti.\n\nIn a note to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Merida-Galicia asked for a phone number to communicate with her daughter. An ICE officer replied, stating they did not have this information.\n\nMerida-Galicia is one of many incarcerated immigrant mothers whose attorneys tell similar stories about chaotic situations in which the mothers don't know where their children have been taken or how to contact them. The mothers themselves could not be contacted due to difficulties in accessing detained immigrants.\n\nPresident Donald Trump reversed course on Wednesday, abandoning his policy of separating children from parents who are apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. However, the fate of the more than 2,300 children already separated from their parents while Trump's policy was still in force remains unknown.\n\nAvenatti, who has made headlines representing porn star Stormy Daniels in an unrelated lawsuit against Trump, said Merida-Galicia is among more than 60 immigrant parents he represents, and 80 percent of them do not know where their children are.\n\nThe federal government and Congress are scrambling to address the many unanswered questions raised by the hastily drafted executive order Trump issued on Wednesday.\n\nAttorney Luis Cortes Romero in Kent, Washington, represents a Salvadoran woman who was separated in early May from her 11-year-old daughter with Down syndrome after the two crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas. The woman is being held in Washington state and has decided she doesn't want to pursue asylum so that she can be deported and reunited with her daughter.\n\nTrump suggested on Friday that some of the wrenching tales that have emerged from the border were fabricated by Democrats.\n\n\"We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump urged Republican lawmakers on Friday to drop their efforts to pass comprehensive immigration legislation until after the November congressional elections, flip-flopping on his appeal earlier in the week for Congress to act soon.\n\nTrump has gone back and forth on ways to solve the country's immigration problems, which he blames on Democrats.\n\n\"Elect more Republicans in November and we will pass the finest, fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world,\" Trump said on Twitter.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an \"Angel Families\" meeting with victims of illegal immigration at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 22, 2018.

Democrats are hoping that discontent among voters with Trump's policies, including on immigration, will help the party make gains in Congress and flip control to Democrats in at least one chamber.\n\nThe House of Representatives on Thursday rejected a bill backed by conservatives that would have halted the practice of splitting up families and addressed other immigration issues. The House postponed until next week a vote on a more moderate bill after it failed to attract enough support for passage. But Trump's latest tweets could doom that effort.\n\n\"Game over,\" said Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican critic of Trump who came under withering attack from the president before losing his primary race this month.\n\n\"Without the president having legislators' backs, there's no way they're going to take the risks that would be inherent in a major reform bill,\" Sanford told CNN.\n\nRepresentative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican who represents a majority Hispanic district in Florida and is not running for re-election, said Trump's tweets amounted to \"schizoid policy making.\"\n\nEven though the president has now ordered that families be kept together in detention during immigration proceedings, it remains unclear how and when those children already separated will be reunited with their parents, and where families will be held while the parents face criminal charges.\n\nThe U.S. Navy is drafting plans to house up to 25,000 immigrants on its bases and other facilities, at an estimated cost to taxpayers of about $233 million over six months, a U.S. official said on Friday. However, the Navy has not so far been asked to provide accommodation for migrants who have entered the United States illegally, and the official, who asked not to be named, stressed that the draft memo, which looks at setting up housing on Navy airfields in Alabama, was for planning purposes only.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security on Friday filed a notice saying it may need up to 15,000 more beds to handle immigrant families. That would be a sharp increase from the 2,500 beds available for families in the last fiscal year.\n\nShares in private prison operators CoreCivic Inc and Geo Group rose on Friday as investors bet on increasing demand for their services after U.S. authorities asked about available capacity for the detention of immigrant families.\n\nIt was also unclear if the government would keep prosecuting cases against people caught crossing the border illegally. It was the administration's policy of zero tolerance - announced in April - that led to blanket prosecutions, including of adults traveling with children.",
    " Title: U.S. President Donald Trump Faces Challenges Amidst Coronavirus Outbreak and Economic Downturn\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is facing one of the gravest challenges of his political career as the coronavirus pandemic spreads, leaving fellow Republicans concerned that the White House's response and the impact on the economy could harm his re-election prospects.\n\nU.S. stock market indexes, which Trump has touted throughout his term as evidence of his success, plunged into bear market territory on Thursday, a day after he tried to calm Americans' fears with an Oval Office address that promised economic stimulus and a 30-day travel ban for Europeans.\n\nSome Republicans expressed concern that the measures were too little, too late for an administration that for several weeks minimized the risk of the COVID-19 respiratory disease caused by the virus that has killed at least 39 Americans.\n\n\"The president's early downplaying and politicizing of the virus hurt his credibility and will make people question the administration's readiness from now until the day this passes,\" said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who ran Chris Christie's gubernatorial campaigns in New Jersey.\n\n\"The president's greatest strength has been the economy. If the stock markets continue to tank, and real people begin to hurt financially, it will hurt the president politically,\" DuHaime added.\n\nTrump emerged triumphant last month after his Senate acquittal in a Democratic-led impeachment drive, ready to ride high on a strong economy as a crowded field of Democratic candidates bickered over who was best to take him on in November's general election.\n\nThe narrative quickly changed. Moderate Democrats in the past two weeks have consolidated their support behind former Vice President Joe Biden over liberal Senator Bernie Sanders. They are betting that Biden can draw support from across the party, as well as from suburban moderates and disaffected Republicans.\n\nBiden seized the chance to offer a contrast to voters with his own coronavirus speech on Thursday. He lambasted the administration's handling of the crisis while seeking to portray himself as a steady, experienced hand in the face of a public health emergency.\n\n\"I'd rather be Joe Biden than Trump right now,\" said a Republican official close to the White House. \"A month ago, Trump is looking at Bernie Sanders and a strong economy and rising favorability after impeachment. Coronavirus can not have a positive impact.\"\n\nTrump's re-election campaign defended the president's actions and, in a statement, accused Biden of trying to \"capitalize politically and stoke citizens' fears.\"\n\nThe growing threat from the coronavirus forced Trump on Thursday to reverse course and suspend his large campaign rallies.\n\n\"The safety, security, and health of the American People is President Trump's top priority right now,\" the Trump campaign said in a text.\n\nNoting that Trump had called the disease a \"foreign virus,\" Biden warned against \"xenophobia\" and said the coronavirus \"does not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or ZIP code.\"\n\nBiden laid out his own plan for dealing with the outbreak, including emergency paid sick leave for workers and widely available free testing for the virus, saying the number of tests should number in the \"millions, not the thousands.\" The Trump administration has been criticized for failing to produce enough tests to meet demand.\n\n\"This virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,\" the former vice president said in his 20-minute address from his home state of Delaware. \"Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president fueled by an adversarial relationship with the truth.\"\n\nSanders, who has vowed to remain in the race despite lengthening odds, also bashed Trump's handling of the crisis. He called for stronger action by government agencies to halt the spread of the virus and for measures such as paid sick leave and unemployment compensation for those affected.\n\n\"During a crisis, we must make sure that we care for the communities most vulnerable to health and economic pain,\" Sanders told reporters in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont.\n\nA Trump supporter and fundraiser said the coronavirus outbreak had been politicized, like every issue in the United States.\n\n\"The battle lines are drawn,\" said Jim Worthington, a health club executive in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. \"If you like Trump, you think he's done all the things right, like cutting off travel to China. If you're a Democrat, you think the opposite.\"\n\n\"I think he's been ahead of the issue, and the media has really overhyped it,\" Worthington said, adding that he thought the virus should be taken seriously.\n\nThe crisis has reshaped the contours of the presidential campaign. Democratic officials announced on Thursday that Sunday's televised debate between Biden and Sanders would be moved to Washington from Arizona.\n\nOfficials had already decided not to allow an audience into the debate hall, citing contagion concerns.\n\nBiden, Sanders, and Trump have all canceled campaign events in recent days after warnings from public health officials about holding large-scale gatherings. Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Ohio hold Democratic nominating contests on Tuesday.\n\nBiden's campaign on Wednesday converted planned rallies in Florida and Illinois into \"virtual\" events and on Thursday said all staffers would begin to work from home beginning Saturday. Sanders' staffers will also work from home, reaching out to voters online instead of holding large events or door-to-door canvasses, his campaign said Thursday.\n\nLate Thursday, Trump's campaign said its events would also all be conducted in a virtual setting, including moving training sessions online.\n\nOne Republican strategist said Trump's handling of the coronavirus was hurting him now but that it was too soon to gauge its impact on his long-term political prospects. Ipsos polling from March 9-10 showed 55% of Americans disapproved of Trump, while 40% approved, largely unchanged from the past year.\n\n\"A few weeks ago, the president's supporters were very dismissive of the virus. Today, they are being very silent,\" the Republican political operative said. \"It's a supply chain issue, and he's the supply chain president. When he says we have test kits on the ground and we don't, that's a real problem.\"",
    " Title: Ten Perspectives on President Trump's Alleged Use of Offensive Language Toward Haiti and African Countries\n\nArticle:\n\n1. The use of derogatory language by President Donald Trump is a recurring theme in his public statements, a trait that serves as both a strength and a weakness. Columnist John T. Bennett argues that Trump's straightforwardness, though often politically incorrect, is a desirable quality, but regrets that it is not expressed in a more sophisticated manner.\n\n2. The use of derogatory terms such as \"s--thole\" to describe countries is inappropriate for a U.S. president, according to Bennett. He suggests that if Trump had used terms like \"dysfunctional\" instead, it might have been a service to the people of these countries, as it would have acknowledged the corruption that is a significant problem in many African and Central American countries.\n\n3. The connection between the moral state of an immigrant's country and their contribution to America is a contentious issue. Data from the Center for Immigration Studies indicates that 73% of households headed by Central American and Mexican immigrants use one or more welfare programs, compared to 32% of East Asian and 26% of European immigrants.\n\n4. The labeling of President Trump as a racist, white supremacist, fascist, and anti-Semite by the media is a \"Big Lie,\" according to Bennett. The most often provided \"evidence\" for Trump's racism is his alleged comments about the Charlottesville, Virginia, demonstrations, which the media misrepresents as him referring to neo-Nazis as \"fine people.\"\n\n5. The repeated descriptions of America as \"systemically racist\" by the left are not morally equivalent to the use of offensive language, according to Bennett. These descriptions are at least as offensive, less true, and not made in private or semi-private conversations but in the open, such as in college classes.\n\n6. The validity of describing any countries as \"s--tholes\" is questioned by some, with columnist Ben Shapiro arguing that the argument against Trump's use of the term comes down to nicety, not truth.\n\n7. Trump's openness to discussing issues with Democrats, despite their opposition to his presidency, is seen as a testament to his self-confidence and naivety.\n\n8. Private speech, according to Bennett, should not be a concern or business of the public. He defends Hillary Clinton and former President Harry Truman against charges of anti-Semitism for allegedly making derogatory comments in private.\n\n9. The Washington Post reports that President Trump also expressed a willingness to accept more immigrants from Asian countries, which could be interpreted as a counterargument to the racism charge.\n\n10. The left's use of the term \"racist\" has lost credibility, according to Bennett. The University of California lists statements like \"There is only one race, the human race\" as a \"microaggression,\" and the left labels anyone who opposes race-based quotas, all-black college dorms, or the Black Lives Matter movement as \"racist.\" The left's use of the term \"racist\" has been overused, making it difficult to believe when real instances of racism occur.",
    " Title: Trump Appoints Richard Grenell as Acting Director of National Intelligence\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced via a tweet that Richard Grenell, the current U.S. ambassador to Germany, will serve as the acting director of national intelligence (DNI). The role, which was vacated by Dan Coats in August 2019, is a position of significant responsibility, overseeing and integrating the U.S. intelligence community and advising the president and the National Security Council on intelligence matters concerning national security.\n\nGrenell, a staunch supporter of Trump, has been vocal about his deep-seated suspicion and antipathy towards the intelligence community, which he has referred to as \"Deep State\" operatives who \"hate Trump.\" In Grenell, Trump will have an unwavering loyalist overseeing the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. Prior to his ambassadorship, Grenell spent much of the previous two decades as a political adviser to Republicans, as the longest-serving U.S. spokesperson to the United Nations, and as the founder of Capitol Media Partners\u2014a media and public affairs consultancy. Grenell has never worked for an intelligence agency.\n\nGrenell will also be the first openly gay Cabinet secretary. Before his confirmation as ambassador to Germany, Grenell spent much of the previous two decades as a political adviser to Republicans, as the longest-serving U.S. spokesperson to the United Nations, and as the founder of Capitol Media Partners\u2014a media and public affairs consultancy. Grenell has never worked for an intelligence agency.\n\nAs ambassador to Germany, Grenell has been vocal in pursuing Trump's agenda, earning high praise from Trump and impassioned complaints from some German politicians. Grenell has already been Senate-confirmed as ambassador to Germany. It's not yet clear whether Trump will ultimately nominate him for the permanent DNI position, which would require another Senate confirmation. Trump has expressed a preference for \"acting\" positions, citing the flexibility they provide.\n\nIn his role as ambassador, Grenell has pressured German companies to cut business with Iran, urged Germany to increase its NATO contributions, and warned the Germans against participating in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline with Russia. On Sunday, Grenell tweeted, \"Any nation who chooses to use an untrustworthy 5G vendor will jeopardize our ability to share Intelligence and information at the highest level.\" Some German politicians objected to this Twitter diplomacy, but Grenell responded, \"No one is threatening you. I could say you are threatening the US that we must continue as usual even when you make dangerous mistakes. We get to have our own policy too.\"\n\nTrump and Grenell have had a contentious relationship with previous DNI Coats, with Trump blocking deputy DNI Sue Gordon from becoming acting director upon Coats' departure in August 2019.",
    " Title: House Approves Stopgap Bill to Avert Government Shutdown, Boost Spending by $300 Billion Over Two Years\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States House of Representatives approved a stopgap bill early on Friday to prevent a government shutdown and increase spending by approximately $300 billion over the next two years. The Senate had passed the bill hours earlier, ensuring a brief end to the government shutdown that commenced at midnight.\n\nThe House voted 240-186 in favor of keeping the government operational for another six weeks. This temporary measure allows lawmakers to begin drafting a comprehensive two-year deal that lifts spending caps on both defense and non-defense spending and suspends the debt ceiling for 13 months, enabling more borrowing.\n\nPresident Trump announced his approval of the measure shortly before 9 a.m. on Friday, praising its support for the military and stating on Twitter that it would also benefit the economy.\n\nDemocrats applauded the significant increase in domestic spending, while Republicans celebrated a larger surge in defense funding. Speaker Paul D. Ryan commented, \"First and foremost, this agreement accomplishes getting the resources that we need to rebuild our military.\" He also highlighted funding for items such as disaster relief and combating the opioid epidemic.\n\nIndividual lawmakers also pointed to various provisions in the bill that would benefit their home states, including tens of billions of dollars in disaster relief for Texas and special protections for dairy farmers that will aid Vermont.\n\nHowever, some liberals criticized the lack of action to protect young illegal immigrant \"Dreamers,\" with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi reiterating her call for a free-ranging debate on the issue. \"Why can't we extend the hand of friendship and protection to our Dreamers?\" Mrs. Pelosi said.\n\nMany House Democrats initially withheld their votes, but more than 70 eventually voted yes to help Republicans pass the bill. More than 60 Republicans still voted no, as some conservatives argued that the budget represented a retreat on the spending cuts the GOP had achieved over the past six years.\n\nThe bill passed the Senate with a 71-28 vote, with support coming relatively evenly from both parties. Sen. Rand Paul had temporarily halted the proceedings in the Capitol, causing the government shutdown\u2014the second of the year. Mr. Paul, the Kentucky Republican who instigated the shutdown with his filibuster, expressed no remorse.\n\n\"Tonight, you could feel the frustration and embarrassment growing in Congress as we exposed the hypocrisy of Republicans who are joining in an unholy alliance and spending spree with Democrats at the expense of the American people and our party's supposed principles,\" Mr. Paul said. \"Make no mistake, I will always stand up for fiscal responsibility, regardless of which party is in power, and I will continue to call the Republican Party home to the ideas that led Americans to trust us with government in the first place.\"",
    " Title: Fatherless Upbringing and Mass Shootings: A Correlation Suggested in Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent analysis suggests a correlation between mass shootings and the absence of a father figure in the perpetrator's upbringing. The piece, which has sparked debate, points out that many mass shooters have not lived full-time with their fathers, a trend that appears to be particularly prevalent among school shooters.\n\nExpanding the definition of \"mass shooter\" to include drug and gang-related violence in urban areas, the fatherless connection becomes more apparent. For instance, in Baltimore, where violence is notoriously high, fewer than 20% of teenagers are being raised by married parents.\n\nThe author, who faced criticism from Media Matters for this observation, proposes a solution that does not involve legislative changes or government intervention. Instead, they suggest addressing the issue by \"raising our own kids,\" emphasizing the importance of staying married, being present, and actively raising children.\n\nThe article acknowledges that this solution would not prevent all acts of violence, but it could have a broader and deeper impact than any legislative action. The negative consequences of fatherlessness are well-established, and the solution, on an individual level, is straightforward: stay married, be present, raise your kids, and love your kids.\n\nThe article argues that a boy growing up without a father will likely experience feelings of abandonment and confusion, which can evolve into deep, simmering anger. This anger, the author suggests, is often not fully understood by the boy, and it is compounded because fathers are best suited to teach their sons how to channel anger and aggression constructively.\n\nFathers, according to the article, also teach their sons how to take healthy risks, how to fight back and stand up to bullies, and how to respect women and protect the weak. While mothers can pass along these life lessons, the article suggests that something is lost in translation, and a mother can only tell a boy how to be a man, while a father can show a boy how to be a man.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that this correlation should not be used as an excuse for mass murderers, who are responsible for their actions regardless of their upbringing. However, it suggests that it is better for children not to have these disadvantages to begin with, and that parents, especially fathers, play a crucial role in this regard. The article encourages a focus on this aspect before worrying about passing new laws.",
    " Title: Immigrant's Life Story Highlights the Human Element in U.S. Immigration Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe story of immigration in the United States is often lost amidst the political debates and polarizing rhetoric, as demonstrated in a poignant personal account by journalist and author Jon Meacham. The article, published in The New York Times, shares the life story of Meacham's father-in-law, Paul Gavora, an immigrant who escaped Communist Czechoslovakia and built a successful life in the United States.\n\nBorn in 1931 in the Slovakian village of Brezova pod Bradlom, Paul experienced the harsh realities of war and political upheaval at a young age. He was expelled from school for questioning Communist doctrine and, at the age of 13, swam the Danube to escape the Communists. After spending time in an Austrian refugee camp, he was sent to Germany to finish high school and eventually earned a scholarship to Colorado State University.\n\nPaul's journey continued as he worked as a milkman, opened a grocery store, and eventually built a business empire in Fairbanks, Alaska. He had nine children and was active in his community. Meacham emphasizes that Paul's story is not about his wealth, but rather the opportunity the United States provided for him to carve out the life he wanted.\n\nMeacham laments the current state of the immigration debate, which he believes has become toxic due to the identity politics of both the Left and the Right. Immigrants are often portrayed as either victims or villains, rather than human beings seeking to make the most of the American dream. Meacham argues that the immigration story in America is one of people leaving or fleeing their birthplaces for the freedom to try their best, a story that belongs to no political party but can be abandoned by either.\n\nThe article serves as a reminder of the human element in the immigration debate, emphasizing the need for empathy and understanding in the face of complex and contentious issues. Meacham's personal account humanizes the immigration issue, highlighting the stories of individuals like Paul Gavora who have contributed to and benefited from the United States.",
    " Title: California Voters to Decide on Cage-Free Farm Animal Standards for Nationwide Producers\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia voters will decide in November whether to implement stricter animal welfare standards for farm animals raised in cages. Proposition 12, a ballot measure, would require more spacious living conditions for pigs, veal calves, and egg-laying hens, not only for animals in California but also for those raised elsewhere and sold in the state.\n\nThe measure is a revised version of a 2008 law, which some farmers found difficult to interpret in practical terms. The Humane Society of the United States and other animal welfare organizations, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Sierra Club, the California Democratic Party, the United Farm Workers, and the Center for Food Safety, support Proposition 12.\n\nThe Yes on 12 campaign has raised $6.1 million as of Sept. 28, while the opponents, Stop the Rotten Egg Initiative, have raised about $566,000. The next financial reporting deadline is Oct. 25.\n\nDede Boies, a farmer who raises chickens, ducks, turkeys, and pigs on Root Down Farm in Pescadero, supports the measure. \"The point for me is to raise animals in a way that they were intended to live,\" says Boies. \"And to basically give them the best life possible.\"\n\nUnder Proposition 12, each farm animal will have a specific amount of floor space beginning in 2020: 43 square feet for a veal calf, 24 square feet for a breeding pig, and 1 square foot for an egg-laying hen. Cage-free conditions will be mandatory for hens by 2022.\n\nThe Association of California Egg Farmers and the National Pork Producers Council oppose Proposition 12 primarily because the measure applies to all veal, pork, and eggs sold in California, even when the animals are raised in other states.\n\nKen Maschhoff, a fifth-generation hog farmer based in Carlyle, Ill., who runs one of the largest pork operations in the U.S., opposes the measure. \"I certainly have a bone to pick with those that try to force their agenda and those costs on to others that would just as soon not bear those,\" says Maschhoff.\n\nWhen his pigs are pregnant, they are confined for about 100 days in a gestation crate that is 7 to 8 feet long and 24 to 30 inches wide. It does not allow the pigs to turn around. Maschhoff argues that confining pigs during pregnancy is both humane and cost-effective because it prevents fighting between the animals, allowing more piglets to survive in the womb.\n\nEconomists find it challenging to forecast exact pork price increases, but egg prices are easier to predict. Cage-free eggs are already available on store shelves and are usually priced at about 50 cents to a dollar more per dozen than conventional eggs.\n\nUniversity of California, Davis economist Dan Sumner estimates that egg prices will increase to $100 to $150 per year for consumers. Another factor that could affect egg prices is an uncertain future, as animal welfare groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals are opposed to the new ballot measure, stating that it does not go far enough to protect chickens, which can still be confined in barns if the proposal passes.\n\nIf voters approve Proposition 12 on Nov. 6, the battle over how much space farm animals need may not be over, as animal welfare groups such as PETA argue that the measure does not go far enough to protect chickens.",

The protests, which have spread across the country, resulted in chaos and violence in some locations, including New York, Atlanta, and Detroit.\n\nIn New York, thousands of protesters gathered at Barclays Center, leading to numerous arrests and the shutdown of a major thoroughfare. In Atlanta, demonstrations turned chaotic, with fires burning in downtown Atlanta near the CNN Center, the network's headquarters. At least one police car was among several vehicles burnt, and windows were smashed at the CNN building, along with storefronts.\n\nIn Brooklyn, police made scores of arrests at Friday's massive demonstration, loading cuffed protesters onto city buses. In lower Manhattan, protesters were pressing for legislation outlawing the police \"chokehold\" used in the 2014 death of Eric Garner, another black man.\n\nBernice King, the youngest daughter of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., implored people to go home after more than 1,000 protesters marched to the state capitol from the Centennial Olympic Park, blocking traffic and an interstate highway along the way.\n\nIn Atlanta, Bernice King delivered an impassioned speech, urging non-violence. \"The only way we get what we really want is through non-violence,\" she said in her father's hometown. \"Let's do this the non-violent way to deal with the evil of our time.\"\n\nIn other cities, protests remained peaceful. Hundreds marched peacefully through Detroit demanding justice for Floyd, while hundreds in the automotive capital joined a \"March Against Police Brutality.\" In Denver, hundreds gathered at City Hall, spilling onto Interstate 45's entrance ramp, chanting \"I can't breathe\" and \"No justice, no peace.\"\n\nIn Houston, Texas, protests over Floyd's death and the shooting death of a 19-year-old man during a protest on Friday night are ongoing. Police could not immediately be reached for comment regarding the shooting incident.\n\nIn Louisville, Kentucky, where Breonna Taylor was shot by police in her home in March, protests are expected to continue over her death and Floyd's.\n\nThe unrest follows the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes during an arrest in Minneapolis on May 25. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers involved in the incident have not been charged.",
    " Title: Supreme Court's 2014 Term Opens with Major Actions in Same-Sex Marriage, Voting Rights, and Abortion Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court commenced its 2014 term this month with significant actions on same-sex marriage, voting rights, and abortion cases, all decided in private without explanation or a breakdown of individual justices' votes. No oral arguments were held, and the two sides in each dispute submitted lengthy briefs outlining their arguments. However, when it came time to rule, the justices did not return the favor.\n\nIn just 17 words on Friday, the court cleared the way for same-sex marriages in Alaska. The justices also did not explain their actions or publicize their votes on the 11 new cases they decided to hear this winter or the more than 1,900 they turned down. They simply issued lists of grants and denials, leaving it to the lawyers and journalists who follow the court to speculate as to the reasons behind their decisions.\n\nEric Segall, a law professor at Georgia State University and co-author of the forthcoming book Supreme Secrecy, stated, \"All of America wants to know what they're thinking, and they refuse to let us know.\" Segall added, \"They want to stay mysterious. They want to stay aloof.\"\n\nThe new term's mystery began to emerge on its opening day. While the justices debated a case that hinged on a broken brake light, their decision not to consider any of the pending same-sex marriage cases was hidden inside an 81-page list of cases similarly denied their day in court.\n\nIn the two weeks since, the court has intervened in a series of cases on gay marriage, voting rights, and abortion to consider emergency appeals. It upheld, reversed, or altered lower court rulings without explanation; only the dissenters explained their votes.\n\nThis is normal operating procedure for the court, and the process has its defenders. If the justices announced their votes on every case they refused to hear, it could affect how future cases on the same topics are litigated and decided. And there simply is not time to write opinions for every emergency petition, which usually require rapid-fire rulings.\n\nWilliam Jay, an appellate lawyer at Goodwin Procter who argues frequently at the court, stated, \"Whenever the Supreme Court writes something, those things can be quoted back at it. There is no such thing as a non-precedential Supreme Court opinion.\"\n\nThere have been instances in the past when the court saw fit to explain even emergency opinions. In 2009, it issued a three-paragraph explanation of its decision not to block the sale of Chrysler's assets during bankruptcy proceedings. And in a 2006 challenge to Arizona's voter ID law, the justices issued a complete ruling that has been cited frequently ever since.\n\nHowever, these are the exceptions. More often, the court's orders read like the one clearing the way for same-sex marriages in Alaska: \"The application for stay presented to Justice Kennedy and by him referred to the court is denied.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, now entering his 10th year on the court and seeking to solidify his central role in its administration and jurisprudence, appeared to be a key player in the past two weeks' somewhat furtive actions.\n\nOn same-sex marriage, he likely was among the justices who refused to grant any cases from Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana, or Wisconsin. That cleared the way for gay and lesbian marriages in those states and others\u2014the single biggest step yet taken toward a 50-state solution.\n\nRoberts also appeared to be a decisive vote in the court's blocking of an anti-abortion law in Texas and a voter ID law in Wisconsin. He sided with the court's conservatives in approving lesser voting restrictions in Ohio.\n\nNow that those decisions are in the history books, court-watchers are left to speculate about Roberts' actual role. Only the justices who dissented in those cases put their names to their actions. The two whose names never appeared\u2014Roberts and Kennedy\u2014assembled the majorities.\n\n\"Even lower courts seeking guidance for their own rulings have been left to guess why the justices issued certain rulings,\" says Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice. \"All of this is harmful to democracy.\" Aron added, \"In exchange for their lifetime appointments, the least that the justices owe the American people is clear explanations for their decisions and their conduct.\"\n\nThat's what the American people get in most instances, Roberts says. \"We are the most transparent branch of government,\" he said in 2011. \"Everything we do that has an impact is done in public\u2026our decisions are out there.\"\n\nHowever, the court has issued lengthy rulings in some blockbusters recently\u2014upholding President Obama's health care law in 2012, striking down key sections of the Voting Rights Act and Defense of Marriage Act last year, and granting religious liberties to for-profit businesses and local governments this year.\n\nBut for the 7,500 or so cases that do not make it to the court's docket, the justices simply refuse to hear them without explanation, as they did in the recent gay marriage cases.\n\nThe court has \"an enormous practical effect in society on people's lives by denying review,\" says Erwin Chemerinsky, founding dean of the University of California-Irvine School of Law and author of the recent book The Case Against the Supreme Court.\n\nChemerinsky notes that without offering explanations or vote counts, the justices in the last few weeks have affected the lives of thousands of voters in Ohio, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, thousands of women seeking abortions in Texas, and thousands of gay and lesbian couples in at least 11 states, from Virginia to Alaska.\n\n\"I can not think of any time when the Supreme Court was having such a practical effect through the preliminary orders they were issuing,\" he says. \"The problem, when it's an order without an opinion, is it just seems arbitrary.\"\n\nIf the justices think they are avoiding controversy by issuing brief, unexplained orders, however, this fall's flurry of rulings may come back to haunt them. That's because the orders are temporary; lower courts still must hear the cases on the merits, and their rulings can be appealed back to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"The\u2026decisions seem to be setting the court up to issue earth-shaking rulings on voting rights, abortion, and marriage equality in the heat of the next presidential election season,\" says Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. \"In the name of prudence, the court is arranging to put itself at the center of the 2016 political maelstrom.\"",

The administration, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, is responsible for the website's issues, which are attributed to both unexpectedly high demand and technical glitches.\n\nThe administration has yet to explain why they failed to anticipate the high demand or provide a clear account of the technical problems and the responsible parties. In response to the website's failures, the administration has implemented a two-part approach. They have enlisted information technology experts from both government and private sectors to work around the clock to resolve the technical issues. Additionally, they have expanded and publicized alternative methods for obtaining information and enrolling in health plans, such as increased call center staffing, in-person counselors (navigators), and downloadable applications for mail-in submission.\n\nPresident Obama also made a commitment to those who encountered difficulties while applying through the federal website. He pledged that, in the coming weeks, they would personally contact those individuals to recommend completion of the application, shopping for coverage, and selecting a suitable plan.",

U.S. retailers including Macy\u2019s Inc (M.N), Saks Fifth Avenue, and Gap Inc\u2019s (GPS.N) Banana Republic have remained open to stem losses due to a steep drop in traffic.\n\nApple's hourly workers will continue to receive pay during this period, and online sales will continue as usual. Cook also stated, \"In all of our offices, we are moving to flexible work arrangements worldwide outside of Greater China. That means team members should work remotely if their job allows.\"\n\nPhiladelphia-based Urban Outfitters also said it would continue to pay its store employees while stores are closed.",
    " Title: Budget Deal Convenient for Congress, Criticized for Nation's Economic Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recently agreed two-year budget deal between Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Paul Ryan is being viewed as a convenient solution for members of Congress, but a less favorable outcome for the nation. The deal, which aims to forestall election year standoffs, has left out key provisions such as an unemployment extension, and includes measures that could potentially slow economic growth.\n\nThe convenience for Congress is primarily due to the fact that the agreement eliminates the possibility of major budget standoffs until at least 2015, thus avoiding the political drama and potential economic instability that has resulted from previous standoffs. However, the deal's impact on the nation is less positive.\n\nOne of the most significant omissions from the deal is the lack of an extension of unemployment benefits. As a result, more than 1 million laid-off workers will see their benefits cut off in 2014. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this will slow growth by 0.2 percentage points and reduce the number of jobs by around 300,000.\n\nWhile Congress did reshuffle funds to make sequester cuts less painful, one item on the reshuffling list deserves special attention. The budget deal would require that federal employees increase their contributions to their retirement, effectively cutting their pay by another 1%. This cut comes on top of pay freezes that have effectively cut real wages by more than 5% over the last three years.\n\nThe biggest issue for most of the public is that this federal budget will continue to impose a drag on the economy by preventing the sort of growth that is needed to return to full employment. While the stimulus approved by Congress boosted growth and added between 2-3 million jobs, the steep deficit reduction of the last three years has slowed the economy, costing millions of jobs.\n\nThe economy still lacks a source of demand to replace the demand generated by the housing bubble. The budget deal negotiated by Murray and Ryan will do nothing to expand demand in the economy. The deal could have devoted funds to rebuilding infrastructure, retrofitting homes and businesses to make them more energy efficient, and improving healthcare and education. Instead, we see further cuts that will lead to deteriorating service and fewer jobs.\n\nIn the longer term, the nation can hope to replace the bubble-generated demand of the last decade with more net exports. This would come about through a lower-valued dollar that would make our goods more competitive internationally. However, a lower-valued dollar is not expected in the immediate future, meaning that as a simple matter of logic, the only way to replace the demand lost due to the collapse of the housing bubble is through the government.\n\nIn conclusion, the budget deal negotiated by Murray and Ryan is being criticized for its potential negative impact on economic growth and employment, particularly due to the lack of unemployment benefit extension and the increased retirement contributions for federal employees. The deal does not address key strategies for economic growth, such as infrastructure investment and energy efficiency projects.",
    " Title: Grass-roots Opposition to Immigration Bill Lags Behind 2007 Levels\n\nArticle:\n\nGrass-roots activists, who were instrumental in derailing the 2007 attempt by Congress to overhaul immigration laws, have yet to ignite a similar level of opposition this time around. Coordinated rallies last week to oppose the current bipartisan immigration legislation drew sparse crowds, with fewer than 10 people showing up for a protest in Dover, Del.\n\nThe current immigration bill, introduced by a group of senators known as the \"Gang of Eight,\" would provide a pathway to citizenship to about 11 million people illegally in the U.S. and create new work visa programs. It would also require the Homeland Security Secretary to submit a border security plan before illegal immigrants gain provisional legal status, the first step in the legalization process. The plan does not have to be implemented for the process to begin, and a system for employment verification would come later.\n\nOpponents of the bill say that, like the 2007 effort, it amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers and does not stem the flow of illegal immigration. Adding legalized immigrants to the workforce would disadvantage jobless Americans, they say.\n\nThis year's bill has not stirred as much opposition. It has more support from mainstream Republicans eager to improve the party's standing with the fast-growing Hispanic population, and from many evangelical Christian leaders. Also, a steep drop in illegal immigration in recent years has meant fewer television images of migrants sneaking into the country.\n\nProtesters at the Phoenix offices of Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake spoke last week against the immigration bill that the lawmakers helped write. However, prospects for the bill's passage appear mixed. The Senate legislation has not yet been tested in that chamber, and efforts by a bipartisan House group to write a similarly broad bill have not succeeded. The path-to-citizenship provision of the Senate bill could prove particularly troubling in the House.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents promise to intensify their campaign. Rusty Childress, who leads \"Remember 1986,\" a group named after the year of the last big immigration overhaul, said his group would start targeting a tea-party base that he said is \"newly energized\" since the IRS news broke.\n\nA fierce backlash against the bill six years ago ultimately spelled its demise because it prompted lawmakers such as Georgia Republican Sens. Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss, who helped draft sections of the measure, to withdraw support. \"The backlash began as soon as an outline for a bill was announced, and it was relentless,\" said Joan Kirchner, a top aide to Mr. Isakson. Neither of the Georgia senators has taken a public position on this year's bill.\n\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Isakson's office has been receiving about 100 calls a day versus as many as 2,000 a day in 2007. The volume is expected to rise if a bill reaches the floor, Ms. Kirchner said, \"but signs are it won't be as intense.\" Activists said they are planning a protest outside Mr. Isakson's Atlanta office in early June.\n\nMichael Harrison, publisher of Talkers, a talk-radio trade magazine, said many influential hosts have \"moved on\" to discuss gun control, health care, and other \"hit topics\" because \"the public's attitude is different on immigration.\"\n\nAlan Ogushoff, who made protest calls to Mr. Chambliss's office in 2007, often several times a day, said he remains a foe of any legalization. But, the avid listener of conservative talk radio said, \"I'm just going to let this happen and move on; I'm burned out fighting it.\"\n\nRoy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that channeled opposition to the 2007 bill into a barrage of calls and emails to lawmakers, agreed \"there may be some fatigue\" now. However, the group over the weekend said it unveiled TV and radio ads in 18 states opposing the bill. One radio script warning of the dangers of adding more potential workers says: \"Jobs\u201420 million of our friends, family, and neighbors still can't find one.\"\n\nGroups pressing for an immigration overhaul, such as businesses and undocumented youngsters, also have been more vocal. The Evangelical Immigration Table, made up of leaders of Christian groups, this week will launch a new round of national radio ads to promote the bill.\n\n\"This time, there is not as much emotion on our side,\" said Mr. Beck of NumbersUSA. But, \"I do not know if that means there is less resolve.\"",
    " Title: Record Number of People Sign Up for Health Insurance on HealthCare.gov Ahead of Deadline\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama announced on Friday that more than 670,000 people signed up for health insurance on HealthCare.gov on Thursday, marking the highest number of enrollees since the launch of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges three years ago. This figure surpasses the 600,000 people who signed up last year on Dec. 15.\n\nDespite technical issues that caused approximately 1 million people to leave their contact information as they were unable to access the site, the surge in signups prompted the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to extend the deadline for enrollment on the federal exchange until 11:59 PM PST on Dec. 19. HealthCare.gov handles enrollment for 38 states. Deadlines for state exchanges vary, but several allow enrollment for Jan. 1 coverage for a few more days.\n\nSignups rose steadily this week, with more than 325,000 Americans selecting plans on HealthCare.gov on Monday and more than 380,000 Americans doing so on Tuesday, marking two of the biggest days in HealthCare.gov's history.\n\nThe administration has been actively promoting the law, as Republican members of Congress and President-elect Donald Trump have vowed to repeal it next month. Even with a repeal, individuals who do not have insurance through their jobs will still be required to buy it at least through 2017 and likely longer. A plan to replace the ACA could take several years.\n\nEarlier this week, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell went on a four-city tour to Tampa, Orlando, New York, and East Newark, N.J., to meet with people who have benefited from the ACA and encourage Americans to get covered.

    " Title: Trump Suggests Rick Perry's Role in Ukraine Call, Amidst Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump reportedly stated during a meeting that he did not initially want to make the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but did so at the request of Energy Secretary Rick Perry. This revelation comes as the president has maintained that his call with Zelensky was \"perfect\" and he did nothing wrong.\n\nThree sources confirmed the president's comments, with one source recalling Trump saying, \"Not a lot of people know this, but I didn't even want to make the call. The only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to. Something about an LNG [liquefied natural gas] plant.\"\n\nThe president's remarks suggest he may be seeking to distance himself from responsibility or recast the pretext for the call. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnother source on the call said Trump added that \"more of this will be coming out in the next few days\" \u2014 referring to Perry.\n\nText messages released this week between Trump administration officials and Andrey Yermak, a top aide to Zelensky, suggest that Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was a primary advocate for arranging the call. However, there is no mention in the text messages of Perry playing a role in making this call happen.\n\nPerry, who is reportedly resigning by the end of this year, has become increasingly embroiled in congressional Democrats' impeachment inquiry. In May, Perry led a U.S. delegation to Ukraine for Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in place of Vice President Mike Pence, and Democrats have begun to press Perry for more information about the trip and his conversations with Ukrainian leaders.\n\nThe House subpoena of Rudy Giuliani also seeks documents related to Perry's \"involvement with Ukrainian leaders last spring.\" However, Perry told the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday that, \"as God is my witness,\" neither Joe or Hunter Biden's name ever came up.\n\nPerry's spokeswoman, Shaylyn Hynes, told a news outlet, \"Secretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development.\"\n\n\"He continues to believe that there is significant need for improved regional energy security\u2014which is exactly why he is heading to Lithuania tonight to meet with nearly 2 dozen European energy leaders (including Ukraine) on these issues,\" Hynes added.\n\nThe White House acknowledged the conference call in a Friday readout that said participants included Minority Leader McCarthy, Whip Steve Scalise, Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney, and GOP leaders on key House committees\u2014and that they discussed Friday's jobs report, the economy, and concerns about Democrats' impeachment inquiry.",
    " Title: Trump Suggests Trump National Doral Resort as Venue for 2020 G7 Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has proposed hosting the 2020 Group of Seven (G7) summit at his own Trump National Doral golf resort near Miami, Florida. The G7 countries traditionally take turns hosting the summit, often choosing locations that showcase areas of natural beauty.\n\nDuring this year's G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Trump highlighted the resort's size and proximity to Miami International Airport as reasons for its suitability. He stated, \"They love the location of the hotel, they also like the fact it's right next to the airport for convenience. And it is Miami, Doral, Miami, so it is a great area.\"\n\nTrump added that a final decision has not been made yet, but noted that no other location has come close to competing with the resort, particularly in terms of location.\n\nIn a subsequent news conference, Trump asserted that he would not directly benefit financially from hosting the G7 at his resort, stating, \"From my standpoint, I'm not going to make any money. In my opinion, I'm not going to make any money.\"\n\nTrump has attended three G7 summits, in Italy, Canada, and France. In the past, the meetings have been held at locations far from airports that can accommodate Air Force One, requiring the president to be transported by helicopter or a smaller plane. Trump noted the convenience of the Doral resort's proximity to an airport.\n\nAlthough Trump criticized the need to switch planes during the France summit, he praised the setup in Biarritz, citing the conference center's architecture and room design. However, Trump did not indicate any intention to invite unexpected guests, as France did by inviting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif for talks on the sidelines of the gathering.",
    " Title: Understanding the \"Three R's\" of Police Reform: Reduce, Reinvent, and Redeploy\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the debate over police funding gains momentum across the United States, many Americans are seeking clarity on the concept of \"defunding the police.\" While some interpret it as a call for the complete abolition of law enforcement, others view it as a specific set of policy proposals aimed at reforming the police force.\n\nOne such proposal, as presented by Randal Mayer, a former Cato policy analyst and justice reform advocate, outlines the \"three R's of police reform\": Reduce, Reinvent, and Redeploy.\n\nThe \"Reduce\" component involves cutting expenditures on militarized equipment, over-policing minor violations, and militarized training. Instead, funds would be allocated towards clearing backlogs of rape kits and increasing the number of detectives for investigating serious and violent crimes, which are often left unsolved. Additionally, states would reduce officers with poor records, and implement subsidized malpractice insurance for police, making them more accountable for wrongdoing.\n\nThe \"Reinvent\" aspect focuses on transforming police departments into community-focused organizations that prioritize de-escalation training and culture. This includes changing military-style rankings, recruitment tactics, and the overall culture of police departments, as well as altering engagement rules to minimize potential harm to suspects. Furthermore, it involves redefining the concept of \"calling the police\" to prioritize help and non-fatal conflict resolution over a SWAT-style response to situations such as mental health check-ins.\n\nLastly, the \"Redeploy\" component entails deploying newly trained and cultured police in the community to maintain law and order, while holding police accountable for their conduct and actions.\n\nRegardless of one's stance on the \"defund the police\" issue, these proposals raise questions worth considering, such as the role we want police to play in our communities and the culture we want our law enforcement to embody.\n\nTo stay updated on these and other issues, subscribe to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 newsletter here.",
    " Title: Armed Protesters Occupy Oregon Wildlife Refuge, Demand Release of Local Ranchers\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of armed protesters, now known as Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, have taken control of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. The group, led by Ammon Bundy, son of Cliven Bundy who was involved in a similar standoff in 2014, is demanding an end to what they perceive as \"abuses\" against local ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond.\n\nThe Hammonds were convicted of arson in 2012 for fires that occurred on federal land in 2001 and 2006. Despite serving their original sentences, an appellate judge ruled in October that the terms were too short under federal minimum sentencing laws. The Hammonds were ordered to serve four more years in prison, with Dwight and Steven arriving at the Terminal Island Federal Correctional Institution on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn a statement, the Hammonds' attorneys said, \"Dwight and Steven Hammond respect the rule of law. They have litigated this matter within the federal courts for over five years and, in every instance, have followed the order of the court without incident or violation.\"\n\nAmmon Bundy accused federal officials of launching an \"attack\" on the Hammonds for refusing to sell their land. The protesters took over the refuge on Saturday after participating in a peaceful rally.\n\nHarney County Sheriff Dave Ward has criticized the protesters, stating, \"These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States.\"\n\nThe FBI has called for a \"peaceful resolution\" to the standoff, but has not provided specific details about their response due to \"safety considerations for both those inside the refuge as well as the law enforcement officers involved.\"\n\nAmmon Bundy's brother, Ryan, stated that the protesters plan to remain at the refuge as long as necessary. If the situation becomes violent, he attributes it to the federal government's actions. \"We're here to restore order, we're here to restore rights, and that can go peacefully and easily,\" Ryan Bundy said.\n\nThe Hammonds have claimed that they lit the fires in 2001 and 2006 to reduce the growth of invasive plants and protect their property from wildfires. However, prosecutors maintain that the fires were set to cover up poaching activities.\n\nThe ongoing dispute between the federal government and some Westerners over the use of public lands dates back to the 1970s and the \"Sagebrush Rebellion,\" a movement by Western states like Nevada to increase local control over federal land. Critics of the push for more local control have argued that the federal government should administer the public lands for the widest possible uses, including environmental and recreational purposes.",
    " Title: Trump Appoints Kellyanne Conway as Counselor, Establishing Three Power Centers in His Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has appointed Kellyanne Conway as his counselor, installing her as the highest-ranking woman in the White House. This move, along with the appointments of Sean Spicer as press secretary, Jason Miller as communications director, Hope Hicks as strategic communications director, and Dan Scavino as social media director, has established three competing power centers in the Trump administration.\n\nIn a statement, Trump praised Conway, stating, \"Kellyanne Conway has been a trusted advisor and strategist who played a crucial role in my victory. She is a tireless and tenacious advocate of my agenda and has amazing insights on how to effectively communicate our message. I am pleased that she will be part of my senior team in the West Wing.\"\n\nConway, who joined Trump's campaign as it was mired in controversy over the summer and managed it to a surprise victory last month, had previously expressed hesitation about accepting a White House role due to the time it would take her away from her four young children. However, she ultimately accepted the position, citing Trump's persuasive nature.\n\nIn her new role, Conway will work with senior leadership to effectively message and execute the administration's legislative priorities and actions. She will also continue to play a role in communications, alongside Spicer, Hicks, Miller, and Scavino.\n\nConway's duties and responsibilities will not be modeled after any particular predecessor but will be specific to Trump's administration. She is expected to continue serving as a \"discreet advisor\" and support Trump in his effective connecting and communicating with America.\n\nConway's appointment follows weeks of rumors and jockeying for position among Trump's campaign veterans and supporters. Some longtime aides have expressed concern about being frozen out in favor of more recent hires like Conway and Miller and members of the GOP establishment like Spicer and incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.\n\nThe flurry of announcements on Thursday ended with the appointment of Steve Bannon as chief strategist, setting up three competing power centers in the Trump administration: Priebus as chief of staff, Bannon as chief strategist, Conway as counselor, and Spicer as press secretary.",
    " Title: Clarification on President Trump's Remarks at Press Conference\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference on Friday, President Donald Trump discussed job numbers and the role of the National Guard in limiting damage caused by riots and looting. Several news outlets, including ABC News, Business Insider, the Independent, and the New York Daily News, reported that Trump said he hoped George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody, was looking down from heaven and was happy about the improving job numbers.\n\nHowever, a closer examination of the president's remarks reveals that Trump was not referring to the jobs numbers when he mentioned George Floyd. The comments in question came immediately after Trump discussed the role of the National Guard in limiting damage caused by riots and looting, contrasting places like Minnesota, where the National Guard was active, with New York.\n\nTrump said:\n\n\"Equal justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement, regardless of race, color, gender, or creed. They have to receive fair treatment from law enforcement. They have to receive it. We all saw what happened last week. We can't let that happen. Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying, 'This is a great thing that's happening for our country.' This is a great day for him. This is a great day for everybody. This is a great day for everybody. This is a great, great day in terms of equality.\"\n\nWhile there are reasonable arguments to be made that Trump's comments were tone-deaf, given that he mentioned \"George\" immediately after talking about \"equal justice under the law\" and \"fair treatment from law enforcement,\" and then followed by calling it a \"great day in terms of equality,\" it is clear that Trump was referring to equal justice under the law when he mentioned Floyd. He was not \"imagining George Floyd's reaction to the jobs numbers.\"",
    " Title: Political Polarization and Income Inequality: A Growing Connection\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in the Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties suggests that political polarization is a significant factor contributing to income inequality in the United States. The study, which focuses on the economic priorities of the two major American political parties, concludes that the partisan difference in policy reflects the redistributive impact of these policies on the core constituents of the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nAccording to the study, Democrats are primarily concerned with unemployment, while Republicans focus on inflation and wages. This seesawing of economic priorities, the study argues, leads to \"another pathway by which inequality is transmitted.\"\n\nGillian B. White, writing for The Atlantic, notes that this mounting polarization in America may result in political leaders prioritizing their core supporters, potentially leaving others economically disadvantaged.\n\nThis finding is not unique to this study. A Princeton study, which looked at voter partisanship and income, found that from 1956 to 1996, partisanship has become more stratified by income. In recent years, party affiliation has reportedly become directly tied to one's tax bracket.\n\nAnother study, released last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, found a link between income inequality and political polarization. The study concludes that both income inequality and political polarization are endogenous (or internal) variables that feed back on each other.\n\nWhile the idea that party polarization is negatively impacting the fight to curb income inequality is not new, it is important to remember that this wasn't always the case. Historically, both parties had a mixture of rich and poor constituents that voted their interests, maintaining an economic balance for much of the second half of the 20th century.\n\nHowever, this is no longer the case, and such a change isn't doing the economy any favors. The studies suggest that the increase in political polarization and income inequality began in the 1970s.",

Bush has announced his intention to support several Republican incumbent senators in the 2016 election, marking a shift from his previous political abstention since the end of his second term in 2008. The New York Times reports that Bush will be campaigning for Sens. Roy Blunt (R-MO), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Rob Portman (R-OH) in the coming weeks.\n\nBush has also participated in fundraisers for Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and John McCain (R-AZ). This decision to engage in the election cycle comes as his approval ratings seem to be on the rise, with 52 percent of Americans having a favorable impression of him in a 2015 CNN poll, up from around a third of the public approving of him in 2009.\n\nThe shift in Bush's political involvement may be due to the unfavorability of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. According to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll, Trump's disapproval rating has reached an all-time high at 70 percent. This has caused some senators in tight races to distance themselves from Trump, even retracting previous endorsements.\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) has stated that she will \"support, but not endorse\" Trump. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) echoed Ayotte's sentiment, saying, \"To me, support versus endorse are two totally different things. I intend to support.\"\n\nLast month, both George W. and George H.W. Bush stated they had no plans to endorse Trump as the presidential candidate or attend the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer. Now, the 43rd president hopes to use his influence to maintain the Republican-held Senate as a \"check and balance\" on the White House. The potential president he refers to was not specified.",
    " Title: US Attorney General William Barr Refuses to Testify Before Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee on Russia Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Attorney General William Barr has declined to testify before the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee regarding his handling of the Russia inquiry. The standoff between the committee and the Justice Department raises the possibility that Barr, the nation's top legal official, could be held in contempt of Congress.\n\nThe Justice Department also stated that it would not comply with a subpoena issued by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler for an unredacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report and files from the investigation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Barr was questioned by a Senate panel about his decision to clear President Donald Trump of obstruction of justice. His defense of his actions before the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee followed Mueller's expressed frustration over the report summary. Mueller is expected to testify to Congress later this month.\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Justice said that Nadler had imposed conditions on the House Judiciary Committee hearing that were \"unprecedented and unnecessary.\" The department argued that the planned move to have attorneys question Barr was unnecessary because most of the committee members were lawyers.\n\nHowever, Nadler told reporters that Barr was afraid to testify on Thursday, stating, \"He is terrified of having to face a skilled attorney.\" He added, \"We plan on subpoenaing him if he decides not to show up. He can run but he can't hide.\"\n\nBarr testified for the first time on Wednesday since the release of Mueller's 448-page report. The special counsel did not establish any collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. However, the report did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. It concluded that the Republican president had repeatedly intervened with an inquiry that he feared would doom his presidency.\n\nBarr, who was appointed by Trump, told the Senate Judiciary Committee he was \"frankly surprised\" Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the president had tried to obstruct justice. The attorney general added that he was \"absolutely\" confident in his own judgment that Trump did not unlawfully attempt to impede the investigation.\n\nBarr's testimony came after a letter he had received from Mueller was made public. In the document, the special counsel stated that Barr's summary \"did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance\" of his report's findings, and caused \"public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation.\" The letter, dated March 27, expressed Mueller's frustration that Barr had not released the executive summaries prepared by the special counsel's team.\n\nDuring the hearing, Barr said that Mueller was not concerned with the accuracy of the summary, but with how it was being reported by media. \"My understanding was his concern was not the accuracy of the statement of the findings in my letter, but that he wanted more out there to provide additional context to explain his reasoning and why he did not reach a decision on obstruction,\" he said.\n\nBarr argued that the objections to his summary should be nullified by the release of the report itself, calling the controversy surrounding the summary, and the consequent hearings, \"mind-bendingly bizarre.\" \"I made clear from the beginning that I was putting out the report, as much of the report as I could, and it was clear it was going to take three weeks or so, maybe four,\" Mr. Barr said.",

The controversy over Trump's pursuit of a Trump Tower in Russia resurfaced after his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to making false statements about his involvement in pursuing the deal.\n\nTrump tweeted, \"I am a very good developer, happily living my life, when I see our Country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly). Against all odds, I decide to run for President & continue to run my business-very legal & very cool, talked about it on the campaign trail... Lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in Russia... Put up zero money, zero guarantees and didn\u2019t do the project. Witch Hunt!\"\n\nTrump called Cohen a \"liar\" and a \"weak person\" shortly after news broke earlier Thursday that Cohen had pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress in a deal with special counsel Robert Mueller, a significant development in the investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nCohen appeared in federal court in Manhattan Thursday where he entered a guilty plea to making misstatements to Congress in closed-door testimony last year about his contacts with Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump's dealings with Cohen, while serving as a senior executive in Trump's global empire, include several projects thought to be of interest to Mueller's prosecutors, most notably the pursuit of a Trump Tower project in Moscow during the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to court documents, Cohen falsely told Congress the Moscow project ended in January 2016. He then continued to look into business plans on that deal, according to the court filing. Cohen made false statements \"in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations,\" according to the filing signed by Mueller.\n\nTrump insisted there would not have been anything wrong with continuing business dealings during the campaign. \"Now, here's the thing, even if he was right, it does not matter, because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign,\" Trump said. \"There was a good chance that I would not have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said he ultimately decided to pass on the project \"for a lot of reasons,\" but primarily because he was focused on running for president. \"It lasted a short period of time. I did not do the project. I decided not to do the project,\" Trump said. \"This deal was a very public deal. Everybody knows about this deal. I was not trying to hide anything, okay?\"\n\nWhen asked why, if Cohen is \"weak\" and a \"liar,\" the president kept a close relationship with him for over a decade, Trump gave a vague response. \"Because a long time ago he did me a favor,\" Trump said.\n\nDespite the plea deal, Trump said he's \"not worried at all\" about what Cohen might be telling Mueller. Cohen has spent over 70 hours in interviews with Mueller's team since coming to another plea deal in August with federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York that in which Cohen implicated Trump in campaign finance felonies.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Thursday's news a \"very significant plea and statement.\"\n\n\"It means that when the president was representing during the campaign that he had no business interests in Russia, that that wasn\u2019t true, and when Mr. Cohen testified before our committee, as well as the Senate, and made representations about when the business dealing with Russia stopped, that wasn\u2019t true,\" Schiff said.\n\n\"This, I think, only underscores the importance of our bringing back Mr. Cohen before our committee, but also looking into this issue of whether the Russians possess financial leverage over the president of the United States,\" he said.\n\nTrump, as he did Thursday, has previously denied that he has any business deals with Russia, tweeting shortly before he was inaugurated, \"I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA -- NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\"",
    " Title: Saudi Court Sentences Five to Death, Three to Prison in Jamal Khashoggi Murder Case\n\nArticle:\n\nSaudi Arabia's criminal court has sentenced five individuals to death and three to prison over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but a United Nations (U.N.) investigator has accused the kingdom of making a \"mockery\" of justice by allowing the masterminds of the killing to go free.\n\nA Saudi court, in a ruling that contradicts the findings of a U.N.-led investigation, rejected the premeditated nature of the killing, stating it was carried out \"at the spur of the moment.\" Saudi Deputy Public Prosecutor and spokesman Shalaan al-Shalaan said the court dismissed charges against three of the 11 people tried, finding them not guilty.\n\nThe U.S., a critic of Saudi Arabia's handling of the killing, called the verdicts \"an important step\" in holding those responsible accountable. The U.S. will continue to press for full accountability, according to another senior U.S. official. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and critic of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, and his body has not been found.\n\nA source familiar with U.S. intelligence assessments said key U.S. government agencies rejected the validity of the court proceedings, and CIA experts still believe the crown prince personally ordered, or at least approved of, the killing. The five men condemned to death were essentially foot soldiers in the killing, while two senior security officials acquitted played a more significant role.\n\nA Saudi prosecutor said there was no evidence connecting one of those senior officials, Saud al-Qahtani, to the killing, and the court dismissed charges against Ahmed al-Asiri, a former deputy intelligence chief.\n\nThe U.N.-led inquiry, published in February, reported that the evidence pointed to \"a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated\" by Saudi officials. The publisher of the Washington Post, a newspaper for which Khashoggi wrote a column, said the lack of transparency and the Saudi government's refusal to cooperate with independent investigators suggested \"a sham trial.\"\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International said the verdict was a \"whitewash\" that failed to address the Saudi authorities' involvement or the location of Khashoggi's remains. However, one of Khashoggi's sons said the verdicts had been fair to his children.\n\nLast November, the Saudi prosecutor said Qahtani, a former high-profile Saudi royal adviser, had discussed Khashoggi's activities before he entered the Saudi consulate with the team that went on to kill him. Both Qahtani and Asiri were dismissed from their positions, but while Asiri was tried, Qahtani was not. On Monday, Shalaan said Asiri has been tried and released due to insufficient evidence, and Qahtani had been investigated but was not charged and had been released.\n\nThe trial proceedings were held in secretive sessions in the capital Riyadh, and none of the names of the defendants was immediately released. Agnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur for extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions, said the trial verdict was a \"mockery\" of justice. \"The hit-men are guilty, sentenced to death. The masterminds not only walk free, they have barely been touched by the investigation and the trial,\" she said on Twitter.",
    " Title: US Repatriates Hundreds of Citizens from Coronavirus-Stricken Cruise Ship in Japan; China Reports Increase in Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo planes carrying approximately 400 US citizens, who were on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, have arrived in the United States. One plane landed at a US Air Force base in California, and the other in Texas. The passengers will be isolated at military facilities for a 14-day quarantine period.\n\nThe Diamond Princess, with around 3,700 passengers and crew, has been in quarantine since February 3. The ship was placed in quarantine in Japan's port of Yokohama after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to have the virus.\n\nMeanwhile, China has reported 2,051 new cases in the past 24 hours, with 94% of the new cases originating from Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. As of the latest reports, more than 70,600 people across China have been infected by the virus, with 1,771 deaths. Most new cases and deaths have been reported in Wuhan, Hubei's largest city.\n\nIn Japan, a public gathering to celebrate the birthday of new Emperor Naruhito later this week has been cancelled due to concerns over the spread of the virus. Additionally, organisers of the Tokyo marathon due to take place on March 1 have cancelled the amateur part of the race, affecting some 38,000 runners, after cases of the virus were confirmed in the city. Only elite runners will be allowed to take part.\n\nChina's National People's Congress standing committee is scheduled to meet next week to discuss a possible delay of this year's Congress, the Communist Party's most important annual gathering, due to the outbreak.\n\nAt the weekend, an American woman tested positive for the virus in Malaysia after leaving a cruise ship docked off the coast of Cambodia. There are concerns for other passengers on the cruise, who are now dispersed around the world.\n\nA Russian woman who was ordered to go back to a quarantine facility by a St Petersburg court has returned to hospital. Last week, Alla Ilyina escaped from the facility after testing negative three times for the virus, but was told to remain quarantined for two weeks.\n\nMore than 300 passengers were repatriated voluntarily, according to the US State Department. Fourteen of them were reported during transit to have tested positive for the virus and were being kept separate from the other passengers. They will all undergo a 14-day quarantine, on top of the time they have already spent confined on the ship.\n\nUS officials later said 13 of the passengers thought to be \"high risk\" were sent on to a special facility at the University of Nebraska in Omaha. At least 40 US citizens who were already showing symptoms prior to the evacuation were not allowed on the planes and would be treated in Japan.\n\nSome Americans have declined to be evacuated, preferring to wait until the ship quarantine comes to an end on February 19. Passenger Matt Smith, a lawyer, said he would not want to travel on a bus to the plane with possibly infected people.\n\nAccording to official figures for February 16, 100 people died from the virus in Hubei, down from 139 on Saturday. The Chinese authorities are tightening curbs on movement to combat the outbreak. People in Hubei province, which has 60 million people, have been ordered to stay at home, though they will be allowed to leave in an emergency.\n\nIn addition, a single person from each household will be allowed to leave the building or compound they live in every three days to buy food and essential items. On housing estates, one entrance will be kept open, guarded to ensure that only residents can enter or leave.\n\nAll businesses will stay closed, except chemists, hotels, food shops, and medical services. There will be a ban on the use of private cars, but vehicles used for the delivery of essential goods are exempt.\n\nIn the Chinese capital, Beijing, authorities have ordered everyone returning to the city to go into quarantine for 14 days or risk punishment. China's central bank will also disinfect and store used banknotes before recirculating them in a bid to stop the virus spreading.\n\nNew cases spiked last week after a change in the way they were counted, but have been falling since. National Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said the figures showed China was managing to curb the outbreak.\n\nTaiwan has reported a death from the illness - a taxi driver, 61, who had not travelled abroad recently but had diabetes and hepatitis B, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said. The minister said many of his passengers had come from China.\n\nOutside China, there have been more than 600 cases in nearly 30 countries. Four others have died outside mainland China - in France, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Japan. The virus is a new strain of coronavirus and causes an acute respiratory disease, which has been named Covid-19.\n\nFor further information or to speak to a BBC journalist, please contact us via the following methods: [contact information].",
    " Title: Hong Kong Protests: Global Support for Demonstrators and Calls for U.S. Action\n\nArticle:\n\nHong Kong experienced a lockdown on Tuesday, with barricades in the city center, shuttered stores, and a heavy riot police presence, as authorities attempted to prevent protests from overshadowing China's National Day festivities in Beijing. The former British colony has been experiencing nearly four months of street clashes and demonstrations.\n\nThe protests have garnered worldwide attention, with protesters using a DIY approach to reach a global audience. Celebrity supporters testify in high-profile settings, crowdfunded media campaigns aim to keep the issue in the spotlight, and viral videos, catchy slogans, and a movement anthem and flag help magnify the message on social media.\n\nThe protests are a response to concerns that Beijing and its selected local government are violating the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which guaranteed Hong Kong's autonomy. Residents fear they are losing the political system they inherited from Britain, a system they know and trust.\n\nThe people of Hong Kong are sending a clear message to the Chinese government: they do not want the political system Beijing is offering; they want freedom and democracy. The United States is being called upon to answer this call with moral and diplomatic support and to work diligently to ensure democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.\n\nThe opportunity to turn the tide against tyranny is one that is not to be squandered. Over the last year, millions of people have risked their lives to challenge tyrannical regimes around the world, including in Venezuela, Sudan, and Algeria. The protestors in Hong Kong understand the history of tyranny and still choose to stand in the street and fight for their future.\n\nThe United States is being urged to immediately pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019. This legislation would proactively enshrine American support for Hong Kong's democracy and autonomy into law and send a powerful symbolic message to the people of Hong Kong that American support for Hong Kong is more than just empty words. The bill would require the State Department to annually certify and report to Congress whether Hong Kong's status of autonomy and the government's adherence to protecting civil liberties and upholding the rule of law justify its continued special status. The Commerce Department would also submit an annual report to Congress that determines if China is exploiting Hong Kong to circumvent U.S. sanctions and export controls. This important bill would also ensure that violators of human rights in the region are held accountable by applying sanctions and banning entry to the U.S.\n\nLeaders in Congress on both sides of the aisle have made strong statements condemning the Chinese and Hong Kong governments' actions, but now is the time to attach action to words. The passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act would not only be a momentous symbolic statement that the world still cares about the people of Hong Kong, but it would help incentivize the Hong Kong government to respect people's freedoms. It is time for the act to be passed.",
    " Title: Three Dead in Fatal Shooting Outside Oklahoma Walmart\n\nArticle:\n\nDUNCAN, Oklahoma (AP) \u2014 A shooting incident occurred outside a Walmart store in southwestern Oklahoma on Monday, November 18, 2019, resulting in the deaths of two men and a woman. The shooter is among the deceased, authorities confirmed.\n\nAccording to Police Chief Danny Ford, the victims were shot in a car parked outside the store in Duncan before 10 a.m. The shooter is believed to have shot the male and female victims and then turned the gun on himself, as per Ford's statement to The \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nStephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks stated during a news conference Monday afternoon that there was no active shooter inside the store, and he described the shooting as an isolated incident. Hicks did not provide further details.\n\nTwo bodies, covered with sheets, were visible in the parking lot Monday afternoon. One body was in the driver's seat of a red, two-door car, while the other body was lying on the ground next to the vehicle. Bullet holes were visible in the car's windshield, and police reported finding a handgun at the scene.\n\nAuthorities have not released the identities of those killed, but they confirmed that the shooter was among the dead. Ford stated that all three knew each other but declined to describe their relationships or other identifying information pending notification of immediate family. He also confirmed that all three were dead when police arrived just minutes after the shooting.\n\nWalmart spokeswoman LeMia Jenkins initially stated that no staff were involved. Jenkins later released a statement offering thoughts and prayers for the family of the woman killed in the shooting, who she said had been with the company for less than two months. Jenkins stated that the woman was at the Walmart during her free time and was not scheduled to work that day.\n\nDuncan is a city of more than 22,000 residents located about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City. The Walmart is in a commercial center that includes a sporting goods store and a dollar store along U.S. Highway 81, the main road that passes through Duncan heading south toward Texas.\n\nAaron Helton, of Duncan, said he was parking outside the Walmart where he planned to buy groceries when he heard about nine gunshots. Helton was one of many nearby witnesses who fortunately was not hit by gunfire. The closest person was in a vehicle three parking spaces away from where the victims sat, Ford said.\n\n\"We got radio of a lot of people dodging and running,\" Ford said. \"There were people in the vicinity, for sure.\"\n\nThere were more than 100 vehicles in the parking lot about two hours after the shooting, plus a steady stream of customers coming and going from Walmart, which remained open for business.\n\nThis shooting marks at least the third incident at a Walmart in the U.S. this year. A Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, reopened Thursday after being closed since August, when a gunman opened fire in the busy store, killing 22. Just days before, two Walmart employees in Mississippi were killed by a man authorities described as a disgruntled Walmart worker.\n\nThe killings in Oklahoma come amid a spate of high-profile shootings across the U.S. A 16-year-old student at a high school in the city of Santa Clarita outside Los Angeles shot and killed two classmates and wounded three other teens Thursday before shooting himself in the head. He died the next day.\n\nIn New Jersey, players and spectators ran for cover Friday night when a gunman opened fire at a high school football game, wounding two people. And on Sunday, four people were killed and six wounded in Fresno, California, where police say two shooters sneaked into a backyard party and shot into a group of Hmong family and friends.",
    " Title: Senate Election Outlook: Democrats Face Uphill Battle for Control\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Election Day approaches, polls indicate that Democrats face an uphill battle in their quest to regain control of the Senate. The party is defending more seats than the Republicans, including many in conservative states. However, several key races remain close, and Democrats have paths to retake the chamber, albeit difficult ones.\n\nDemocrats are defending 26 seats, while Republicans are defending nine. The latest RealClearPolitics polling averages for key Democratic-held seats are as follows:\n\n- In Missouri, Indiana, Florida, Montana, and West Virginia, Democrats lead by 2 to 11 points.\n- In North Dakota, the race is very close, with zero to 2 points separating the candidates.\n\nFor the four main Republican-held seats Democrats are targeting, the RealClearPolitics averages currently show:\n\n- In Nevada and Arizona, the races are very close, with zero to 2 points separating the candidates.\n- In Texas and Tennessee, Republicans lead by 5 to 6 points.\n\nA \"jungle primary\" is taking place in Mississippi today, which will likely advance one Republican and one Democratic candidate to a runoff election, scheduled for the end of the month.\n\nDemocrats need to gain two GOP-held seats for a majority. However, they also have more imperiled incumbents, and for each one who loses, they'd have to pick off another GOP-held seat to keep their hopes of Senate control alive. These polls are why every pundit and forecaster agrees that Republicans are the favorite to hold the majority.\n\nWhile Republicans are playing whack-a-mole against Democratic challengers in the House, it's Democrats who are faced with that difficult task in the Senate. The challenge is that for each Democratic incumbent who loses, the number of Republicans who have to be defeated goes up\u2014and that, very quickly, Democrats run out of targets.\n\nIf Democrats win every Senate race where there's a difference of 5 points or fewer between the candidates right now, as well as all the other races they currently lead by larger margins, they would deliver them two pickups of GOP-held seats, in Nevada and Arizona, in addition to getting almost every Democratic incumbent reelected. This would get them within one seat of a majority\u2014because of the expected loss of Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), the sole Democratic incumbent who has fallen behind her Republican challenger substantially in RealClearPolitics' average (she trails by 11 points).\n\nIf Heitkamp does lose, Democrats need to find another pickup somewhere for a majority. They'd likely have to pin their hopes on either Phil Bredesen from Tennessee or Beto O'Rourke (D-TX), hoping one of them pulls off an impressive upset (both currently trail by 5 to 6 points, per RealClearPolitics).\n\nIf another Democratic incumbent were to lose as well (say, Missouri's Claire McCaskill or Indiana's Joe Donnelly, who are both in races that polls show are about tied), the party would probably have to make up for it with both Bredesen and O'Rourke winning. If three Democratic incumbents lose, that ends the party's hopes for a majority, barring some total stunner elsewhere (such as in that Mississippi runoff that will likely be held at the end of November).\n\nIt's worth noting that the median outcome in FiveThirtyEight's classic forecast is for a 51-49 Senate controlled by Republicans, but their model does give Democrats about a one-in-five chance of taking over the chamber. This is largely because it's not uncommon for polls to be off by 5 or 6 points in Senate races. In recent years, there have been substantial polling errors in several Senate races. For example, in 2012, Democratic Senate candidates outperformed their polls by 6 points or more in North Dakota, Connecticut, Florida, and Missouri. In 2014, Republicans did so in Kansas, West Virginia, Arkansas, Virginia, Kentucky, and Iowa. In 2016, Republicans did so in Wisconsin and Indiana.\n\nDemocrats do, then, have something to hope for. However, one potential fear is that these polling errors could go in either direction. If it were to be Republicans who substantially outperform their polls, things could look very grim for Democrats indeed. The GOP would hold on to all their seats and would have a strong chance of defeating six Democratic incumbents\u2014perhaps even more. We'll find out soon enough.",
    " Title: Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort Resigns Amidst Controversy, Shakeup in Trump Campaign Leadership\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Donald Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has resigned from his position. This development comes as the Republican nominee's campaign faces a series of challenges, including poor polling numbers and self-inflicted controversies.\n\nManafort's resignation follows a string of unconventional moves by Trump, who, in a tightly scripted speech at a rally in North Carolina, admitted regretting some of his intemperate remarks made during the campaign. The resignation also coincides with the appointment of Steve Bannon, formerly of Breitbart, as the new campaign leadership.\n\nThe news of Manafort's resignation reportedly took some within the campaign by surprise, following a series of denials that a shakeup was underway. Sources familiar with the campaign have stated that Manafort had difficulty communicating with Trump in the same way that his predecessor, Corey Lewandowski, did.\n\nTrump's son, Eric, suggested in an interview with Fox News that the controversy over Manafort's ties to Russia and a report this week that he potentially evaded the reporting requirements of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) led to his departure.\n\nManafort, a veteran political strategist, has been under scrutiny due to his role in advising foreign politicians, including Ukrainian strongman Viktor Yanukovych. His close connections to Russia, at a time when Trump is trying to criticize Clinton for taking money from foreign donors for her family foundation, have been a growing problem.\n\nManafort joined the campaign as an unpaid adviser in March, after Trump had been repeatedly outmaneuvered in the delegation selection process by rival Ted Cruz. He soon used that foothold to expand his mandate, eventually replacing Lewandowski, who was disdained by many within the party establishment as well as the Trump family.\n\nIn a statement issued on Friday, Trump suggested Manafort's role had peaked as an adviser during the Republican national convention in Cleveland. However, the resignation, which contradicts claims Manafort would stay on earlier in the week, is the second time Trump has exercised his famous slogan \"you're fired\" \u2013 following the ousting of Lewandowski in June.\n\nLewandowski is now thought likely to make a comeback within the constantly shifting Trump inner circle, as he favors the same approach of \"letting Trump be Trump\" as Bannon is believed to.\n\nThe Trump campaign's shakeup and the apologetic address on Thursday night have been met with skepticism by Democrats, who have rejected the notion of a new-look Trump. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon stated, \"In case you thought for a split second Trump was genuine about feeling regret, he is back to demonizing immigrants again in his new ad today.\"",
    " Title: Liberal Perception of Donald Trump and His Supporters: A Focus on Racism, Islamophobia, and Xenophobia\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent article by Zack Beauchamp in Vox suggests that the electoral success of right-wing movements, including the rise of Donald Trump and the outcome of the Brexit referendum, is not primarily driven by economic anxiety but rather by \"racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia.\" This perspective, according to the article, is shared by a significant number of liberals.\n\nBeauchamp's article, which cites several academic studies, argues that the rise of right-wing nationalism cannot be explained solely in economic terms. However, the validity of this assertion, and the complete absence of economic factors in the rise of right-wing movements, is a matter of debate.\n\nThe article, and similar perspectives among liberals, have been criticized for displaying contempt for \"particularistic instincts\" that are not considered beyond the pale. These instincts, which include national, linguistic, religious, territorial, or ethnic attachments, are seen as natural to human beings and even coeval with political life.\n\nThe liberal view, as presented in the article, portrays supporters of right-wing movements as motivated by bigotry, fear, and selfishness, with a disregard for the rights and well-being of others. This perspective, critics argue, overlooks the legitimate concerns of these individuals, such as immigration, cultural preservation, and national sovereignty.\n\nThe article also suggests that this liberal denigration of the new nationalism is rooted in a desire to delegitimize any particularistic attachment or form of solidarity. This perspective, according to the article, presumes that all particularistic forms of solidarity must be superseded by a love of humanity in general, and that these particularistic attachments will be superseded by humanitarianism before long, as part of the inevitable unfolding of human progress.\n\nHowever, critics argue that this perspective overlooks the historical and cultural context of these particularistic attachments, and the role they play in shaping individual and collective identities. They also argue that the humanitarian ideal, while laudable, may not be universally applicable or desirable, and that it is important to respect and understand the diverse perspectives and attachments that exist within society.\n\nIn conclusion, the article by Zack Beauchamp in Vox, and the broader perspective it represents, suggests that supporters of right-wing movements are primarily motivated by racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. This perspective, while based on academic studies, has been criticized for displaying contempt for particularistic instincts and for oversimplifying the complex motivations of individuals who support right-wing movements. The debate over the causes of the rise of right-wing movements, and the appropriate response to them, is ongoing.",
    " Title: Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. Demands Arrest of Reporters Over COVID-19 Coverage\n\nArticle:\n\nJerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, has long advocated for free expression and intellectual diversity on college campuses. In a statement last June, Falwell emphasized the importance of open political discourse and encouraged colleges to promote such discourse on their campuses, as they do at Liberty University.\n\nHowever, Falwell is now demanding the arrest of two reporters he accuses of portraying his school in a negative light during the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interview with radio host Todd Starnes, Falwell criticized articles by The New York Times and ProPublica for their coverage of his decision to partially reopen Liberty University amid the outbreak.\n\nFalwell specifically took issue with a piece by New York Times journalist Elizabeth Williamson, who wrote about a conversation with local physician Thomas W. Eppes, Jr. Williamson reported that Eppes told her \"nearly a dozen Liberty students were sick with symptoms that suggested Covid-19.\" Falwell claimed that the number of presumptive cases never reached 12, characterizing the report as \"sensational click-bait.\"\n\nAs a result, Falwell secured arrest warrants for Times photographer Julia Rendleman and ProPublica reporter Alec MacGillis for trespassing, a Class 1 misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. Falwell also stated that an additional warrant is coming against someone affiliated with another \"big time liberal news organization.\" However, there is no warrant against Williamson because she did not take any photographs, so there is no physical proof that she was on campus. Falwell also threatened to sue The New York Times if a retraction or Liberty-friendly correction is not issued regarding the contagion numbers.\n\nAri Cohn, a free speech lawyer and former director at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), commented on the situation, stating, \"It is clear that Falwell is engaged in a campaign of petty retribution against journalists who write articles critical of the university.\" Cohn added, \"But that's actually completely in line with Liberty University's faux concern for freedom of expression. Falwell's idea of freedom of expression on campus includes only expression that he approves of.\"\n\nThe trespassing charges are unlikely to hold up in court, as the reporters were photographing a student who invited them to campus for an interview. However, the alleged trespassing is not the main concern here, according to Cohn. Instead, the concern is Falwell's attempt to intimidate people who criticize his school.\n\nCalum Best, the student interviewed by both The New York Times and ProPublica, described an angry phone call he received from Scott Lamb, the college's senior vice president for university communications, after he wrote a Facebook post arguing for tuition refunds amid COVID-19. Best wrote on Medium that he thought he was in trouble for a professional failure, but as the call went on, he realized his work-study boss had no need to be on the call and had no connection to the matter at hand.\n\nThis heavy-handedness tracks with how Falwell and his associates oversee Liberty University's student paper, Champion. Will E. Young, the former editor-in-chief, wrote last year that Falwell actively interfered with Trump-critical coverage, at one point removing a student op-ed lamenting Trump's Access Hollywood tape. The author of that op-ed, Joel Schmieg, took to Facebook to air the grievance and was promptly contacted by a faculty adviser, who reprimanded him for doing so. Schmieg then resigned.\n\nAs a private institution, Liberty University can set its own rules of conduct. However, it is the height of hypocrisy to muzzle student speech while making a show of opposing censorship. Furthermore, the university president is not just dealing with a newspaper on its own turf; with these warrants, Falwell is leveraging state power to try to stop speech by private actors whose only connection to his school is to write about it. It is a bad approach for anyone to take, but especially someone who claims to support free expression and intellectual diversity.",
    " Title: Biden Campaign Intensifies Outreach to Latino Voters Ahead of 2020 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an effort to bolster support among Latino voters, the Biden campaign has launched a significant outreach initiative, hiring a number of Hispanic operatives, spending over $1 million on Spanish-language outreach, and signing one of the nation's top pollsters in the field, Latino Decisions.\n\nRecent general election polls show Biden with a lead nationwide and in many battleground states. He is already leading among Hispanic voters. If Biden can match Hillary Clinton's 2016 support and turnout levels among Latinos while continuing to perform well among black and white voters, he would effectively secure the crucial battlegrounds of Florida and Arizona, denying President Trump a second term.\n\nMatt Barreto, Latino Decisions co-founder and pollster who also worked for Clinton's campaign, stated, \"There's a huge opportunity.\" He added that Clinton's campaign \"did an okay job\" with Latino turnout and support levels.\n\nTrump's record on immigration, Puerto Rico, healthcare, coronavirus response, and foreign policy, as well as Democrats' lessons learned from Florida's last election, where failing to aggressively reach out to Latino voters cost them the governor's office and a U.S. Senate seat, are factors driving the increased focus on Latino voters.\n\nBiden's campaign plans to capitalize on the \"incredible anger\" among Puerto Rican voters in Florida over Trump's handling of Hurricane Maria in 2017 and increase support levels in border-state Arizona, where Latinos have been influenced by the immigrant rights movement, particularly younger Latinos, which is bad news for Donald Trump. Already, 2018 demonstrated that heightened Latino turnout can flip the state, and with continued investment in Latino outreach, 2020 could follow the same path as 2018.\n\nThe Biden campaign has already begun this outreach through Spanish-language TV ads running in Florida and Arizona since last month. The ads feature narrators with different accents to cater to the diverse Latino community in these states.\n\nJennifer Molina, Biden's Latino Media, stated, \"The Latino vote is critically important, which is why we're bringing on Latino Decisions to help us with our messaging and outreach in order to engage with Latino voters on why Joe Biden is the best choice for President.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign, in response, stated that the president's values are shared by Hispanic voters who are motivated by jobs, education, family, faith, and community values.\n\nBiden advisers and campaign insiders acknowledge that Biden has ground to make up with Hispanic voters if he wants to secure the election, but they attribute the heightened focus on Latinos to common-sense campaign strategy and improved campaign finances. The Biden campaign's continued embrace of digital campaigning amid the pandemic could have a beneficial effect when it comes to outreach, as Latino voters are disproportionately young and digitally connected.\n\nHowever, a recent Trump ad focusing on crime and underfunded police departments made an impression on Spanish-speaking voters in South Florida, according to a source familiar with a focus group conducted by Democrats. A Democrat familiar with the Biden campaign's research also noted that the campaign has some problem areas to address, especially in Miami-Dade County, Florida's largest county with the largest proportion of Hispanic voters, where Biden is lagging Clinton's 2016 totals.\n\nThe Biden campaign's Latino outreach will extend to other battlegrounds, where a Latino Decisions poll released Friday shows problems for Trump. Barreto stated, \"Beyond Arizona and Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania have large and growing Latino populations that could ultimately decide a very close election. Our research in these two states suggests over 70% of Latinos oppose Trump's divisive rhetoric and see Biden as fighting for Latinos.\"",
    " Title: U.S. and China Agree on Framework for Trade Talks, Tariffs on Hold\n\nArticle:\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced on Sunday that the U.S. will hold off from imposing tariffs on Chinese goods as both nations attempt to negotiate trade agreements. The administration had previously threatened tariffs of $50 billion to $150 billion on Chinese goods to deter intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. China countered with threats of tariffs on $50 billion worth of U.S. farm, chemical, and other exports.\n\nDuring high-level talks on Thursday and Friday, the U.S. and China agreed on a framework for reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China and addressing technology trade issues. Mnuchin stated that the two sides have agreed to put tariffs on hold while they work to execute the framework.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit with China totaled a record $375 billion in 2017, and the Trump administration had asked China to commit to reducing it by $200 billion by 2020. A joint U.S.-China statement released Saturday stated that \"China will significantly increase purchases of United States goods and services,\" but did not specify the amount or timeline of the increased purchases.\n\nMnuchin expects major purchases this year, particularly of U.S. agriculture and energy products. He stated that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will visit China with \"very hard commitments\" in agriculture, where the U.S. expects to see a \"very big increase \u2014 35-40 percent increases \u2014 in agriculture this year alone.\" In energy, Mnuchin expects doubling the energy purchases, with potential annual energy purchases of $50 to $60 billion over the next three to five years.\n\nMnuchin declined to confirm whether China had agreed to a specific commitment to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with the country by $200 billion. He stated that the specific targets are not publicly disclosed and go industry by industry.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that China has taken advantage of trade deals, and on the campaign trail, he said tariffs would be necessary in some cases to show that the U.S. is not playing games anymore. Economist Steve Moore, who is close to the Trump administration, stated that the teeter-totter nature of the China talks is quintessential Trump, offering that the latest turn is part of his negotiating tactics.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, one of the driving forces behind the intellectual property theft investigation that led Trump to threaten tariffs on $50 billion to $150 billion worth of Chinese goods, stated that the two sides have \"agreed on a framework to address the very serious issues raised\" in that probe. That includes putting the tariffs on hold, but keeping them in reserve if needed.\n\nLighthizer also downplayed the importance of China reducing trade barriers and increasing purchases of U.S. goods compared to ending practices that threaten the United States' ability to maintain its technological edge. \"Getting China to open its market to more U.S. exports is significant, but the far more important issues revolve around forced technology transfers, cyber theft, and the protection of our innovation,\" Lighthizer said.\n\nThe tech industry welcomes the trade war cease-fire as a good step that will shield consumers from higher costs, but China still needs to make changes to level the playing field for American firms, according to Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, a lobby group for Amazon, Google, and others.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated that it is up to Trump's team not to \"blow it\" with China. \"There is nothing wrong with these talks, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating,\" Schumer said. \"If President Xi is going to escape meaningful punishment for ZTE and fail to take strong actions on intellectual property, cyber theft, and American companies having free access to sell goods in China, and instead simply provide a promise to buy goods for the next few years, we will have lost.\"\n\nSchumer was referring to the Chinese technology company ZTE, which faces stiff penalties for violating U.S. sanctions against North Korea and Iran. Trump stated last week that he would look into helping the company escape some of its harshest penalties. After talking with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump wrote on Twitter that he and Xi were working together to get ZTE back in business \"fast.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, stated that ZTE would not get off \"scot-free.\" Kudlow also stated that Trump has not completely abandoned the possibility of imposing tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing does not address U.S. concerns about intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. \"Look, I don't think we're at that stage yet... Our view is China must open up. They must become fair traders,\" Kudlow said.",
    " Title: Mayors of \"Sanctuary Cities\" Vow to Maintain Status, Potentially Clashing with Trump's Immigration Enforcement Push\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic mayors in cities across the United States, including Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, and Chicago, have reaffirmed their \"sanctuary\" status, potentially setting up a conflict with President-elect Donald Trump's immigration enforcement push. Trump's election has prompted city officials to affirm their commitment to providing safe havens for undocumented immigrants, defying Trump's campaign promises to penalize sanctuary cities by withholding federal funding.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago stated during a press conference, \"Chicago will always be a sanctuary city.\" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has gone as far as to say he would destroy a database of undocumented immigrants with city identification cards before handing it over to the Trump administration.\n\nIn sanctuary cities, local law enforcement officials are not required to contact U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) about the immigration status of individuals they encounter. This can mean that they do not notify the federal authorities when an undocumented immigrant is about to be released from custody, or when crime victims and witnesses might be less likely to cooperate with investigators if they are worried about being deported.\n\nTrump has stated his intention to deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants with a criminal history. He has also suggested creating a special deportation task force within ICE, but sanctuary city resistance could complicate their efforts.\n\nCritics of sanctuary cities argue that these policies harbor criminals and endanger public welfare. However, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck calls Trump's plan to deport illegal immigrants misguided and impractical. \"For a local law enforcement agency to take on [the] role of immigration enforcement tears that fabric apart,\" Beck said.\n\nBecause states and cities cannot be required to enforce federal law, and there is no U.S. requirement that police ask about a person's immigration status, one of the only options Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress have is to pull federal funding. During a September campaign stop in Phoenix, Trump stated, \"Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that for Congress to impose conditions on the receipt of federal money by the states, the conditions must be reasonably related to the purpose of the money. It remains unclear what specific funding Trump might actually pull from the cities.",
    " Title: Biden Supporters Urged to Take Tara Reade's Allegations Seriously Amidst Criticism of Trump's Handling of the Coronavirus Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political landscape in the United States is currently divided over the handling of the coronavirus crisis by President Donald Trump and the response to the sexual assault allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nCritics of Trump argue that his approach to the crisis varies depending on geographical locations with high and low coronavirus infection rates, with the latter often being areas that voted for him. Some believe that, given the country's historical tendency to rally around the leader during national crises, Trump's approval ratings should be higher than the current range of 45% to 50%.\n\nThe president's handling of the pandemic has been criticized for downplaying the severity of the pandemic, promoting dubious cures, and delaying testing and resource mobilization. These actions, which some experts consider the worst intelligence failure in U.S. history, have cost the opportunity to contain the pandemic.\n\nIn contrast, supporters of Biden argue that his long experience in government and his temperament would make him better equipped to handle an unprecedented crisis. However, the details of Biden's proposed response to the pandemic are not yet clear. His campaign has called for student loan forgiveness, a boost to Social Security benefits, fiscal transfers to state and local governments, more comprehensive action on paid sick leave, and additional checks to households beyond the $1,200 per person already enacted by Congress.\n\nRegarding the sexual assault allegation against Biden, both conservatives and liberals have been criticized for their responses. Conservatives have weaponized the allegations against Biden, while some liberals have been accused of turning a blind eye to the serious nature of the accusations.\n\nDuring the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, Biden publicly supported Christine Blasey Ford, emphasizing the importance of taking women's allegations seriously. He stated, \"For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she's talking about is real.\" This same presumption, some argue, should apply when the accused is a Democrat running for president.\n\nIn conclusion, the political landscape in the United States is currently marked by criticism of Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis and the serious sexual assault allegations against Biden. The response to these issues remains a topic of intense debate among Americans.",
    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie Joins GOP in Supporting 20-Week Abortion Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, has announced his support for a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, also known as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This stance places him in alignment with other potential Republican nominees for the 2016 presidential race.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Christie emphasized the bipartisan appeal of the proposed legislation, which aims to protect unborn children from 20 weeks, or five months, of pregnancy, based on their ability to feel pain. He stated, \"America is one of just seven countries that permit elective abortions past this point. We can do far better than this. I urge Congress to take swift action on this important issue.\"\n\nJoining Governor Christie in supporting the ban are several other likely Republican presidential candidates, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, ex-Texas Governor Rick Perry, ex-Florida Governor Jeb Bush, ex-Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, commented on the Republican unity around the push for the 20-week abortion ban. \"There is complete unity on the Republican side around this push,\" she said in a statement.\n\nIn contrast, the national Democratic Party and its leaders have consistently emphasized the role of the abortion lobby in their policy and politics, according to Ms. Dannenfelser. She expects this clear difference to be a significant focus of the general election debate.",
    " Title: White House Press Corps Skeptical of President Obama's Sequester-Related Warnings\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's apocalyptic predictions of the economic and personal consequences of the sequester spending cuts, set to take effect on March 1, are facing growing skepticism among an unexpected group: the White House press corps.\n\nOver the past week, Mr. Obama has issued a series of dire warnings about the potential impacts of allowing the so-called sequester to occur. However, reporters are increasingly questioning the motivation behind the President's messaging and are doubting whether the White House is orchestrating the Pentagon and other agencies to highlight potential cuts to boost public anxiety and pressure congressional Republicans to compromise.\n\nThe skepticism peaked on Friday when outgoing Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that the Transportation Department was planning on furloughing air-traffic controllers across the country, a move that would result in travel delays of up to 90 minutes at U.S. airports. Mr. LaHood faced sharp questioning over whether there weren't other, less disruptive cuts to be made.\n\n\"You've got a big budget. Can't you find some other way to cut that without telling air traffic controllers to stay home?\" ABC News' Jonathan Karl asked Mr. LaHood.\n\nMr. LaHood insisted agency officials were searching \"every contract\" to find the right places to cut, even as he emphasized the difficulty in dealing with angry travelers. \"Republicans need to step up here... This is not rocket science,\" he predicted.\n\nIn recent days, Mr. Obama has held public events highlighting potential painful cuts to emergency first-responders, and the Pentagon has warned of 800,000 civilian layoffs due to the sequester. The President will visit a shipbuilding yard in Newport News, Virginia on Tuesday to underscore more potential job losses and their impact on the local economy of the defense-heavy region.",
    " Title: Texas High School Shooting Leaves Ten Dead, 10 Injured\n\nArticle:\n\nA shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas has resulted in the deaths of ten individuals and left ten others injured, according to Texas Governor Greg Abbott. The attacker, identified as 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is a pupil at the school and has been charged with murder.\n\nAuthorities found various kinds of explosive devices at the school, including a CO2 device and a Molotov cocktail, according to Governor Abbott. Pagourtzis allegedly used a shotgun and a revolver taken from his father, who legally owned the weapons.\n\nPolice found information on the suspect's diary, computer, and mobile phone suggesting that he planned the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards. However, Governor Abbott stated that the teenager \"gave himself up\" because \"he did not have the courage to commit the suicide.\"\n\nSanta Fe Police Chief Jeff Powell advised residents to be aware of any suspicious objects they find. \"Do not touch any items that look out of place,\" he said. Santa Fe school police officer John Barnes has been named among the injured and is in a critical condition undergoing surgery, local media reported.\n\nThe shooting occurred on Friday, and one woman died and another was injured in a shooting outside a high school graduation ceremony in Atlanta the same day. So far this year, more than 5,000 people have died in shooting incidents in the United States, according to monitoring group the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nStudents reported that the shooter entered an art class and opened fire shortly before 08:00 (13:00 GMT). One witness told KTRK-TV, \"There was someone that walked in with a shotgun and started shooting,\" and \"this girl got shot in the leg.\"\n\nA teacher who realized what was happening activated a fire alarm to evacuate the building, and students ran outside when the alarms went off. President Donald Trump described the attack as \"absolutely horrific\" and ordered flags to be flown at half-mast at the White House and all public and military buildings.\n\nThe Texas attack is the deadliest school shooting since a student opened fire in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. That assault spawned a nationwide youth-led campaign for gun control, and a litany of proposed changes.\n\nAuthorities said journals kept by Pagourtzis showed that he planned to carry out the attack and intended to kill himself afterwards. However, unlike several previous mass shootings, authorities had not been alerted to Pagourtzis before the attack on Friday.",
    " Title: Koch's Legacy Under Scrutiny: Climate Change Resistance and Philanthropic Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nBillionaire libertarian David Koch, who passed away this week following a battle with prostate cancer, has faced criticism for his resistance to action on climate change. As the Arctic rapidly melted and the Amazon rainforest burned, the Earth experienced its hottest month in recorded history. This coincided with the warnings scientists issued 30 years ago about climate change, warnings that Koch worked to ensure the American public ignored.\n\nThroughout his career, Koch worked to remove from office any moderate Republicans who proposed regulating greenhouse gases. In 2009, for instance, Representative Bob Inglis of South Carolina proposed a carbon tax bill. Koch Industries, the company owned by the Koch brothers, stopped funding Inglis' campaign, donated heavily to a primary opponent named Trey Gowdy, and organized teams of Tea Party activists who protested against Inglis at town hall meetings.\n\nKoch Industries is considered one of the country's most highly polluting companies, behind only ExxonMobil and American Electric Power. In the 20 years to 2017, the Kochs donated approximately $127 million to 92 groups that opposed climate crisis solutions, according to Greenpeace.\n\nRecent months have seen a public spat between the Koch brothers and President Trump, with the Kochs criticizing Trump's trade tariffs and Trump labeling the billionaires as a \"total joke.\" However, Trump has adopted many of the right-wing positions the Kochs have long advocated, with the exception of trade policy, which is contrary to the free-market views of the Kochs.\n\nKoch's legacy is complex and filled with contradictions. He was a significant stakeholder in the second-largest privately held company in the country and had a net worth of around $50 billion. Despite his wealth, Koch was known for his philanthropic efforts, donating over $1 billion to causes such as the Smithsonian, Lincoln Center, and cancer research.\n\nKoch supported same-sex marriage and abortion rights, free trade, and humane immigration policies. He was an advocate for criminal justice and prison reform, and his philanthropy extended to various cultural and educational institutions in New York City.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Koch's political activities and philanthropy are now under scrutiny, with some arguing that there is enough evidence to support impeachment. The absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid does not necessarily weaken the case, as circumstantial evidence can be used to prove a criminal exchange. The focus of the investigation will be on the context and circumstances surrounding Koch's actions. Whether this evidence is enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Retired St. Louis Police Captain David Dorn Killed During Violent Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nST. LOUIS, Mo. (AP) \u2014 A retired police captain who died during a night of violent protests was trying to protect his friend's pawn shop, his widow said. David Dorn, a 77-year-old retired St. Louis police officer who served 38 years on the force, was shot and killed by looters at Lee's Pawn & Jewelry early Tuesday, June 2, 2020, police said. His body was found on the sidewalk at about 2:30 a.m.\n\nDorn's death came on a violent night in St. Louis, where four officers were shot, officers were pelted with rocks and fireworks, and 55 businesses were burglarized or damaged, including a convenience store that burned. Police also shot and gravely injured a burglary suspect who they say shot at officers.\n\nCities across the U.S. have seen protests and violence since George Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleading for air.\n\nDorn was a friend of the pawn shop's owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, his wife, St. Louis police Sgt. Ann Marie Dorn, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\nDavid Dorn served 38 years on the St. Louis police force before retiring in October 2007. He then became chief of Moline Acres, a small town in St. Louis County.\n\nFormer St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch knew Dorn for 30 years and said they became close friends when Dorn and his wife were leading the St. Louis police department's Explorers program for young people interested in law enforcement careers, while Fitch was leading the county's program.\n\n\"He was very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth,\" said Fitch, who led the St. Louis County Police Department from 2009 to 2014. \"He wanted to see them succeed. He wanted to be a role model for those young men and women to go into law enforcement.\"\n\nDorn's personality was \"bigger than life,\" Fitch said. \"He was a fun guy, a happy guy. You never had to wonder what he was thinking when somebody did something incredibly stupid like a crime because he would just say it as he saw it.\"\n\nWhen he took over as chief in Moline Acres, Dorn made it clear that his officers would be held to the strictest of standards, Fitch said.\n\n\"He wanted them to do the right thing all the time,\" Fitch said.\n\nThe Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in St. Louis, said in a news release that Dorn was \"the type of brother that would've given his life to save them if he had to.\"\n\nSt. Louis police Chief John Hayden called Dorn a \"fine captain.\"\n\n\"Many of us, the other officers, looked up to him,\" Hayden said. \"Was very well-liked, very pleasant. And his wife still works here. So a very sad time for our agency. We will honor him.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Lawmakers Pursue Systemic Racism Reforms Across Multiple States\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of nationwide protests against racial injustice, U.S. lawmakers are taking steps to address systemic racism in various aspects of public life. These efforts extend beyond policing reforms, prompting discussions that some believe the country has not previously engaged in due to discomfort.\n\nSydney Kamlager, a member of the Legislative Black Caucus in the California state Assembly, stated, \"If you're just talking about police and you're not looking at the rest of the spectrum, then you're really not focused on change.\"\n\nThe success of these reforms has been mixed. While California has celebrated recent legislative victories, lawmakers in New Hampshire refused to make an exception to their rules for a Democratic lawmaker who sought to introduce a bill examining racial bias and discrimination in the state's corrections, judicial, and police systems.\n\nIn California, a number of bills that have struggled to pass for years are suddenly gaining traction. Last week, the state Assembly overwhelmingly approved a bill that would allow voters to decide whether to overturn the state's 1996 ban on affirmative action in government and public colleges and universities. On Thursday, the state Senate passed a bill to make ethnic studies a graduation requirement in the California State University system, the country's largest four-year public university.\n\nIn other states, lawmakers are also addressing racial bias. In Pennsylvania, Democratic lawmakers are trying to capitalize on the moment to address racial bias in the judicial system. In Massachusetts, a Democratic lawmaker wants to overhaul state education spending to funnel more money to schools with high numbers of minority students. And in Ohio, separate resolutions would declare racism a public health crisis.\n\nCalifornia is considering studying how the state could offer reparations for slavery. A bill would establish an eight-member task force to study the effects of slavery and its \"legacy of structural discrimination.\" The committee would recommend how the state could compensate black people, which doesn't necessarily mean cash.\n\nOther states are coupling their coronavirus relief efforts with racial justice issues. In Pennsylvania, Democratic lawmakers have fused a police reform and racial justice agenda with a pandemic recovery platform under the banner of a \"just recovery.\" In Massachusetts, a priority will be finding an extra $1 billion over the next few years for struggling school systems, primarily in cities with high minority populations.\n\nOhio could go further by declaring racism a public health crisis. The Ohio Legislative Black Caucus has introduced resolutions in the House and Senate that would officially acknowledge racism in Ohio for the first time. They call for increased spending to address the effects of racism in education, housing, criminal justice, and health care. However, the House resolution, which is cosponsored entirely by Democrats, has yet to have a hearing in the Republican-controlled chamber.",
    " Title: Majority of Republicans and GOP-leaning Independents Urge Cruz and Kasich to Withdraw from Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CNN/ORC poll indicates that a majority of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents believe Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich should withdraw from the presidential race, as neither candidate can mathematically secure a majority of GOP delegates through the primary and caucus process alone.\n\nThe poll, released Monday, shows that 52% of respondents think Sen. Cruz should drop out, while 63% believe Gov. Kasich should exit the race. The questions were preceded by statements indicating that neither candidate can win a majority of delegates through the primary and caucus process at this point and could potentially win the nomination if no candidate reaches a majority.\n\nBoth Cruz and Kasich have argued that no candidate will win the 1,237 majority of delegates before the GOP convention in July, although Republican front-runner Donald Trump still has a viable path to that threshold.\n\nThe latest delegate tally, reported by The Associated Press, shows Trump with 996 delegates, Cruz with 565, and Kasich with 153. In terms of delegates, Kasich is also still behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who left the race a month and a half ago. A separate poll released this week found that 58% of GOP voters in Ohio think Gov. Kasich should end his White House run.\n\nThe poll also revealed that a greater percentage of Republicans and leaners believe the party will still be divided in November, compared to March. Forty-nine percent of respondents said the party will still be divided in November, 41% said the party is divided now but will be united, and 7% said the party is currently united. In March, 46% said they thought the GOP would be divided in November, 45% said they thought the party is divided but will be united for the general election, and 8% said they thought the party was already united.",

The Mason-Dixon Polling & Research survey, shared exclusively with POLITICO, was conducted among 400 registered Republican voters from Tuesday to Thursday.\n\nRubio received 31 percent support from Republicans, essentially tying Bush's 30 percent. Other likely and announced presidential candidates polled in the single digits, and 17 percent were undecided.\n\nThe poll's results are statistically insignificant due to the margin of error. However, the poll provides insight into the current state of the Republican primary race in Florida.\n\nOne of the primary concerns for Rubio before announcing his presidential bid was securing enough donors and supporters to secure his home state, given the presence of establishment figure Jeb Bush. The poll suggests that Rubio may have successfully addressed this concern.\n\nUpon announcing his presidential bid, Rubio stated, \"I've heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn. But I can not. Because I believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake, and I can make a difference as president.\"\n\nThe poll's results may indicate that the state of Florida is up for grabs in the Republican primary race. The poll's findings might be surprising to Bush's campaign team and other observers of the race.",
    " Title: New York Times' 'The Interpreter' Blog and Newsletter Focuses More on Far-Right Politics and Movements\n\nThe New York Times' 'The Interpreter' blog and newsletter, which explores the ideas and context behind major world events, has a higher likelihood of reporting on far-right politicians and movements compared to far-left ones, according to an analysis. The blog is penned by Max Fisher and Amanda Taub, who are alumni of the left-leaning explainer site Vox.\n\nThe analysis, which examined more than 50 stories mentioning the political \"right\" or \"left\" around the globe written by Fisher and Taub for the blog since its inception in 2016, found a stark emphasis on coverage of the political right. The articles made 136 mentions of the \"far right\" but just one mention of the \"far left,\" and 60 mentions of \"right-wing\" politicians or movements compared to 10 mentions of \"left-wing\" politicians or movements.\n\nThirty-two of their stories overall mentioned the \"far right\" and 31 mentioned \"right-wing\" movements or politicians, while one story mentioned the \"far left\" and seven mentioned \"left-wing\" movements or politicians. In a lengthy article headlined \"How YouTube Radicalized Brazil,\" which appeared on Tuesday's front page, Fisher and Taub used the phrases \"far right\" and \"right-wing\" 15 times. It described President Jair Bolsonaro as a \"star in YouTube's far-right community\" before becoming president last year.\n\nA piece by Taub headlined \"Why Democracy Feels Like a Dangerous Game\" on Dec. 1, 2017, mentioned the \"far right\" 12 times alone. The analysis, however, noted that the reporting is not always consistent in its political labeling. For instance, a report on corruption scandals embroiling former left-wing presidents Dilma Rousseff of Brazil and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner of Argentina did not provide a label for either of them, while this 2017 Interpreter story mentioned Rousseff's \"left-wing party.\"\n\nFurthermore, stories about Venezuela omitted the \"far left\" label to describe the failed socialist government there under Nicolas Maduro. A 2017 article on the rise of authoritarianism referred to Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez as championing \"leftist populism.\" Another Interpreter story later that year mentioned the government's socialist bent but also omitted any \"left\" label.\n\nA May 14, 2017, piece specifically analyzing Venezuela's economic collapse did not use the word \"socialism\" or \"socialist\" once. It did report on the \"leftist\" Chavez's rise to power, increased nationalization of the economy, and cronyism that eventually crippled the nation.\n\nThe New York Times overall is more likely to use the labels \"far-right\" and \"right-wing\" than \"far-left\" and \"left-wing\" in its reporting, a search shows. A search of the Times archives showed far fewer stories involving the terms \"far-left\" (5,259) and \"left-wing\" (40,972) than \"far right\" (11,868) and \"right-wing\" (51,168). The same also goes for the terms \"hard left\" (1,332) versus \"hard right\" (3,389) and \"extreme left\" (5,829) versus \"extreme right\" (6,902). The terms \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" can often be employed in nonpolitical contexts, so they were omitted.",
    " Title: Congress Faces Potential Government Shutdown, but Avoidance Likely, Says GOP Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States federal government is facing the possibility of a shutdown next week, with the government having previously experienced shutdowns in 1995 and 1996. However, recent statements from Republican leaders on Capitol Hill suggest that a shutdown may not occur, at least not next week.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told CNN that he is not willing to risk a shutdown and have Republicans take the blame for it. Many Republicans fear they will be blamed for a shutdown, just months before a significant congressional election year. A CNN/ORC poll in mid-September showed that 51% of people would hold Republicans in Congress responsible for a shutdown, versus 40% for President Barack Obama.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) might already be in this camp. He initially proposed a spending bill that would have avoided a standoff, but conservatives forced him to go to war with a different version fully defunding Obamacare. Boehner's opening move was an important signal that he wants to sidestep a shutdown.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Arizona) also expressed concern about the potential consequences of a shutdown, referring to the sting Republicans felt after the shutdowns in 1995 and 1996.\n\nCongress operates on political currency, and multiple House GOP aides told CNN that the majority of Republicans in their conference fear a shutdown would cost them with voters.\n\nRepublicans are divided over how far to take the Obamacare battle at the moment. GOP leaders are also preparing a second Obamacare fight during the upcoming debt ceiling debate. They have the option of dropping the anti-Obamacare push from the shutdown debate now and instead including it in the debt ceiling fight coming up.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are eager to move past the shutdown debate and on to the debt ceiling and budget cuts slated to hit in January at the latest.\n\nFacebook users mentioned \"Obamacare\" 300,000 times in the U.S. and 360,000 times globally, according to data from the site.\n\nIf a shutdown does occur, it will likely happen in the day or two before the potential shutdown, as political pressure against a shutdown builds. Workers may be sent home without pay, troops' paychecks may be delayed, families may cancel vacations, and incredible political pressure against a shutdown will build.\n\nThe government does not necessarily have to shut down at the end of the day on September 30. If lawmakers are close to a deal, the president can order agencies to keep running for a few hours or perhaps even a day or two for Congress to pass the legislation.\n\nIn conclusion, the shutdown deadline is not as firm as people might think, and Congress operates best on deadlines. However, the swirling, unpredictable dynamics in Congress at the moment and Republicans' gut-level objections to Obamacare make it unclear whether a shutdown will occur. If a shutdown does happen, it will likely be the result of a late game of chicken between the House, Senate, and president.",
    " Title: Media Panel Discusses Allegations Against Joe Biden and Comparisons to Brett Kavanaugh\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a segment of NBC's Meet the Press, political analysts discussed the calls for an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden regarding an allegation of rape. The discussion, led by NBC political director Chuck Todd, featured Cook Political Report's Amy Walter and NBC Capitol Hill correspondent Kasie Hunt.\n\nTodd read a portion of a column written by The New York Times editorial board, expressing dissatisfaction with Biden's denials made on MSNBC's Morning Joe late last week. The Times suggested that any investigation should be limited to information about the accuser and conducted by an unbiased, apolitical panel put together by the Democratic National Committee (DNC).\n\nTodd questioned the extent of the Democratic Party's willingness to conduct such an investigation, as if it were a serious proposition. Hunt expressed concern that Republicans were focusing on the handling of Brett Kavanaugh's allegations and the media's coverage of him, rather than Donald Trump.\n\nHunt noted the discrepancy in the media's coverage of sexual misconduct allegations, particularly in favor of Democrats. She argued that the debate about Biden's alleged conduct had become \"very muddled and devolved into lobbing charges back and forth.\"\n\nHunt attributed the lack of appetite for investigating Biden to fears of a 2016 repeat, referring to the email controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton. On the other hand, Walter criticized The Times' suggestion of the DNC putting together an unbiased panel to investigate Biden, stating that it was \"stretching it.\"\n\nWalter also discussed the perceived hypocrisy in the coverage of Biden and Brett Kavanaugh, with many people believing there was a partisan bias in the media's handling of the allegations. The segment ended with the panelists acknowledging the complexity and sensitivity of the issue, with Todd stating that \"every social media debate devolves into, is some sort of whataboutism on those two gentlemen.\"",

This proposal, initially perceived as a gaffe, is being considered as a potential solution to the Syria crisis.\n\nDuring a news conference in London, Kerry suggested that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad could avoid a U.S.-led strike by turning over all his chemical weapons to the international community within a week. However, the State Department later clarified Kerry's remarks as \"rhetorical\" and made it clear that the administration's desire to strike could be tempered by a Syrian offer.\n\nThe State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, explained that Kerry's point was that Assad, with a history of playing fast and loose with facts, cannot be trusted to turn over chemical weapons. A State Department spokesman also described Kerry's remark as \"hypothetical,\" dismissing Russia's eagerness over the proposal as a \"stalling tactic.\"\n\nThe potential outcome of this proposal would involve the confiscation of dangerous weapons from the Syrian regime, the U.S. claiming that its \"pressure\" led to this concession, avoiding an unwanted intervention, and resolving the \"red line\" conundrum. With the Senate debating an authorization of force resolution and widespread public opposition to a Syria intervention, the administration may be seizing this opportunity to extricate President Obama from his self-inflicted \"red line\" predicament.\n\nHowever, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stated that Congress should still vote to authorize a military strike on Syria, claiming that the only reason this proposal is on the table is because of the threat of military action. The White House's stance on the matter remains unclear, with the president scheduled to attend a Senate GOP lunch on Tuesday.\n\nIn the midst of this evolving situation, it appears that the administration is still committed to having these votes, and the president's advisers fear that Syria threatens to undercut his standing with the public and erode his political capital on other matters. The White House's response to this proposal and its impact on the Syria crisis continues to develop.",
    " Title: Obama Adopts Aggressive Strategy in Second Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the second presidential debate, President Barack Obama employed a strategy he has used effectively on the campaign trail, known as the \"power of nope.\" The phrase \"not true\" was a frequent response from the president as he refuted numerous claims made by Mitt Romney. This approach, which was not used in the first debate, was signaled by the campaign as a more aggressive stance for Obama.\n\nThe 90-minute debate saw both candidates pacing, engaging, and frequently interrupting the moderator to finish their points. At one point, Obama sought the moderator's support after she corrected Romney's statement regarding the president's characterization of the Libya consulate attack.\n\nMitt Romney responded in kind, engaging in debates with the moderator and Obama about the ground rules and challenging the president on facts. However, Romney's demeanor was similar to that of the first debate, while Obama's was more assertive, aiming to revive his poll numbers following their initial debate.\n\nThe candidates frequently interrupted each other, leading to a more heated exchange compared to the first round. One notable moment occurred when Romney questioned Obama's pension, to which Obama quipped, \"I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours.\"\n\nThe debate also revisited familiar topics such as taxes and the budget, with both candidates reiterating their respective positions. Romney proposed lowering tax rates across the board while ensuring the top 5 percent do not pay less than they currently do. Obama countered that Romney's tax cut plan would either increase the deficit or lead to a middle-class tax hike.\n\nThe town-hall-style format allowed for a discussion on a range of foreign and domestic issues, with the final presidential debate scheduled for October 22 in Boca Raton, Florida, focusing on foreign policy. The vice presidential debate last week saw Vice President Biden taking a more aggressive approach, similar to Obama's in the second presidential debate. However, Biden also faced criticism for his demeanor, laughing at and interrupting Republican opponent Paul Ryan throughout the debate.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Rules Against Compulsory Union Dues for Public Sector Employees\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 5-4 decision on Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that public sector unions do not have the constitutional right to collect compulsory dues from employees. The ruling, in the case of Janus v. AFSCME, means that employees will now have to give explicit consent before any money from their paychecks goes to support a public-sector union. This ruling does not apply to unions at private companies.\n\nMark Janus, a child support specialist at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, was a non-member of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union, yet he was still required to pay \"fair share\" dues to the union. Janus argued that being forced to pay dues to a politically active union, in return for employment, violates his First Amendment rights.\n\nFederal law prevents unions from requiring employees to join a union as a condition of their employment. However, unions argue that since their collective bargaining benefits all employees, all employees should be required to pay into the union. These \"fair share\" fees or \"agency fees\" are intended to cover only collective bargaining and contract negotiation, and not political activism. Unions claim that these fees also help pay for representation if a worker is being mistreated by an employer.\n\nUnions argue that removing these fees or making them voluntary would substantially weaken their ability to perform even basic functions. However, Janus argued that having to donate any money to a politically active union violates his rights.\n\nIn the opinion of the court, Justice Samuel Alito stated that the justices had concluded that the act of taking union dues from employees who chose not to join a union \"violates the free speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern.\"\n\nJustice Alito's opinion was joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Neil Ginsburg. The dissent was written by Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer. The vote took place largely along ideological lines, with Justice Kennedy, often considered the swing vote, siding with the more conservative justices.",
    " Title: Uninsured Rate Among U.S. Adults Hits Lowest Point Since 2008, According to Gallup Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent poll by Gallup indicates that nearly nine out of ten Americans now have health insurance, marking a significant improvement from two years ago before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The uninsured rate among U.S. adults declined to 11.9% in the first quarter of 2015, down one percentage point from the end of 2014 and a notable improvement from the 18% without insurance in the fall of 2013, when Americans were first able to sign up for coverage at state and federal exchanges.\n\nThis is the lowest percentage of Americans without coverage since Gallup began tracking the figure in 2008. In 2008, the uninsured rate was just under 15%. The law requiring most Americans to have coverage or pay a penalty took effect at the start of 2014.\n\nAccording to the Gallup report, an improving economy and a falling unemployment rate may have contributed to the steep drop in the percentage of uninsured over the past year. However, the uninsured rate is significantly lower than it was in early 2008, before the depths of the economic recession, suggesting that the recent decline is due to more than just an improving economy.\n\nThose making less than $36,000 a year have seen the most significant rate of improvement. Though 22% of this income group still do not have coverage, that's down from 30.7% at the end of 2013.\n\nThose aged 26 to 34 have also seen the most improvement of any age group, but more than 20% still lack coverage. About 98% of those aged 65 and older have coverage, a figure that remains unchanged from two years ago, as almost all of them qualify for Medicare.\n\nFurthermore, far more minority adults still are without coverage, as about 13% of blacks and 30% of Hispanics do not have coverage. However, they have seen greater improvement in their rates of coverage than have whites.",
    " Title: FDA Voluntary Guidelines on Antibiotic Use in Farm Animals Met with Skepticism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in October that antibiotic-resistant bacteria, known as \"superbugs,\" cause at least two million infections and 23,000 deaths in the United States annually. The cost to the U.S. health care system has been estimated at $17 billion to $26 billion per year.\n\nIn response, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued voluntary guidelines aimed at curbing the misuse of antibiotics in animals. However, these guidelines have been met with skepticism due to their voluntary nature and the potential for loopholes.\n\nThe FDA's guidelines ask industry not to use antibiotics for growth promotion but permit use of antibiotics for routine disease prevention with a veterinary prescription. This leaves producers with a loophole to continue using antibiotics for growth promotion by simply calling it another name. The guidelines also provide a disincentive to clean up their facilities, as the industry can use the simplest, cheapest, and most dangerous method to keep livestock healthy: antibiotics.\n\nThe FDA's guidelines have been criticized for not going far enough in restricting antibiotic use in farm animals. The agency argues that veterinarians will ensure responsible use, but most livestock and poultry are overseen by veterinarians employed by companies that have spent years fighting regulation.\n\nThe FDA's guidelines have been met with opposition from the drug industry, which stands to lose millions of dollars in sales if antibiotics are no longer used routinely for disease prevention. The chief executive of the largest animal drug company stated that the guidelines \"will not have a significant impact on our revenues.\"\n\nThe Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA), a bill that would save eight classes of antibiotics for use on humans and sick animals, has been the subject of frequent industry attacks. Out of 225 lobbying reports filed in the 112th Congress on PAMTA, 195 reports (87.5%) were submitted on behalf of entities hostile to the legislation. Medical and consumer advocacy groups filed only 30 of the 225 reports (12.5%).\n\nWith millions of infections and thousands of deaths linked to antibiotic resistance, it is clear that meaningful action is needed. The World Health Organization has warned that antibiotic resistance could mean \"an end to modern medicine as we know it.\" It is time for Congress to take meaningful action to regulate the use of antibiotics in farm animals and step up to the plate.",
    " Title: Trump Replaces Campaign Manager as He Trails Biden in Polls\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has demoted his longtime campaign manager, Brad Parscale, and replaced him with Bill Stepien, according to a Facebook post by Trump. The move comes as Trump trails Democratic candidate Joe Biden in opinion polls less than four months before the November 3 vote.\n\nAs of Thursday night, Biden is ahead of Trump nationally by an average of 8.6%, according to RealClearPolitics. Many political analysts agree that Biden is a stronger opponent than Hillary Clinton was in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, more voters trusted Trump, with just 37% of those polled by Quinnipiac saying they believed Clinton to be more honest. Today, Biden leads Trump by 15 points on the question of whether voters believe the candidates to be honest.\n\nTrump was on pace for a close reelection just five months ago, but a massive factor in his poor performance is beyond his control. Voters' loathing of Clinton played an enormous role in 2016. However, Biden does not inspire the same level of negative reaction.\n\nPolls consistently show that Trump's supporters are more excited to vote for him than Biden's supporters are to vote for him. While Biden voters may not be all that excited about voting for Biden, they are very enthusiastic about voting against Trump. This gives Biden a strong edge, as Trump supporters do not despise Biden the way they despised Clinton in 2016.\n\nRegistered voters with negative opinions of both Trump and Biden preferred Biden to Trump by a whopping 23-point margin in the polling Nationscape conducted in June. They also rated Biden less negatively overall, with only 33% of this group saying they had a very unfavorable opinion of Biden compared to 62% who said the same of Trump.\n\nThese results, especially when combined with recent political science research on the power of negative partisanship, suggest that the public's stronger dislike of Trump is probably the more consequential enthusiasm gap in 2020.",
    " Title: Federal Aid and State Budgets: A Look at the Fiscal Impact of COVID-19\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Congress considers further coronavirus aid, concerns have been raised that states may use federal funds to address pre-pandemic budgetary issues. In late April, President Donald Trump tweeted, \"Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois, for example) and cities, in all cases Democrat run and managed, when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help? I am open to discussing anything, but just asking?\"\n\nHowever, Christopher Mooney, a professor of state politics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, argues that this characterization does not necessarily equate to \"blue state bailouts.\" The response to COVID-19 has created a genuine fiscal emergency, and while many states with deep pension debts lean left, this does not automatically imply that additional aid would primarily benefit Democratic states.\n\nData from the Rockefeller Institute of Government in New York shows that Democratic states such as New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut pay the federal government far more than they receive each year. Conversely, some deep-red states like Alabama and Mississippi receive much more than they contribute. These imbalances are largely due to demographics, as America's progressive tax system means that residents in wealthy states (often heavily urban and Democratic-controlled) pay higher federal taxes than those in other states. Urban-oriented states usually have high demands for public services, leading to relatively high spending by state and local governments, according to Professor Mooney.\n\nIn essence, ideology may guide decisions, but demographics are the primary factor. When it comes to how states are managed, Professor Mooney notes that this is often a matter of opinion. He states, \"When you start throwing out words like 'well run' or 'poorly run,' unless you have very specific criteria in mind... it's subjective by definition.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the ongoing debate surrounding federal aid and state budgets is complex and multifaceted. While ideological leanings may influence the discussion, demographic factors play a significant role in determining the fiscal health of states and their reliance on federal aid. The management of states and cities is a matter of opinion, and specific criteria are necessary to objectively evaluate their performance.",
    " Title: Challenges Facing Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton in Upcoming Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming 2016 presidential election is anticipated to feature a match-up between former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Both candidates are well-known, well-funded, and have a wide network of supporters. However, their entry into the race has sparked questions from some about the viability of other candidates.\n\nJeb Bush and Hillary Clinton share similar strengths and weaknesses. Both have been able to raise significant funds, have the support of their party's establishment, and have been favorably portrayed by the media. They were expected to secure their party's nomination early, but grass-roots voters from both parties have expressed a desire for new faces and new ideas.\n\nBoth candidates also carry significant baggage. Their long political careers have led to perceptions of being part of political dynasties, which is not appealing to many voters. Both have faced subtle snubs from their parties' previous nominees. For instance, Hillary Clinton served as President Obama's Secretary of State, but Obama and his associates have been less than complimentary in their references to her. It has been reported that Obama confidant Valerie Jarrett may have leaked news of Clinton's private email accounts to the media. Similarly, Jeb Bush's fundraisers faced resistance from 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who hinted at running himself.\n\nHillary Clinton's image as an establishment, slightly left-of-center Democratic moderate has hurt her as the base of her party has shifted to the left. Her attempts to emulate populism have been met with skepticism. Jeb Bush, on the other hand, has faced criticism for emphasizing issues that are seen as suspect by the current GOP base. His response has been as ham-handed as Hillary's among Democrats.\n\nWhile the \"common wisdom\" of the moment may suggest a Clinton-Bush match-up, it is not guaranteed. Both candidates face challenges in winning over their respective bases and may not live up to the expectations set by the \"common wisdom.\"",
    " Title: Navigating Political Conversations During Holiday Gatherings: NPR Readers Share Their Experiences\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, families across the United States are preparing for gatherings that may include heated political discussions. National Public Radio (NPR) asked its listeners for their best and worst experiences talking politics over Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nMany of the stories received were not heartwarming, with incidents ranging from religious disagreements to racist epithets. However, some respondents reported that discussing politics could help clear the air and improve family dynamics.\n\nAaron Harmon shared his experience of his father-in-law insisting that he, an atheist, say grace at the table, which led to a heated argument about his religious beliefs and eventual shouting match between family members.\n\nStephanie Brown recounted a Thanksgiving dinner that started as a discussion about missing church, escalated into a political debate, and ended in a series of emotional attacks. However, the incident led to a family conversation about unresolved anger and the realization that the fight was not about the 2012 election results but rather long-standing family issues.\n\nJeremy Brown shared a particularly distressing experience of racist remarks and derogatory language during a Thanksgiving dinner, which led him to decide never to return for another holiday gathering.\n\nTo avoid political discussions, some families have implemented creative solutions, such as Sally Carleton's \"duck quacker\" that interrupts conversations about politics and religion. NPR's Sarah McCammon suggests focusing on food, children, and pets as topics of conversation to keep the peace.\n\nLuke Aldridge emphasizes the importance of humility and respect in political discussions, while Danielle Kurtzleben suggests making controversial food choices to spark conversation and distract from political disagreements.\n\nNPR's Brad Heil shared his mother's rule of sitting on the back porch during political discussions if one is unable to respect other parties' opinions. Finally, NPR offers its own solution to informed political discussions through its Politics section and new podcast.\n\nIn conclusion, while political discussions can be a source of tension during holiday gatherings, there are various strategies to navigate these conversations and maintain family harmony.",
    " Title: Rare Defeat of a Republican Incumbent Senator: A Look at Historical Precedents\n\nArticle:\n\nLiz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, has officially ended her challenge to veteran Sen. Mike Enzi in the Wyoming Republican Senate primary. Cheney cited family illness as the primary reason for her decision. However, historically, Republicans do not typically oust their incumbent U.S. senators.\n\nSince World War II, approximately 11 Republican senators have lost their party primaries, while Democratic senators have been defeated by their own party more than three times that number. These defeats often involve southern Democrats who lost in primaries that were effectively elections, as well as Democrats who did not align with the increasingly left-of-center leanings of party activists.\n\nExamples of defeated Republican incumbents include Wisconsin's Sen. Robert La Follette Jr., who lost renomination in 1946 to a young Marine Corps veteran named Joe McCarthy. McCarthy ran as an internationalist and backer of the United Nations, criticizing La Follette's isolationist record. In contrast, McCarthy's reputation as a fervent and controversial anti-Communist would come later.\n\nIn 1968, California's Max Rafferty, a swashbuckling Superintendent of Public Instruction, defeated Senate GOP Whip and moderate Tom Kuchel. Rafferty, who went on to lose against Democrat Alan Cranston, ran as a conservative in contrast with a more moderate incumbent.\n\nNew York's Alfonse D'Amato beat veteran GOP Sen. Jacob Javits in New York's primary in 1980 and won in November, two years after conservative activist Jeff Bell defeated moderate Sen. Clifford Case in New Jersey. Bell, however, lost in November.\n\nIn 2010, constitutional lawyer and stalwart conservative Mike Lee won a convention battle over three-term Republican Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah, and serves in the Senate today. That same year, conservative Joe Miller ousted the more moderate Sen. Lisa Murkowski in Alaska's Republican primary, but she came back to be re-elected as a write-in candidate.\n\nDespite the successes of D'Amato and Lee, there are numerous examples of conservative challengers who could not make a strong enough case to unseat an incumbent senator. In Connecticut, Prescott Bush Jr., brother of then-Vice President George Bush, quit a 1982 challenge to Sen. Lowell P. Weicker, an outspoken liberal Republican. Two years later, conservative Rep. Tom Corcoran lost in the Illinois Republican primary to moderate Sen. Charles Percy. In 2010, former Rep. J.D. Hayworth could not make a case to Arizona Republicans that Sen. John McCain was not conservative enough. McCain won handily.\n\nMost state and national Republican leaders are expected to breathe a sigh of relief at the news about the Wyoming race. Despite Dick Cheney's revered status in Wyoming, most of his fellow GOP activists ignored his daughter and sided with three-termer Enzi. They saw no difference between the two conservatives on any issue other than Liz Cheney wanted to be a senator.\n\nLiz Cheney clearly had problems going into the race, notably her long-time residence in Northern Virginia before becoming a candidate. She has personal reasons for ending her candidacy on Monday. However, she also had history against her.",
    " Title: Analysis of Hillary Clinton's Potential 2016 Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe article discusses the potential 2016 presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, former First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State. The piece suggests that while Clinton is a well-known figure in American politics, her candidacy is not universally supported, with some Democrats viewing her as their only viable option, while Republicans see her as a formidable opponent.\n\nThe article highlights Clinton's political experience, her ability to discuss policy, and her status as a woman, which could potentially help her with female voters. However, it also mentions that she has carried baggage from her husband's presidency and may face criticism for her role in President Barack Obama's administration.\n\nThe article also touches upon Clinton's public speaking style, which is described as stiff and wooden, and her perceived lack of political instinct. The piece suggests that Clinton's ambition, while strong, may not be matched by the \"fire in the belly\" that drives successful politicians.\n\nThe article further discusses the challenges Clinton might face in a 2016 campaign, such as increased scrutiny from the press and the need to defend her record. It also mentions the potential financial implications of a campaign, comparing the lifestyle of a candidate to that of a wealthy, retired individual.\n\nThe article concludes by suggesting that Clinton's ambition may be driving her towards a 2016 campaign, but she may face significant challenges, including a lack of enthusiasm from some voters and financial difficulties once the campaign begins. The piece also implies that the Clinton's focus on their own interests may lead to difficulties for others involved in their political endeavors.\n\nThe article does not provide a clear conclusion about Clinton's chances in a 2016 presidential campaign, instead presenting a balanced analysis of her strengths and weaknesses.",
    " Title: Uncertainty for 4 Million Unauthorized Immigrants as Deferred Action Program Remains Suspended\n\nArticle:\n\nAround four million unauthorized immigrants are currently in legal limbo more than two weeks after a federal judge in Texas suspended President Obama's move to temporarily protect them from deportation. Many of these parents of U.S. citizens and green-card holders are worried that the government will now force them to leave the U.S. The lack of legal clarity also means some of them are being treated inconsistently by government officials.\n\nWilfredis Ayala, a construction worker from El Salvador, would have been helped by President Obama's deferred action program for parents staying in the U.S. illegally. Ayala, 30, has been dodging deportation orders for the past 10 years after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally by car. Now living on Long Island, N.Y., with his U.S.-born, 5-year-old son, Justin, Ayala says he's never had trouble with the police\u2014until he was arrested last January for trespassing on private property while taking a shortcut through his neighborhood. That put him in the sights of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which was ready to finally deport him before his lawyer got him released from the detention center.\n\n\"I cried tears of joy to be with my son again, to be able to hug him and kiss him and play with him,\" Ayala says in Spanish. \"The whole time I was locked up I longed to be with him.\"\n\nAyala's lawyer, Bryan Johnson, argued that his client was eligible for Obama's deferred action program for parents, which temporarily protected Ayala from deportation until the Texas court ruling put the program on hold. Now, Johnson says he's not sure what will happen during their next appointment with immigration officials.\n\n\"I'm going to tell ICE that we're waiting for deferred action, and then from there, we'll see what happens,\" says Johnson, a partner at the immigration law firm Amoachi & Johnson. \"But I mean he's not safe because there is no deferred action to apply for.\"\n\nIn a statement, an ICE spokesman says the agency is still focusing on deporting criminals and those who recently crossed the border illegally first\u2014priorities that the president emphasized during a recent town hall meeting televised by MSNBC and Telemundo.\n\n\"If you've been here for a long time and if you qualify, generally, then during this period, even with legal uncertainty, they should be in a good place,\" Obama told the audience in Miami.\n\nHowever, Marty Rosenbluth, who teaches immigration law at Elon University, says that some local immigration offices have been applying the policy inconsistently and detaining parents who would have been left alone before the Texas court ruling.\n\n\"It's created a huge amount of fear, and people who were preparing to apply now don't know what to do,\" he says.\n\nRosenbluth adds this could have a long-term impact on Obama's deferred action programs if the courts allow them to take effect. (The government is still accepting applications for the original deferred action program for young immigrants who came before turning 16 and have lived in the U.S. since 2007.)\n\n\"Convincing people that it's safe is going to be a lot tougher even if this temporary injunction is overturned,\" he says.\n\nIt could be months before the legal battle over the president's deferred action programs is finished in the courts. A judge is still reviewing the Obama administration's request for the programs to go ahead while the lawsuit continues. However, Ayala is facing a much shorter timeline; he's due back in front of immigration officials next Wednesday.\n\n\"The truth is,\" he says in Spanish, \"I don't know what is going to happen that day.\"",

The transfers include some done through Swiss bank accounts, according to The New York Times.\n\nState Attorney General Letitia James (D) reportedly issued subpoenas last month to 33 financial institutions and investment advisers in an attempt to fully discover the family's wealth. While the Sacklers continue to negotiate settlements with victims, James stated, \"We refuse to allow the family to misuse the courts in an effort to shield their financial misconduct.\"\n\nRecords from one financial institution alone have shown approximately $1 billion in wire transfers between the Sacklers, entities they control, and different financial institutions, including those that have funneled funds into Swiss bank accounts. Court documents filed by James's office on Friday reportedly show initial findings from one unnamed financial institution. The filing reportedly shows a series of transfers by former Purdue board member Mortimer D.A. Sackler.\n\n\"Already, these records have allowed the state to identify previously unknown shell companies that one of the Sackler defendants used to shift Purdue money through accounts around the world and then conceal it in at least two separate multimillion-dollar real estate investments back here in New York, sanitized [until now] of any readily detectable connections to the Sackler family,\" wrote lawyer David E. Nachman from James's office in a letter to the court, according to the Times.\n\nPurdue Pharma declined to comment, while a spokesperson for Mortimer D.A. Sackler dismissed allegations surrounding the wire transfers. \"There is nothing newsworthy about these decade-old transfers, which were perfectly legal and appropriate in every respect. This is a cynical attempt by a hostile AG's office to generate defamatory headlines to try to torpedo a mutually beneficial settlement that is supported by so many other states and would result in billions of dollars going to communities and individuals across the country that need help,\" the spokesperson told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThe revelations come as Purdue Pharma has reached a multibillion-dollar tentative settlement with state and local governments over its alleged role in the opioid crisis.

    " Title: North Carolina Emerges as Evenly Divided Presidential Battleground\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Carolina, historically known for its contradictory political leanings, is currently experiencing a shift in its demographics, making it difficult to predict the state's tilt in the upcoming November elections. The state, which has elected figures like racial hard-liner Jesse Helms and New South Democrats like Terry Sanford and Jim Hunt, is now more evenly divided in presidential elections than ever.\n\nThe two largest population centers, Charlotte and the Research Triangle of Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, have undergone significant transformation due to an influx of political centrists from other states. The fastest-growing party registration preference is not Republican nor Democrat, but unaffiliated. The rural white \"Jessecrats,\" conservative Democrats who traditionally voted for Mr. Helms, are dwindling. The state's elections are now won in fast-growing edge towns like Cary, outside Raleigh, often jokingly referred to as Containment Area for Relocated Yankees.\n\nNeither Donald Trump, with his hard-edge nationalism, nor Hillary Clinton, with a swirl of scandal surrounding her, appears to be a natural fit for a state that yearns for political moderation but is increasingly disenchanted with the political class. Carter Wrenn, a veteran Republican strategist in the state, stated, \"They don't like either party and they don't like either candidate. It will just depend on which one they dislike less on Election Day.\"\n\nPolls indicate that Trump and Clinton begin the general election close in North Carolina. The most telling sign of a toss-up: Democrats believe Trump starts with a narrow advantage, while Republicans believe Clinton does. What they agree on is that, as at the national level, Republicans are largely coalescing around Trump, and ruling out the possibility that Clinton could run away with the state.\n\nHowever, Trump's difficulties among Hispanic voters could push typical swing states such as Colorado, Nevada, and Florida toward the Democrats. This could potentially force Trump to carry the combined 28 electoral votes from North Carolina and Virginia to capture the White House.",
    " Title: Tight Races and Uncertain Outcomes: A Look at the 2014 Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2014 midterm elections are expected to be a close contest, with many congressional and gubernatorial races remaining undecided as voters head to the polls. The battle for the Senate is largely a referendum on President Obama's final two years in office, with the outcome potentially hinging on approximately 10 toss-up or battleground races. At the state level, nearly a dozen governors are at risk of losing their seats, a volatile landscape not seen in decades.\n\nIn the Senate, three races are considered locked down for the Republican Party: Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia. However, Republicans remain in competitive races in a number of other states, including those that President Obama lost in 2012 and where he continues to have low approval ratings. This includes Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, and North Carolina. Arkansas is increasingly seen as a likely flip to Republican hands, with GOP Rep. Tom Cotton expected by many analysts to defeat Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor.\n\nIn the states Obama won in 2012, Republicans are competing. Topping this list are Iowa and Colorado, but Republican Scott Brown is also putting up a fight in his race against Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire. Republicans are battling to retain control of three seats: in Georgia, Kansas, and Kentucky.\n\nThe House of Representatives also sees tight races, with all 435 seats on the ballot. Of them, 233 are held by Republicans and 199 held by Democrats. Democrats would need 17 seats to take the majority, an unlikely possibility. Rather, Republicans are expected to pick up at least five more seats. Among the most compelling races are ones in Arizona and New York.\n\nIn Arizona, Republican Martha McSally, the first female Air Force pilot to fly in combat, is trying to take a House seat from Democrats. In New York, 30-year-old Republican Elise Stefanik would be the youngest female House member if she wins Tuesday. McSally is running in one of the few remaining moderate districts, for the seat once held by Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who retired from Congress in 2012 after being shot in the head during a mass shooting. McSally again faces Democratic Rep. Ron Barber, the former Giffords staffer who narrowly defeated McSally in 2012. The nonpartisan RealClearPolitics.com lists the race as a tossup.\n\nIn New York, Stefanik, a former Bush White House aide, has positioned herself as a first-time candidate eager to bring \"new ideas\" and \"new leadership\" to the upstate 21st District.

    " Title: Trump's Travel Ban: A Closer Look at the Six Countries and the Rationale Behind the Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the recent terrorist attack in London, President Donald Trump tweeted that \"we need to be smart, vigilant, and tough,\" \"stop being politically correct,\" and \"get down to the business of security for our people.\" The only concrete policy he mentioned was his temporary ban on visitors from six Muslim-majority countries, a measure that is unlikely to reduce the already tiny risk of dying in a terrorist attack.\n\nThe executive order, which covers six countries (down from seven in the original version), includes Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Since 1975, no one in the United States has died in an attack by a terrorist from any of those countries, although there have been less serious incidents, including two nonfatal knife attacks last year by people with Somali backgrounds, both of whom were killed in the midst of their assaults. From 1975 through 2015, according to a count by Cato Institute immigration analyst Alex Nowrasteh, six Iranians, six Sudanese, two Somalis, and one Yemini were \"convicted of attempting or carrying out terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.\"\n\nTrump's order mentions just one of those cases, involving \"a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen.\" As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit noted when it upheld the injunction against the travel ban, the order \"does not include any examples of individuals from Iran, Libya, Sudan, Syria, or Yemen committing terrorism-related offenses in the United States.\" However, Nowrasteh found at least 13 such cases involving people from Iran, Sudan, and Yemen.\n\nEven if Trump had included all the relevant examples, the case for targeting these six countries would be weak, since citizens of other countries account for a much larger share of terrorist plots, attacks, and casualties in the United States. From 1975 through 2015, Nowrasteh found, 19 foreign-born terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, 14 came from Pakistan, 11 came from Egypt, and 11 more came from Cuba. Their combined death toll was 2,537. During the same period, six foreign-born terrorists came from Iran, six from Sudan, two from Somalia, and one from Yemen. Zero came from Libya or Syria. The combined death toll for terrorists from those six countries was zero.\n\nNor is it clear how Trump's plan, which calls for the development of improved vetting procedures during the three months when citizens of the six countries would be forbidden to enter the United States, can reasonably be expected to catch the tiny percentage prone to terrorism. As an internal Department of Homeland Security report prepared last March notes, \"most foreign-born, US-based violent extremists likely radicalized several years after their entry to the United States, limiting the ability of screening and vetting officials to prevent their entry because of national security concerns.\" In the one relevant case cited by Trump's executive order, better vetting would have made no difference, since the offender entered the country as a child.\n\nIn a declaration cited by the 4th Circuit, 10 former national security, foreign policy, and intelligence officials (mostly from Democratic administrations) said \"there is no national security purpose for a total bar on entry for aliens\" from the seven countries named in the original travel ban (the current six plus Iraq). \"Since September 11, 2001,\" they said, \"not a single terrorist attack in the United States has been perpetrated by aliens from the countries named in the Order.\" As noted above, that is not quite accurate. But it is fair to say that Trump's selection of countries seems arbitrary given the backgrounds of terrorists who have carried out attacks in the United States, very few of whom came from any of those countries.\n\nThe same is true if you look at people convicted in connection with planned domestic attacks that never came to fruition. Nowrasteh identified four such cases involving people from the targeted countries (two from Iran and two from Somalia) since 9/11.\n\nTrump's travel ban may indeed be tough (at least as far as its impact on foreign nationals and their American relatives goes) and it may be (and probably is) constitutional. But that does not make it smart.\n\nAddendum: In a follow-up tweet this morning, Trump says, \"The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.\" That remark is weird for a couple of reasons: 1) It was Trump, not the Justice Department, who ultimately decided to issue a revised executive order rather than continue to defend the original version, and 2) excluding lawful permanent residents and current visa holders from the ban made the order harder to challenge.\n\nTrump compounds the weirdness in a subsequent tweet: \"The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court\u2014 & seek much tougher version!\" Reverting to the original order after successfully defending the revised one would only prolong the legal battle, and here again Trump makes it seem as if he is not really in charge of his own administration, that the Justice Department decides which executive orders to issue.",
    " Title: Republican Party Gains Lead on Generic Congressional Ballot, Trump Approval Rating Equals Disapproval in New Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll conducted by \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult, the Republican Party has taken the lead on the generic congressional ballot for the first time since April. The poll also shows President Donald Trump's approval rating matching the percentage of voters who disapprove of his job performance.\n\nAccording to the poll, 39% of registered voters would support the GOP candidate for Congress in their district, while 38% would back the Democratic candidate. Nearly a quarter of voters, 23%, are undecided.\n\nThe poll reveals a split among voters along party lines. Democratic voters favor their party by a significant margin, 85% to 5%, while Republicans similarly favor the GOP, 84% to 8%. Among independent voters, 26% would vote for the Democrat, 25% for the Republican, and nearly half, 49%, are undecided.\n\nThe Republican Party's 1-point advantage comes after three months of tracking during which Democrats maintained a lead ranging between 2 and 10 points on the generic ballot. The most recent RealClearPolitics average shows Democrats ahead by 7 points on the generic ballot, though that's down from a high of 13 points late last year.\n\nThe new year has also produced a Trump polling bump. In the new poll, 47% of voters approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while the same percentage disapprove. Among Democrats, 16% approve of Trump's job performance and 80% disapprove. The numbers are almost exactly inverted among Republicans: 82% approve, while 16% disapprove. Trump is still underwater among independents: 39% approve and 49% disapprove.\n\nLike with the generic ballot, other public polling is less rosy for Trump\u2014but there is a distinct improvement over the past two months. The president's average approval rating as of late Tuesday was 41%, up from a low-water mark of 37% in mid-December.\n\nThe poll shows that voters' perceptions of Republicans have recovered from the lows of late last year, including on a number of key issues. \"Not only have Republicans increased support on the generic congressional ballot, they are now trusted more to handle the most important issue when voters head to the polls: the economy,\" said Kyle Dropp, Morning Consult's co-founder and chief research officer. \"In mid-December, 39% of voters said they trusted Democrats more to handle the economy, compared to 38% who said Republicans. Today, 43% say Republicans and 32% say Democrats.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans also have a 9-point advantage on handling jobs, a 6-point lead on dealing with immigration, and a 19-point lead on handling national security. The Democratic advantage on health care has dwindled to just 4 percentage points, down from double digits last year.\n\nThe poll was conducted Feb. 8-12, surveying 1,985 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.

    " Title: Republican Senators Distance Themselves from Trump Amid Widening Clinton Leads in Key States\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing 2016 presidential race, several House Republicans and Senate incumbents are distancing themselves from the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado recently ran a commercial stating, \"Honestly, I don't care for him much,\" and vowed that if Trump were elected, \"I'll stand up to him. Plain and simple.\"\n\nKristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican pollster, notes that differentiating congressional candidates from the nominee may not be challenging. \"One great thing for many Republican candidates is that Donald Trump is unusual\u2014he's not a generic Republican,\" she said. \"In a state like Ohio, voters will be able to distinguish between Trump and Rob Portman.\" Senator Portman is currently locked in a tight race.\n\nSome endangered Senate incumbents, such as Mark Kirk of Illinois, have flatly declared they will not vote for Trump. Most others, however, are trying to avoid offending Trump's fervent followers while not alienating more independent-minded centrists. Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire stated she is supporting Trump but isn't endorsing him. If he comes to her state, she will be absent.\n\nSenator Ayotte's supporters want her to distance herself further, especially since Trump called her \"weak\" last week. Few Republicans are suffering as much as Senator John McCain of Arizona. Privately, he has contempt for Trump, but the senator faces a right-wing primary challenge this month, in which many Trump supporters will turn out. Even when Trump took a shot at him last week, McCain held his fire and reiterated that he always supports the party nominee.\n\nRecent polls suggest that this delicate facade may be cracking. Hillary Clinton has opened up significant leads in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, with signs that Trump is dragging down incumbent senators. Republican strategists say a five-point Clinton victory in these states is survivable for down-ballot candidates. Anything more, particularly if her margin hits double digits, might mean curtains.\n\nDemocrats today are more optimistic that these wider margins are possible, noting that in this polarized environment, ticket-splitting is less prevalent. And waves, as Gaylord Nelson discovered in 1980, usually break late.",
    " Title: Jonathan Gruber's Remarks on Affordable Care Act Spark Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of videos released over the past few days, economist Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), has been caught making controversial remarks about the American public and the passage of the healthcare legislation.\n\nIn one video from 2010, Gruber stated that the American public \"doesn't actually care that much about the uninsured.\" In another video from 2012, he claimed that the Obama administration successfully relied on an electorate that didn't fully understand the legislation.\n\nGruber also said in a speech at the University of Pennsylvania in 2013 that the very function of the law, doing what it was designed to do, was unpalatable to voters. He stated, \"If you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in -- if you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed.\"\n\nGruber also admitted that the sales pitch for the law was a cover-up operation, stating, \"Lack of transparency is a huge advantage. And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever. But basically, that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.\"\n\nThese videos have sparked controversy, with critics arguing that Gruber's remarks demonstrate a lack of respect for the American public and a belief that the administration hoodwinked the American people to pass the legislation.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Gruber's remarks were made in public lectures, not in private meetings with liberal donors. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act's reliance on healthy people paying in to cover sick people was not a secret, and the administration spent millions on a marketing campaign to convince young, healthy people to invest in health insurance.\n\nFurthermore, opponents of the legislation were vocal about the potential problems with the law, and numerous advocacy groups, impartial economists, and media outlets were fact-checking the President's rosy predictions about the law.\n\nDespite Gruber's claims, the American people never voted on Obamacare, and the law has never enjoyed a majority of public support since its passage. According to Kaiser Family tracking polls, the law has never cracked a 51% favorability rating and has at times plummeted to the low 30s.\n\nIn conclusion, while Jonathan Gruber's remarks may be seen as arrogant and offensive, it is important to consider the context in which they were made and the public's awareness of the Affordable Care Act's reliance on healthy people paying in to cover sick people. The controversy surrounding Gruber's remarks is likely to continue as the Affordable Care Act's implementation and impact are debated in the coming years.",
    " Title: Senate Passes Bipartisan Budget Deal, Averting Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A bipartisan budget and debt deal, which would permit the government to resume borrowing to pay all its bills and avoid a potential government shutdown in October, was passed by the Senate on Thursday in a 67-28 vote. The legislation, which President Donald Trump has promised to sign, would set an overall $1.37 trillion limit on agency budgets approved by Congress annually.\n\nThe deal, which was powered by President Trump's endorsement and a bipartisan drive to cement recent spending increases for the Pentagon and domestic agencies, marked a drama-free solution to a worrisome set of looming Washington deadlines. The measure does nothing to stem the government's spiraling debt and the return of $1 trillion-plus deficits but it also takes away the prospect of a government shutdown in October or the threat of deep automatic spending cuts.\n\nThe administration and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., played strong hands in the talks that sealed the agreement last week, producing a pragmatic measure that had much for lawmakers to dislike. Trump did step back from a possible fight over spending increases sought by liberals, and he achieved his priorities on Pentagon budgets and the stock market-soothing borrowing limit.\n\n\"Budget Deal is phenomenal for our Great Military, our Vets, and Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!\" Trump tweeted before the vote. \"Two year deal gets us past the Election. Go for it Republicans, there is always plenty of time to CUT!\"\n\nThe bill was an epitaph to the 2011 Budget Control Act, which came about due to a tea party-fueled battle over debt limit legislation during the run-up to President Barack Obama's re-election. That law promised more than $2 trillion in deficit cuts through 2021, including automatic spending cuts that were put in place after the failure of a so-called deficit supercommittee.\n\nThe bill would lift the debt limit for two years, into either a second Trump term or the administration of a Democratic successor. It would reverse scheduled 10 percent cuts to defense and nondefense programs next year, at a two-year cost of more than $200 billion. An additional $100 billion over two years would add to recent gains for military readiness, combating opioids, and other domestic initiatives, and would keep pace with rising costs for veterans' health care.\n\nThose increases alone, assuming they are repeated year after year, promise to add $2 trillion or more to the government's $22 trillion debt over the coming decade. The bill was powered by a coalition of GOP defense hawks, Democrats seeking to preserve gains in domestic accounts, and the leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Democrats voted for the bill by a wide margin, and it won a healthy majority of Senate Republicans.\n\n\"Providing sufficient funding for our military and eliminating the threat of sequestration for good are absolutely necessary for our military to have the budgetary stability and predictability they so desperately need,\" said the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.\n\nIt was also a long-sought victory for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who initiated the negotiations and was deeply invested in bringing order and relative predictability to the budget and debt deadlines. Losers included more conservative elements of the White House. Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, a former tea party congressman from South Carolina, and acting budget director Russell Vought were rebuffed in attempts to add spending cuts to defray the bill's cost.",
    " Title: White House Defends Obama's Legacy, Trump Criticizes Black Progress under Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, Donald Trump claimed that black Americans have not made progress under President Barack Obama, a claim that has sparked controversy and debate. The White House, however, has maintained that blacks have made progress under the first black president, and that Trump's policies would reverse these gains.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the black unemployment rate in July was 8.4 percent, compared to 12.6 percent when President Obama took office in January 2009. However, the jobless rate for whites, currently at 4.3 percent, has fallen slightly more than it has for blacks over the past eight years, decreasing by 37 percent for whites and 33 percent for blacks.\n\nOn a range of other government data, blacks are faring worse under President Obama. The black labor force participation rate has fallen from 63.2 percent in 2009 to 61.2 percent last month. Black homeownership last month was 41.7 percent, down from 46.1 percent in 2009 \u2013 a drop of nearly one-tenth. The percentage of black Americans living below the poverty line has risen from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent in 2014, according to the most recent Census Bureau data. The number of black food-stamp participants increased 58 percent, from 7.3 million to 11.7 million.\n\nIn response to these statistics, the White House has emphasized the importance of electing Hillary Clinton as president to build on President Obama's legacy. White House press secretary Josh Earnest stated, \"The president\u2019s never made the case that the work is finished, that the job is done. The point is, President Obama\u2019s interested in being succeeded in office by someone who is committed to building on the progress we\u2019ve made thus far as opposed to tearing it down.\"\n\nBlack leaders have criticized Trump's claim that he will improve conditions for black Americans. Ben Jealous, former president of the NAACP, stated, \"Donald Trump is dancing around on race and immigration, because his racism and xenophobia is threatening to trump the GOP\u2019s chances to hold on to the Senate let alone take back the White House.\"\n\nDespite little evidence that Trump's plea to black voters is changing minds, dissatisfaction among blacks with the lack of progress under President Obama has been no secret. Tavis Smiley, broadcaster, stated earlier this year, \"Sadly \u2013 and it pains me to say this \u2013 over the last decade, black folk, in the era of Obama, have lost ground in every major economic category.\"\n\nThe Urban League's National Equality Index has found blacks losing ground, from 57.4 percent equality with whites in 2009 to 56.2 percent this year. This year's rating represented a slight improvement from 55.8 percent in 2015. The report lamented \"an all-too-familiar story of persistent racial disparities in American life, making clear that the historic Obama presidency has not been a panacea for America\u2019s long-standing race problem.\"\n\nThe White House is arguing that, with President Obama having lowered jobless rates dramatically for whites and blacks, Hillary Clinton has better proposals than Trump to benefit all workers. White House press secretary Josh Earnest stated, \"The kinds of proposals that have been put forward by the other side would have the effect of eroding our progress, primarily because they would have a devastating impact fiscally and economically doling out significant tax cuts to those at the top of the income scale and leaving the rest of us to pay the tab.\"\n\nMrs. Clinton moved more aggressively Thursday, using a campaign ad and a speech, to link Trump to white supremacists such as former KKK figure David Duke. She said Trump is \"helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party.\" Trump responded by accusing Clinton of \"race baiting.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Delivers Remarks at National Prayer Breakfast Amid Impeachment Acquittal\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. \u2013 President Donald Trump delivered remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, a day after his Senate acquittal in the impeachment trial. Trump used the event to criticize those who supported the impeachment drive, stating, \"My family, our great country, and your president have been put through a terrible ordeal by some very dishonest and corrupt people.\"\n\nTrump entered the venue waving copies of newspapers with headlines such as \"ACQUITTED\" and \"Trump Acquitted.\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., commented before the president spoke, stating, \"The Lord works in mysterious ways. I do not believe he could\u2019ve picked a better day to bring us all together.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who led the impeachment drive, was also present at the event. Trump and Pelosi did not interact personally, with Trump commenting, \"I do not like people who say 'I pray for you,' when they know that is not so.\" In December, Pelosi stated, \"I pray for the president all the time.\"\n\nAfter the event, Pelosi described Trump's comments as \"completely inappropriate,\" stating, \"Especially at a prayer breakfast.\" Several speakers at the event addressed political polarization and prayed for the nation to overcome it.\n\nTrump recounted his actions supporting school prayer and international efforts to prevent the persecution of Christians. The National Prayer Breakfast, a Washington tradition since 1953, was established by President Dwight Eisenhower at the suggestion of evangelist Billy Graham.\n\nUtah Sen. Mitt Romney, the GOP's nominee for president in 2012, was the only senator to vote to convict Trump on the charge of abuse of power. Romney cited the evidence and his Mormon faith in his decision, calling Trump's conduct \"grievously wrong.\" Trump responded with a midnight tweet about Romney's 2012 loss, stating, \"If the candidate had devoted the same energy and anger to defeating a faltering Barack Obama as he sanctimoniously does to me, he could have won the election.\"\n\nHistorian Kevin Kruse of Princeton University, who has studied the National Prayer Breakfast, told a news outlet, \"I can't say how bizarre it is for a president to use the moment \u2013 traditionally one devoted to bipartisanship and unity \u2013 to strike such a vindictive tone.\" Trump concluded his remarks by stating, \"When they impeach you for nothing, then you're supposed to like them, it's not easy, folks. I do my best.\"",
    " Title: Grand Princess Cruise Ship Halted Off California Coast After First Known COVID-19 Death in State\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Grand Princess cruise ship is currently stationary off the California coast following the state's first known death from COVID-19. Health workers are set to test some of the current passengers to determine the presence of the respiratory virus.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom announced at a news conference on Wednesday that they will be sending testing kits to the ship, with results expected in a few hours. Eleven passengers and ten crew members are reportedly showing symptoms of COVID-19, with the number potentially understating the virus's presence on the ship.\n\nGovernor Newsom declared a state of emergency in California on Wednesday to help the state cope with its first COVID-19 death and over 50 confirmed cases overall. The passenger who died was an elderly man who, health officials believe, was exposed to the novel coronavirus during a trip from San Francisco to Mexico in mid-February.\n\nAnother California resident who was on the same trip has also tested positive for the virus. The man was on the ship from February 11-21 and had underlying health conditions before being hospitalized in California's Placer County on February 27.\n\nThe Grand Princess is carrying approximately 2,500 passengers and 1,150 crew members. Only a small fraction of these individuals will be tested, with the remainder of the people on board being asked to monitor themselves for any possible symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nTo carry out the tests, the California National Guard plans to use a helicopter to deliver kits to the Grand Princess on Thursday morning. The onboard medical team will then collect samples, which will be flown back to shore to be analyzed at a lab in Richmond, Calif.\n\nIn a letter sent to current passengers who were also on the earlier trip, Princess Cruises informed them that they must remain in their staterooms until cleared by the medical staff. The exact date and time for the ship's arrival are yet to be determined.\n\nAfter the Grand Princess completed its Mexico trip, the ship left California for a cruise to Hawaii. It is now returning from that voyage, and operator Princess Cruises has canceled the ship's scheduled call in Ensenada, Mexico, to bring it off the coast near San Francisco on Thursday.\n\nSan Francisco announced its first two COVID-19 cases on Thursday: a man in his 90s hospitalized in serious condition and a woman in her 40s hospitalized in fair condition. Both were tested by the state department of public health on March 4.\n\nThe Grand Princess is the second Princess Cruises ship to be identified with a potential cluster of coronavirus cases. Last month, the Diamond Princess was held in quarantine for weeks at the port in Yokohama, Japan.\n\nPrincess Cruises has canceled the Grand Princess's next planned Hawaii cruise, which was to depart on Saturday. About half of the people who were on the cruise to Mexico are California residents, and authorities are working to contact them and urge them to monitor themselves for potential COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nCalifornia health agencies are currently monitoring at least 9,400 people in 49 counties who were potentially exposed to the coronavirus through air travel. In addition to heightening the state's response to the coronavirus outbreak, the governor's emergency declaration forbids price gouging on products that are important in fighting viruses, such as hand sanitizer.\n\nThe U.S. now has at least 99 domestic cases of coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This figure does not include the 49 cases in which Americans were repatriated to the U.S. on evacuation flights from Japan and from Wuhan, China, where the novel coronavirus was first detected.",
    " Title: Record 3.7 Million Gun Background Checks in March, Suggested by COVID-19 Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) processed a record 3.7 million gun background checks in March, surpassing any previously reported monthly total, according to the agency's latest data. This surge in gun sales appears to be, at least in part, linked to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Trump administration this week designated gun shops as \"essential\" businesses, enabling them to continue selling firearms to both existing and new customers, while other retail outlets have closed their doors. Five of the top ten days with the highest number of background checks occurred in March, since the inception of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System in 1998.\n\nMarch ranks as the second-busiest month ever for gun sales, trailing only January 2013, which followed President Obama's re-election and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, according to the New York Times.\n\nDavid Yamane, a sociology professor at Wake Forest who has studied gun culture, attributes the increase in gun buying to mass social uncertainty. He stated, \"In times of crisis, people tend to buy guns.\"\n\nReports of increased firearm and ammunition purchases, as well as an influx of first-time gun buyers, have already been documented in areas heavily impacted by COVID-19, such as Washington state, California, and New York. Yamane noted, \"In addition to the usual suspects who are adding to what they already own, there has been a sort of different profile of people coming in [to gun shops]. In this instance, people who are first-time gun owners or do not fit the traditional demographic of older, white male.\"\n\nThe latest installment of the \u2588\u2588\u2588-Ipsos Coronavirus Index also indicated rises in purchases of guns and ammunition, although the sample size was relatively small.\n\nIn a video tweeted by the National Rifle Association (NRA) on March 21, an activist warned, \"You might be stockpiling up on food right now, but if you aren't preparing to defend your property when everything goes wrong, you're really just stockpiling for somebody else.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Decide Fate of Gay Marriage and Voting Rights Act\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to deliver major rulings on two significant cases this week. One case challenges California's voter-enacted ban on same-sex marriage, while the other concerns the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) provision that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman.\n\nIn the California case, the Supreme Court is expected to rule on the constitutionality of Proposition 8, a voter-approved amendment to the state constitution that defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Potential outcomes include nationwide invalidation of bans on gay marriage, legalization of gay marriage only in California and six other states with similar legal structures, or resumption of same-sex marriages in California alone. The justices may also uphold Prop 8.\n\nThe court heard oral arguments in the four-year-old case in March, with several justices expressing doubts about the case's validity. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is often considered the potentially decisive vote on a closely divided court, suggested that the court could dismiss the case with no ruling at all. Such an outcome would allow gay marriages to resume in California but have no impact elsewhere.\n\nIn the DOMA case, the justices are considering the constitutionality of a provision that affects a range of benefits available to married couples, including tax breaks, survivor benefits, and health insurance for spouses of federal employees. The Obama administration abandoned its defense of the law in 2011 but continues to enforce it.\n\nThe justices chose the case of Edith Windsor, an 83-year-old New York resident, who sued to challenge a $363,000 federal estate tax bill after her partner of 44 years died in 2009. During the March hearing, Justice Kennedy expressed concerns about the law's intrusion on the power of states that recognize same-sex marriages. Other justices described the law as creating two classes of marriage: full marriage and \"skim-milk marriage.\"\n\nIf the Supreme Court finds that it does not have the authority to hear the case, Windsor would likely still receive her refund, as she won in the lower courts. However, there would be no definitive decision about the law from the nation's highest court, and it would remain on the books.\n\nIn a separate ruling on Tuesday, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to strike down the requirement in the Voting Rights Act that all or parts of 15 states with a history of discrimination in voting, mainly in the South, get Washington's approval before changing the way they hold elections. The court ruled that the formula determining which states are affected was unconstitutional.\n\nThe ruling potentially opens the door for certain states to implement voter ID laws and other efforts that had been held up because of the Voting Rights Act. Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican, stated that Texas' voter ID law, which a panel of federal judges blocked as discriminatory, would be allowed to take effect following Tuesday's ruling.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder warned states against going too far, stating that the Justice Department would not hesitate to take \"swift\" action against states looking to \"take advantage\" of the ruling. He, like President Obama, expressed disappointment in the decision, stating that discriminatory practices still exist and need to be addressed.\n\nThe high court is currently engaged in a broad re-examination of the ongoing necessity of laws and programs aimed at giving racial minorities access to major areas of American life from which they once were excluded. The justices issued a modest ruling on Monday that preserved affirmative action in higher education and will take on cases dealing with anti-discrimination sections of a federal housing law and another affirmative action case from Michigan next term.",
    " Title: The Unattainability of Revolutionary Change: A Critique of Bernie Sanders' Campaign Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Democratic primary, a critical analysis of Bernie Sanders' campaign strategy has emerged, suggesting that the senator's call for a \"revolution\" in the United States is unrealistic and potentially detrimental to the progressive cause.\n\nThe argument posits that the economic conditions necessary for a revolution, such as high unemployment, stagnant wages, and widespread dissatisfaction with the system, are not present in the current U.S. economy. Unemployment remains at 5%, wages have been stagnant since the turn of the century but still average close to $70,000, and 90% of the country has health insurance coverage.\n\nThe critique asserts that, given these economic conditions, a revolution is unlikely to occur. Instead, the author suggests that meaningful change must be achieved through the \"slow boring of hard wood,\" a metaphor for the slow, incremental process of political change.\n\nThe author's concern lies in the potential consequences of promising a revolution that may never materialize. If the revolution fails, the author fears that Sanders' impressionable young followers may become disillusioned with politics and abandon their pursuit of change. This could lead to a net increase in political cynicism and potentially discourage talented future leaders from engaging in politics.\n\nThe author acknowledges that their argument and those of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama may not be as inspiring as Sanders' promises, but argues that the goals must be attainable to prevent disillusionment among followers. By offering a \"chimera\" instead, the author contends, Sanders has done the progressive movement no favors.\n\nIn conclusion, this critique of Bernie Sanders' campaign strategy argues that the call for a revolution is unrealistic given the current economic conditions in the United States. Instead, the author advocates for a more pragmatic, incremental approach to political change to avoid disillusioning potential future leaders and increasing political cynicism.",
    " Title: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Threatens Legal Action Over Whistleblower Complaint\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has vowed to take legal action against the Trump administration over a dispute regarding a whistleblower complaint to the intelligence community's inspector general, Michael Atkinson. The dispute centers around a complaint from an unidentified individual within the intelligence community concerning activity involving a high-ranking individual, which Schiff suggests is likely President Trump or someone close to him.\n\nDuring a closed-door meeting with Atkinson, Schiff stated that the Justice Department has opined that the material is privileged and can be withheld from lawmakers. However, Schiff argues that the law and practice are clear: Congress oversees the intelligence agencies, and in this case, it must see the materials at issue.\n\nSchiff told NPR on Thursday that if the administration is able to withhold the information, the whistleblower statute would not function, and it would discourage people from coming forward. He added that if they have to go to court to obtain the complaint, they will have a strong case.\n\nPresident Trump has denied making any inappropriate comments to a foreign leader, stating in a series of tweets that \"Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself.\" Trump also questioned the credibility of the reports, stating, \"Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call?\"\n\nSchiff stated earlier that the intelligence community's inspector general determined that the complaint is both credible and urgent and should be transmitted to Congress under the law. Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is set to testify in an open session before the panel next week.\n\nThe committee has released letters it received from the inspector general and a letter from Schiff to acting DNI Maguire. The Washington Post reported that the as-yet-unknown intelligence official filed a formal complaint to the IG on Aug. 12, and records show the president had \"conversations or interactions\" with five foreign leaders in the preceding weeks, including a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and two letters from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nOther members of Congress, such as Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who sits on the Senate intelligence committee, are waiting to learn more about the complaint. Cornyn stated, \"I'm anxious to hear more about it, but I expect we will in due course.\"\n\nThe dispute over the IG complaint is the latest political battle between Schiff and Trump, who have clashed frequently during the height of the Russia imbroglio. Schiff was among Democrats who said there was evidence that Trump's campaign colluded with the Russian attack on the 2016 election, citing the meeting that Donald Trump Jr. and other top aides took with a delegation from Moscow at Trump Tower. However, Schiff also alluded to evidence that was not public, including questions about whether Trump Jr.'s phone records from before the Trump Tower meeting might suggest that he had spoken with his father as it was being arranged. As it turned out, they did not, and Trump Jr. and the president have made Schiff a target of mockery and one of the faces of what Trump says is baseless hounding. The president revived that leitmotif on Thursday with another post on Twitter that complained about \"Presidential Harassment!\"",
    " Title: Mueller's Testimony Leaves Political Landscape Unchanged, According to Sources\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a seemingly unchanged political landscape, former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's testimony did not appear to shift Speaker Nancy Pelosi's calculation regarding impeachment proceedings. The Senate Republicans' continued opposition to conviction in a potential Senate trial, which requires a two-thirds vote to remove President Donald Trump from office, has maintained the status quo.\n\nJeff Flake, the former Arizona senator who is one of the few prominent Republicans to openly defy Mr. Trump, commented, \"It will certainly ratchet up pressure on the Dems to initiate impeachment proceedings, but I don't think it changes the fundamentals much.\" Flake added, \"It's still a bad move in terms of 2020, and the speaker knows it.\"\n\nAt the White House, President Trump watched Mueller's testimony on television from the residence, spending most of the day there. Afterward, he met briefly with a few members of his staff and issued claims of vindication via Twitter and a press statement. However, privately, Trump reportedly complained that Mueller had always been out to get him and was frustrated that more people were not defending him on television, according to sources informed about his day.\n\nAides within the West Wing described a dominant feeling of outrage towards Mueller, but they also concluded that the special counsel had not altered the overall dynamics. No new facts emerged, and no smoking gun that had not already been known was presented. Mueller made clear that he would not go beyond his report even if he was called before a congressional committee.\n\nOne White House aide described the situation as stirring things up, similar to shaking a snow globe. Rarely has a high-profile special prosecutor left Washington so flummoxed, as former Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski left no doubt about his conclusions regarding President Richard M. Nixon, persuading a grand jury to name him an unindicted co-conspirator before his resignation.",
    " Title: Senate Debates Proposed Immigration Overhaul, Boston Bombing Overshadows Discussion on Agriculture Workers' Legal Status\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats and Republicans are currently debating a proposed immigration overhaul, with a focus on the eligibility of agricultural workers for a new \"blue card\" that would grant them permanent residence after five years. The debate, held at the second hearing since the bill's introduction, has been marked by disagreements over whether illegal immigrants working on U.S. farms should be eligible for the blue card.\n\nNon-farmer workers in the United States illegally would have to wait about twice as long to achieve this status. However, the Senate Judiciary Committee debate has been overshadowed by the Boston Marathon bombings and the legal status of the two Russian-born suspects.\n\nNew York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer stated that the tragedy should not be used as an \"excuse\" for delaying the passage of immigration reform legislation. The debate was emotionally charged, with Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the committee, expressing frustration. On Friday, Grassley stated that the circumstances related to the tragic bombings underscore the \"gaps and loopholes\" in the country's immigration system.\n\nCommittee Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., began the hearing by stating, \"Late last week opponents of comprehensive immigration reform began to exploit the Boston Marathon bombing... Let no one be so cruel as to try to use the heinous acts of two young men last week to derail the dreams and futures of millions of hardworking people.\"\n\nA bipartisan group of eight senators has been working on immigration reform legislation since January, an effort in part by both parties to reach out to Hispanics, the fastest-growing part of the U.S. population. The legislation was officially introduced last week, and five Senate hearings on the overall issue have been held so far this year. Chamber leaders expect to start submitting amendments in May with a vote this summer.\n\nThere are an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., and as many as 70% of U.S. agricultural workers are in the country illegally. Roughly 700,000 to 1.1 million illegal agricultural workers would be eligible for the blue card, provided they have at least a two-year work history and pass a criminal background check, pay fines, and taxes.\n\nSupporters argue the change is needed in large part because of the high percentage of illegal workers in the industry and Americans' reluctance to perform the work. Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions argued that the guidelines for the proposal were crafted as part of a deal between big business and organized labor that benefits the United States the most. He also took issue with the argument about \"jobs Americans won't do.\"\n\nRepublican Sens. John Cornyn, Texas, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, also raised concerns about how well the overall legislation will improve the tracking of immigrants who overstay their visas. Graham repeated his argument that the 19 hijackers involved in the 9/11 terror attacks were all students who overstayed their visas.",
    " Title: California Attorney General Charges Undercover Journalists, Ignores Alleged Fetal Harvesting Confession\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of undercover videos released by the Center for Medical Progress, one video stands out for its graphic depiction of a Planned Parenthood employee's account of fetal tissue harvesting. Holly O' Donnell, a former StemExpress technician, described an incident at Planned Parenthood Mar Monte's Alameda Clinic in San Jose, California, where she was asked to \"harvest\" a fetus's brain.\n\nO' Donnell's account, if accurate, could be considered a confession of murder under California law. The California Penal Code defines murder as the \"unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought.\" Planned Parenthood is alleged to have refused to render care to a born-alive infant, as required by California law, and to have acted affirmatively to cause the child's death.\n\nDespite this revelation, major newspapers, mainstream websites, and nightly news outlets reportedly ignored the story. Now, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has filed 15 felony charges against the undercover journalists, David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, on the grounds that their recordings of business-related conversations without every participant's consent violated California eavesdropping laws.\n\nBecerra, a Democrat, has received financial support from Planned Parenthood and has a 100% legislative rating from pro-abortion groups. In the past, his office has investigated claims of animal cruelty on chicken farms, but not homicide at abortion clinics.\n\nThe Center for Medical Progress's undercover videos have revealed Planned Parenthood's trade in fetal parts and its apparent disregard for the law. The videos have also exposed the moral rot within the abortion industry, with conversations about crushing babies to death and joking about the physical demands of dismembering a fetus.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Center for Medical Progress released a new video, in which Daleiden discusses abortion procedures with Dr. DeShawn Taylor, former medical director of Planned Parenthood Arizona, and the founder of her own abortion clinic in Phoenix. Taylor notes that, in Arizona, if a fetus shows signs of life, it is supposed to be transported to a hospital. Asked about a standard procedure for \"verifying life,\" she replies, \"The thing is, you need to pay attention to who's in the room, right?\"\n\nThe Center for Medical Progress's work has prompted debate about the ethical boundaries of undercover journalism and the role of the media in exposing controversial practices. The organization's founder, David Daleiden, has been compared to whistleblowers who expose corruption and wrongdoing in various industries. The ongoing legal battle between Daleiden, Merritt, and the California Department of Justice is a testament to the power of undercover journalism and the importance of transparency in the medical field.",
    " Title: Obama Pays Tribute to Fallen Heroes on Memorial Day\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his weekly address on Saturday, U.S. President Barack Obama commemorated Memorial Day by honoring the men and women who have sacrificed their lives in service to the country. The president urged all Americans to recognize and honor the nation's fallen heroes and stand with its veterans and military families this weekend.\n\nIn his address, Obama highlighted the importance of remembering the sacrifices made by these heroes, stating, \"They are heroes, each and every one. They gave America the most precious thing they had -- 'the last full measure of devotion.'\"\n\nThe president emphasized the quiet and unassuming nature of those who serve in the military, noting that their service and sacrifice are not always apparent due to their skill and the fact that they do not seek recognition or admiration. He also acknowledged the ideals of liberty and justice that these individuals have fought and died for, making America a beacon of hope for the world.\n\nObama also emphasized the importance of supporting the families of those currently serving and ensuring that veterans receive the care and benefits they have earned, as well as the jobs and opportunities they deserve. He concluded by urging Americans to remember the fallen heroes in their hearts and to work together to preserve the freedoms their sacrifices have secured.\n\nThe full transcript of Obama's address can be found on the White House website, and video of the address can be found on the White House's YouTube channel.",
    " Title: Christian Business Leaders to Connect with Israeli Innovation at ARISE Conference\n\nArticle:\n\nMore than 600 business leaders from over 50 countries will gather in Israel for the second-annual ARISE conference on December 4, aiming to connect with and invest in Israeli business leaders. The theme of the conference, \"Israeli Innovation for Humanity,\" will highlight Israeli companies in the medical, agricultural, transportation, and other fields whose products contribute to humanity.\n\nARISE Founder and President Adv. Calev Myers stated that the summit serves as a countermeasure against the global anti-Israel Boycotts, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Myers explained, \"The best way to fight BDS is by bringing more business to Israel.\"\n\nThe ARISE team will facilitate hundreds of face-to-face meetings between Christian business leaders and Israeli companies to establish long-term investment relationships. The goal is to generate millions of dollars worth of transactions that strengthen Christian businesses and Israel's economy.\n\nMyers emphasized that the conference offers Christians an entry point to Israel's economy through business matchmaking. He explained, \"When you connect your business with a for-profit relationship, you're going to be coming to Israel more, you're going to be looking over your investments and your business, you're going to be reading Israeli headlines. It connects you on a deeper level.\"\n\nThose unable to attend the event in Rishon Lezion can still participate online through ARISE's digital platform, where business owners can upload their profiles and chat with attendees. The conference will also feature a \"Shark Tank\"-style competition for Israeli companies and businesses to present their best products to the conference attendees. The winning business will receive a $10,000 grant from ARISE.\n\nMyers also announced plans for a global trade center in Jerusalem, set to launch in 2022. He stated, \"I can't think of a better way to humiliate BDS than by opening up a fully-functioning global trade center in Jerusalem.\" The trade center will be a partnership between faith-based business networks worldwide, aiming to streamline the process of bringing Israeli innovation to the nations.\n\nMyers encourages Christians worldwide to participate in next week's conference.",
    " Title: Obama's Shift in Approach to U.S. Capabilities and International Crises\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement, Jeremy Shapiro, a former Obama State Department official now at the Brookings Institution, suggested that U.S. presidents, including President Obama, have been reluctant to discuss deficiencies in capability due to the expectation of omnipotence and the associated sense of power. Shapiro added that Obama has been attempting to change this perception in the last year, recognizing that the demands of omnipotence have become disproportionate to what can be achieved.\n\nHowever, the risk exists that the president may appear to be merely justifying his own actions or inactions, as noted by Daniel L. Byman, a former member of the Sept. 11 commission staff now teaching at Georgetown University. Byman expressed concern that Obama does not differentiate between issues he can influence and those beyond his control.\n\nThe criticisms leveled against President Obama are numerous. According to his detractors, he failed to curb the growth of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria by rejecting proposals to arm moderate elements of the Syrian resistance. Additionally, he left a power vacuum in Iraq by not taking steps to maintain a residual force after the withdrawal of American troops in 2011. Furthermore, his actions are perceived as signaling weakness to Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, encouraging the Kremlin to intervene in Ukraine without fear of significant consequences.\n\nWilliam C. Inboden, a former national security aide to President George W. Bush and executive director of the William P. Clements Jr. Center on History, Strategy and Statecraft at the University of Texas, offered a more nuanced perspective. Inboden acknowledged that President Obama is not solely responsible for the various international crises that have occurred during his tenure. However, he is accountable for actions and attitudes that have contributed to some of those crises, as well as for his responses or lack thereof.",
    " Title: EPA Chief Scott Pruitt Resigns Amid Ethics Controversies, Andrew Wheeler to Serve as Acting Administrator\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief Scott Pruitt resigned on Thursday, stepping down under heavy fire for a series of ethics-related controversies. Pruitt, who had been lauded by President Donald Trump for his aggressive efforts to roll back environmental regulations, was one of Trump's most polarizing Cabinet members.\n\nPruitt, during his tenure as EPA administrator, slashed regulations on the energy and manufacturing industries, including a move to repeal President Barack Obama's signature program to cut carbon emissions from power plants, known as the Clean Power Plan. He was also instrumental in lobbying Trump to withdraw the United States from the global 2015 Paris climate accord to combat global warming.\n\nHowever, Pruitt lost favor with Trump's inner circle after a string of controversies, including first-class travel at taxpayer expense, lavish spending on security, the installation of a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in his office, and accusations that he used his position to receive favors, such as a discounted rental on a high-end condo from an energy lobbyist's wife.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Pruitt stated, \"The unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us.\" EPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former mining industry lobbyist, will become the regulatory agency's acting chief on Monday. Wheeler is widely expected to continue Pruitt's efforts to roll back and streamline regulation, something that Trump had promised in his presidential campaign.\n\nDemocrats and environmental advocacy groups celebrated the departure of Pruitt, a close ally of the fossil fuel industry who has often questioned mainstream climate change science. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Trump made the \"right decision.\"\n\nPruitt, as Oklahoma's attorney general before heading up the EPA, had sued the federal agency more than a dozen times on behalf of his oil-drilling state. Pruitt also rankled some Republican lawmakers, including in Midwest corn-producing states, with his efforts to overhaul a U.S. policy requiring biofuels like corn-based ethanol in gasoline.\n\nPruitt's interim replacement, Wheeler, was formerly a lobbyist for Murray Energy, the country's largest underground coal mining company, and also worked for Senator Jim Inhofe, a self-described climate skeptic, on efforts to combat climate legislation.\n\nPruitt was facing around a dozen investigations into his tenure, including his frequent use of first-class flights and his spending on security \u2013 which the agency has defended as necessary to defend him against unprecedented threats. Travel records showed the U.S. government spent $17,000 in taxpayer money on a December trip to Morocco to promote U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, which is not part of the EPA's jurisdiction. The Washington Post reported that a longtime Pruitt friend and lobbyist helped arrange the trip and later registered as a foreign agent representing Morocco.\n\nIn one of the investigations, the U.S. Government Accountability Office concluded that the EPA violated two laws by installing the $43,000 phone booth for Pruitt's office without telling lawmakers first. Pruitt said his staff never told him the cost. Some of the ethics accusations against Pruitt also involved jobs for his wife. Emails obtained by the Sierra Club environmental group showed Pruitt had an aide contact the chief executive of a fast-food chain about his wife becoming a franchise owner.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Pruitt had aides also try to get his wife a job at the Republican Attorneys General Association with a salary topping $200,000. Pruitt also had an employee carry out his personal errands, including researching the purchase of an old mattress from the Trump International Hotel, according to an interview transcript released by congressional Democrats last month. A source close to Trump said the controversy over the search for a used Trump International Hotel mattress was the last straw for Trump with Pruitt because it involved the Trump Organization.",
    " Title: California Governor Gavin Newsom Signs Controversial Bill Requiring Presidential Tax Returns for Primary Ballot\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly signed a bill that requires presidential candidates to publish their tax returns in order to appear on the state's primary ballot. The bill, SB 27, is primarily aimed at President Donald Trump, who has not published his tax returns.\n\nThe bill, which passed both houses of the California state legislature earlier this month, awaits Newsom's signature by the Tuesday deadline. Analysts describe it as a political \"freebie\" for Newsom, but it could be declared unconstitutional, and it could jeopardize the few areas in which Trump has cooperated with Newsom's administration.\n\nThe move is likely to face legal challenges, and it could strain California's already precarious relationship with the Trump administration. Jay Sekulow, a personal attorney for President Trump, suggested legal action will be taken in response to the move by Newsom. \"The state of California's attempt to circumvent the Constitution will be answered in court,\" Sekulow stated.\n\nThough the Golden State has often sued the Trump administration over its policies, California is also dependent on federal aid in several areas. Earlier this year, Trump canceled nearly $1 billion of funds for California's now-defunct high-speed rail project, which Newsom had still hoped to use despite canceling the project.\n\nNewsom shared his own tax returns during the 2018 race for governor. The bill will largely be symbolic, as it will not matter if Trump does not appear on the California primary ballot, as he will still appear on the ballot in the general election. California exempts the presidential primary from its usual \"jungle primary\" process, in which only the top two candidates advance to the general election, regardless of party.\n\nThe bill could, however, inspire other Democrat-governed states to do the same. It will likely boost Newsom's national profile as well. Joel B. Pollak, Senior Editor-at-Large at \u2588\u2588\u2588, notes that Newsom's predecessor, Jerry Brown, did not publish his tax returns. The bill's impact on the 2024 presidential race remains to be seen.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows in July, but Economy Adds 1.5 Million Jobs Over Past Six Months\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, according to a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. This figure is a slight decrease from the 298,000 jobs added in June, but the broader trend remains \"respectable,\" economists said.\n\nOver the past six months, the economy has added 1.5 million jobs, marking the strongest six-month hiring period since 2006. Heidi Shierholz, economist for the Economic Policy Institute, commented, \"We're not losing ground. We're still in a recovery, but we're not seeing a big acceleration in job growth, either. We're back to the solid, but not stellar growth.\"\n\nThe unemployment rate ticked up to 6.2% in July from 6.1% in June as more workers joined the labor force. Since the 2008 financial crisis, about 8.7 million American jobs were wiped out, but the economy has regained them all earlier this year.\n\nBlue-collar industries like manufacturing and construction were the hardest-hit sectors in the recession, and those jobs have started to return. Manufacturers have added 99,000 jobs over the past six months, while construction firms have added 114,000 jobs since January. Meanwhile, government jobs are starting to come back slowly as well.\n\nHowever, stronger hiring has yet to translate into bigger paychecks for most workers. The average American wage edged up only 1 cent in July to $24.45 an hour. Over the past 12 months, wages rose 2%, but that's not enough to surpass inflation.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has stated that she wants to see wages rise faster than inflation so American households will have more buying power. That has yet to happen, but the Fed is quickly nearing its other goals for a lower unemployment rate and stable prices. The central bank is gradually winding down its stimulative policies, and investors have become increasingly focused on trying to gauge when the Fed will eventually hike interest rates.\n\nFriday's jobs report does not significantly impact the Fed's decision-making, and stocks were flat in morning trading. Many Americans still think the economy is not fully recovered. According to a CNN/ORC International poll released Friday, 41% of people surveyed rate the economy as \"good,\" while 58% rate the economy as \"poor.\"\n\nThese perceptions about the economy will be a key factor in November's midterm elections, as more than a third of the Senate and the entire House are up for grabs. Both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for holding back the recovery.\n\nSecretary of Labor Tom Perez stated, \"There are a lot of things that can be done on a bipartisan basis.\" He points to the Obama administration's push to raise the minimum wage, pass an immigration reform bill, and approve funding for infrastructure. Meanwhile, the GOP points fingers at the Democratic-controlled Senate for blocking their job-creation bills, including legislation that would build the Keystone Pipeline.\n\nBoth sides agree on one thing: \"When I look at this report, I think one thing: we can do better,\" House Speaker John Boehner said.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Declines to Reinstate Pennsylvania's Gerrymandered Congressional Maps\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has declined to reinstate Pennsylvania's gerrymandered congressional maps, marking the first time the high court has turned away such a case since the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, who solidified a Republican majority on the court.\n\nIn January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state's congressional maps due to their violation of the state constitution. The unconstitutional maps, which were so aggressively gerrymandered that Republicans won 13 of the state's 18 congressional districts in 2012 despite Democrats winning a majority of the popular vote, should have been the final word on the case.\n\nHowever, Pennsylvania Republicans took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court with a legal theory that argues the state supreme court's decision was unconstitutional because a court is not a legislature. The Constitution states that \"the times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has previously rejected this reading of the word \"legislature.\" In its 2015 decision in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, the court held that redistricting can be determined by a referendum and that the governor may veto state redistricting legislation, even though the governor is not a member of a state's legislative branch.\n\nTaken together, these cases establish that when the Constitution assigns the power to draw districts to the \"legislature,\" it refers to the state's valid lawmaking process, not necessarily to the body of lawmakers elected by the people.\n\nNevertheless, Arizona State Legislature was a 5-4 decision, with four Republicans arguing that the word \"legislature\" can only refer to a state's legislative branch. The Court's fifth Republican, Justice Anthony Kennedy, crossed over to vote with the court's four Democrats in Arizona State Legislature. However, Kennedy is no longer on the court, and his replacement, Brett Kavanaugh, is a hardline conservative who appeared to call for revenge against Democrats during his confirmation hearing.\n\nAt the very least, however, Kavanaugh will not be able to take his revenge in this particular case. The Court's decision not to hear Turzai suggests that, at the very least, Republicans don't have the votes to reinstate one of the nation's most egregious gerrymanders.",
    " Title: House of Representatives Approves Coronavirus Response Package in Bipartisan Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 363-40 vote early Saturday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a coronavirus response package negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. All House Democrats supported the plan, while 40 Republicans opposed it. Independent Representative Justin Amash from Michigan, a former Republican, voted \"present.\"\n\nThe bill, known as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, includes provisions for free coronavirus testing for all who need it, paid sick leave, and expanded unemployment insurance. The bill also includes nutrition security initiatives, increased federal funds for Medicaid, and support for local, state, tribal, and territorial governments and health systems.\n\nThe apparent problems caught Democrats by surprise, with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., saying \"we thought we had an agreement.\" However, the deal was not finalized until shortly before 10 p.m. ET on Friday, when Pelosi informed her Democratic caucus that the \"process has taken some time.\"\n\nPresident Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak on Friday and announced partnerships with major U.S. companies to expand testing capabilities. Trump tweeted his support for the bill on Friday night, encouraging all Republicans and Democrats to vote \"yes.\"\n\nThe Senate is expected to take up the measure next week if it passes the House with an overwhelming majority. The revisions to the Democratic bill happened after the GOP flagged \"major\" concerns about the sick leave legislation on Thursday. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., criticized the initial legislation for creating a paid sick leave program through the Social Security Administration that he said would take six months to set up and hamper the agency's normal functioning of disbursing checks to senior citizens.\n\nMcCarthy also objected to forcing permanent paid sick leave \"for all businesses without exemptions and no sunsets.\" Late Friday, McCarthy told reporters the bill \"had some things which needed to be cleaned up.\"\n\nThe bill is the first major piece of legislation in response to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States. The bill's passage in the House marks a bipartisan effort to address the growing public health and economic crisis caused by the virus. The bill now moves to the Senate for further action.",
    " Title: Grassley Meets with Merrick Garland: A Breakfast Discussion on Supreme Court Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, met with Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court, for breakfast in the Senate Dining Room on Tuesday. The meeting followed a series of town halls in Iowa where Grassley faced criticism from constituents over his refusal to hold confirmation hearings for Garland.\n\nDuring the meeting, Grassley reportedly explained his reasons for not holding hearings for Garland, citing the Senate's role in the confirmation process and the upcoming presidential election. The New York Times reported that Grassley ordered oatmeal while Garland had eggs and toast.\n\nThe meeting, which was described as pleasant by some media outlets, was seen as a rare instance of bipartisan dialogue in a contentious political climate. However, some critics have questioned the purpose of the meeting, given that the Republican-led Senate has maintained a stance of not considering any Supreme Court nominee during an election year.\n\nThe meeting comes as the GOP faces pressure from both within and outside the party. Some Republicans, including Grassley, have faced criticism for their stance on the Supreme Court nomination, with some polls suggesting that the public disapproves of the obstructionism. The GOP also faces a challenging midterm election cycle, with several vulnerable seats up for re-election in purple and blue states.\n\nGrassley's meeting with Garland can be seen as a compromise, allowing the nominee a face-to-face discussion while maintaining the Senate's position of not holding confirmation hearings. It remains to be seen whether this approach will be enough to appease both the GOP base and the general public. As of now, Grassley's poll numbers in Iowa have not significantly dropped, and he was re-elected to the Senate in 2016. However, the situation is evolving, and the outcome of the midterm elections will provide further insight into the public's opinion on the Supreme Court nomination and the GOP's stance on the issue.",
    " Title: NASCAR Bans Confederate Flag, Faces Enforcement Challenges and Celebrity Support\n\nArticle:\n\nNASCAR's decision to ban the Confederate flag from its races and venues has garnered praise from celebrities such as Reese Witherspoon and New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara. The stock car series, known for its Southern roots, is now faced with the challenge of enforcing the ban at its tracks as fans return.\n\nApproximately 1,000 members of the military will be allowed into Sunday's race near Miami, marking the first fans at a NASCAR event since the pandemic shut down sports in March. Enforcement of the ban is expected to be a significant challenge, especially at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama, where up to 5,000 fans are expected to be allowed in. Flags are a common sight at the superspeedway.\n\nNASCAR executive vice president Steve O' Donnell stated that the series will work to develop protocols around enforcement, though the extent of the ban remains unclear. It is not known whether security will be tasked with policing every Rebel flag string bikini or scraping off all bumper stickers.\n\nBubba Wallace, NASCAR's lone black driver, is credited for pushing for the ban. Wallace, who finished 11th at Martinsville on Wednesday night, driving a Black Lives Matter paint scheme, has been praised for his efforts.\n\nJoey Logano, the 2018 NASCAR champion, commended Wallace, stating, \"He should be proud of the movement he\u2019s made for the African-American community in our sport.\" Brad Daugherty, the lone black Cup Series team owner, expressed his support for the ban, stating, \"This is a big step in the right direction and now is the time to envision the future.\"\n\nThere have been fans who are furious at the decision, with some taking to social media to express their displeasure. NASCAR helmet artist Jason Beam, who designs helmets for Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Busch, and other star drivers, has expressed opposition to the ban. Wallace and several drivers, including Johnson, have cut ties with Beam Designs as a result.\n\nNASCAR has been one of the only live U.S. sports on television during the pandemic, and ratings are up slightly in this most unusual of seasons.

    " Title: New NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll Reveals Slight Increase in Approval Rating for President Obama, Mixed Views on Economy and Health Care\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 44% of Americans approve of President Barack Obama's job performance, while 50% disapprove. This represents a slight uptick from his all-time low 41% approval rating in the poll last month.\n\nThe poll indicates that majorities of Americans do not approve of how President Obama is handling the economy (52%) and foreign policy (53%). However, for the first time since early October, more people have a positive view of the president (44%) than a negative one (41%).\n\nThe poll also reveals that a majority of registered voters (55%) believe the economy is stacked against people like them, and a majority of Americans (54%) say that because of a widening income gap, America is no longer a country where, regardless of their background, people have an opportunity to improve their standard of living.\n\nRegarding the economy, a plurality of respondents (47% to 39%) say the current economic conditions are something President Obama inherited as opposed to something his policies are mostly responsible for. Forty-one percent believe that the economy has improved during his presidency, with 17% saying the economy has improved but do not give him much credit, and 42% saying the economy has not really improved.\n\nIn terms of health care, 36% of voters say President Obama's health care law was a good idea, while 46% say it was a bad idea. However, just about one-fifth of voters (20%) say the law should be completely repealed. Two-thirds of voters (66%) say it needs a major overhaul or minor modifications to improve it, and 8% think it's working well the way it is.\n\nAs for the midterm elections, 45% of registered voters prefer a Republican-controlled Congress, and 45% prefer a Democratic-controlled one. Forty-two percent of those polled identified with the Democratic party in some form, 34% identified with the Republican party, and 17% said they were independent.\n\nThe poll of 1,000 adults taken from April 23-27 has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",
    " Title: Conservative Parties Grapple with Economic Inequality and Social Disintegration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political landscape in several industrialized nations is undergoing a significant shift, with conservative parties attempting to navigate the challenges of economic inequality and social disintegration. The recent electoral setbacks for right-leaning parties, such as the failure of Theresa May's post-Brexit election gamble and the re-election of Angela Merkel, have led some to question the effectiveness of the conservative approach.\n\nIn the United States, the election of Donald Trump has not resulted in the revolution some of his supporters anticipated. Instead, his administration has been marked by political incompetence and a lack of a clear plan for addressing economic issues. In the United Kingdom, the Brexit process is stalling due to incompetent and convictionless politicians who have failed to negotiate effectively, potentially leading to a \"no deal\" exit from the European Union.\n\nOne potential savior for the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom is Ruth Davidson, the leader of Scotland's Conservative and Unionist party. Davidson, who is openly lesbian, has been credited with resurrecting her party from the grave following May's loss of the Tories' working majority. However, Davidson's recent political essay suggests that she may not be the answer to Mayism, as she calls for a reboot of capitalism to address the economic and social issues that have led to the rise of right-wing parties.\n\nIn her essay, Davidson argues that capitalism must be a moral enterprise that reaches out to those who have been left behind by the economy. She cites Adam Smith's contention that capitalism can provide the means for public services and praises \"intervention, market restraints, and decisions made at a macro-level by governments to ensure basic fairness for the little guy.\" Davidson acknowledges the same problems that have been cited by May, Trump, and other right-wing dissidents, including the difficulty of finding work and the sense of helplessness felt by those who can no longer afford homeownership.\n\nThe challenges facing conservative parties and thinkers are not unique to any one nation. In many industrialized countries, the middle class is slipping away, and traditional social supports such as family, community, union, and church are disintegrating or becoming irrelevant. To these people, capitalism does not look like an opportunity; it looks like an opportunity to be fleeced.\n\nWhile May and Trump may fail, it is likely that conservative parties and conservative thinkers will continue to grapple with these issues for the foreseeable future. The solutions may not be clear yet, but the problems do not appear to be going away anytime soon.",

The @nytimes should be ashamed and so should the person who wrote the false, illogical, and gutless op-ed. Our office is above such amateur acts.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, during a trip to India, told reporters, \"It's not mine,\" and denounced The New York Times for publishing the anonymous article that suggests Trump may be facing a potential revolt within his own administration.\n\nThe op-ed, titled \"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,\" was written by an anonymous senior Trump official who stated that staff members are working to block what they perceive as bad decisions by the president, on issues ranging from free trade to military policy.\n\nThe author describes Trump as unprincipled and \"amoral,\" stating that meetings with him often veer off topic and result in half-baked, ill-informed, and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back. The piece compares Trump unfavorably to the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., described as a \"lodestar for restoring honor to public life and our national dialogue.\"\n\nTrump has questioned the legitimacy of the anonymous author, tweeting, \"Does the so-called 'Senior Administration Official' really exist, or is it just the Failing New York Times with another phony source? If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders stated, \"The coward who wrote the piece should step forward and resign, saying he is not putting country first, but putting himself and his ego ahead of the will of the American people.\"",
    " Title: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Issues Final Rules on Sexual Misconduct Allegations in Schools\n\nArticle:\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos has issued final rules on how schools will address allegations of sexual misconduct, securing new protections for students and faculty accused of misconduct. The new rules, which take effect in August, modify Title IX, a 1972 law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance.\n\nThe new regulations narrow the definition of sexual harassment and require schools to challenge evidence and cross-examine students via a live hearing, among other things detailed in the more than 2,000-page rule. The new regulations will only find schools in violation of Title IX if they are determined to be \"deliberately indifferent\" to accusations of sexual assault that occurred in their programs and activities.\n\nPresident Trump described the new regulations as \"even-handed justice\" with \"a transparent grievance process that treats the accused as innocent until proven guilty.\" In a statement, DeVos said, \"Too many students have lost access to their education because their school inadequately responded when a student filed a complaint of sexual harassment or sexual assault.\"\n\nVictim advocacy groups, such as Know Your IX, have criticized the new rules, claiming they roll back the rights of student survivors and shield schools from liability for sexual misconduct that takes place in their facilities. The National Women's Law Center plans to contest the new rules in court, according to The New York Times.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Education Committee, praised the new rules, stating, \"Under the previous administration, a single official in the U.S. Department of Education was issuing edicts, without the proper public input, to 6,000 colleges and universities about how to handle the complex and sensitive problem of sexual assault on college campuses.\"",
    " Title: High School Shooter in Maryland Killed by Police Officer After Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nA 17-year-old gunman, identified as Austin Wyatt Rollins, shot and injured two teenage students at Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County, Maryland, before being shot dead in a gunfight with a police officer. The incident occurred on Tuesday morning before the start of lessons.\n\nRollins shot a 16-year-old girl, who is currently in critical condition, and a 14-year-old boy. The attack took place in a hallway at the school, according to Sheriff Tim Cameron.\n\nCameron stated that Rollins had a prior relationship with the girl. The school shooting occurred a month after a high school shooter killed 17 in Parkland, Florida.\n\nSt. Mary's County Sheriff's Deputy Blaine Gaskill, who was assigned to the school as a resource officer, exchanged gunfire with the attacker. It is unclear if the gunman was hit by Gaskill's gunfire or if he shot himself during the exchange.\n\nThe female student is in critical condition in the hospital. Some 1,600 students attend the school in the community of Great Mills near the Chesapeake Bay and were evacuated to a nearby school after the event.\n\nFederal agents from the FBI and the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, along with local police, are at the school investigating the incident. One Twitter user, who appears to be a student at the school, posted about the shootings.\n\nMaryland Governor Larry Hogan has expressed concern, stating, \"Today's horrible events should not be an excuse to pause our conversation about school safety.\" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also commented, calling the attack \"another tragic and exasperating reminder of the enduring threat of gun violence\" and urging \"our so-called leaders in Washington\" to take action to stem gun attacks.\n\nThe shooting occurs four days before the March for Our Lives rally for student safety, inspired by the 14 February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in southern Florida.",
    " Title: Treasury Department Delays Employer Mandate in Affordable Care Act by One Year\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Treasury Department announced on Tuesday that the requirement for businesses to provide health insurance to their employees or face fines, a key provision of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA), will be delayed by one year. The delay comes in response to concerns expressed by business owners about the complexity of the law's reporting requirements.\n\nUnder the ACA, businesses employing 50 or more full-time workers that do not provide health insurance will be penalized. Mark J. Mazur, assistant secretary for tax policy, wrote in a post on the Treasury Department's website that the extra year before the requirement goes into effect will allow the government time to simplify the reporting process for businesses. Penalties for firms not providing health coverage to employees will now begin in 2015, after next year's congressional elections.\n\nThe new delay will not affect other aspects of the health law, including the establishment of exchanges in states for low-income Americans to obtain health insurance.\n\nSupporters of the employer mandate argue that most firms already provide health insurance to full-time workers, and downplay the effect the requirement would have on small businesses, citing figures showing the vast majority of small businesses employ fewer than 50 workers.\n\nHowever, opponents claim the employer mandate is a potential job killer, stating that businesses near the 50-worker cutoff will be unlikely to ramp up hiring if it means they are required to provide employees health insurance.\n\nThe Obama administration has previously expressed openness to making the health care law easier to implement, and has already shortened applications for health insurance on government-run exchanges from 21 pages to three.\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama's senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, who acts as the White House's liaison to big business, wrote the new delay was indicative of the administration's determination to implement the health care law effectively and fairly, and that it wouldn't affect other aspects of Obamacare.\n\nHowever, many Republicans, and even some Democrats, have continued to express serious concerns about the roll-out of Obamacare. On Tuesday, GOP lawmakers said the delay of the employer mandate didn't go far enough.\n\n\"This announcement means even the Obama administration knows the 'train wreck' will only get worse,\" House Speaker John Boehner wrote. \"Obamacare costs too much and it isn't working the way the administration promised,\" Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, wrote in response to the decision, adding, \"The fact remains that Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced with common-sense reforms that actually lower costs for Americans.\"\n\nRep. Eric Cantor, the House Majority Leader, was more succinct. \"The best delay for Obamacare is a permanent one,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nMany allies of Obama, including major labor unions, did not immediately weigh in on the delay. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in response to the decision, \"Flexibility is a good thing.\"\n\n\"Both the administration and Senate Democrats have shown \u2013 and continue to show \u2013 a willingness to be flexible and work with all interested parties to make sure that implementation of the Affordable Care Act is as beneficial as possible to all involved. It is better to do this right than fast,\" Adam Jentleson continued.\n\nEven some Democrats have voiced concern about the roll-out of the health law \u2013 Sen. Max Baucus, a key Democrat who helped craft the legislation, expressed serious anxiety in April about its implementation.\n\n\"The administration's public information campaign on the benefits of the Affordable Care Act deserves a failing grade. You need to fix this,\" Baucus told Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a hearing.\n\n\"I just see a huge train wreck coming down,\" he added later.",
    " Title: President Trump Fires FBI Director James Comey\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump terminated FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, citing a need for new leadership to restore public trust and confidence in the law enforcement agency. The decision was based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nIn a letter to Comey, Trump stated that the FBI director could not \"effectively lead\" the bureau. The White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, confirmed that the president's decision was based on the \"clear recommendations\" of Sessions and Rosenstein.\n\nThe search for a new permanent FBI director will begin immediately, with Andrew McCabe, the bureau's deputy director, assuming the position of acting director. The White House made the announcement shortly after the FBI corrected a sentence in Comey's sworn testimony on Capitol Hill last week.\n\nThe FBI clarified that only a small number of the thousands of emails found on the laptop of Huma Abedin, a top aide to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, had been forwarded there, while most had simply been backed up from electronic devices. This error was apparently unrelated to the Comey firing.\n\nComey, who was nominated by President Barack Obama for the FBI post in 2013 to a 10-year term, first ran into problems during the 2016 presidential race when he tried to conclude his investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private server system for emails while at the State Department. He concluded that Clinton, then the Democratic presidential nominee, had not acted criminally with classified emails but said she had been \u201cextremely careless.\u201d\n\nHe then announced a revived probe regarding the emails and Abedin\u2019s handling of them in the closing days of the race. Clinton has said that this largely contributed to her loss to Trump, while Comey has defended his actions.\n\nThe FBI and other members of the U.S. intelligence community, as well as Congress, are now investigating the extent to which Russia was involved in stealing and making public emails from Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said Comey had lost the \"public trust and confidence.\" He also said Comey's decisions on controversial matters, including the Clinton email matter, \"have prompted concern from across the political spectrum\" and from career law enforcement experts.\n\nDemocrats are further insisting on an independent prosecutor to investigate possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia, following the firing. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, \"The only way the American people can have faith in this investigation is for it to be led by a fearless special prosecutor.\"",
    " Title: Mail-In Voting: A Divisive Issue Amidst National Election\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tweets expressing opposition towards mail-in voting have sparked a partisan divide on the issue at a national level. However, most local election officials, regardless of party affiliation, acknowledge the necessity of increased mail-in voting, despite the associated challenges. According to recent surveys, most voters agree with the need to reduce voter density on Election Day and during early voting, with an expansion of mail balloting considered essential for this purpose.\n\nDespite the growing acceptance of mail-in voting, Americans value safe polling places in November. Voter behavior is resistant to change, with many Americans having voted in person throughout their adult lives. Some view in-person voting as an expression of civic pride and duty, while others distrust the postal system to deliver their ballot or have been influenced by Trump's criticism and choose not to vote by mail. Individuals with disabilities or those requiring language assistance may find in-person voting more convenient.\n\nIn a survey of registered voters in Pennsylvania, approximately half indicated they would vote in person in the fall. Even among primary voters who cast a mail ballot, 20% said they were likely to vote in person during the general election. Most of those who did not vote in the primary but plan to vote in November intend to do so in person.\n\nFor new or infrequent voters, certain aspects of absentee voting may be unfamiliar. They may encounter difficulties navigating websites to request a ballot or be surprised by the requirement to sign the outside envelope for verification purposes. In recent New Jersey elections, for example, as many as 10% of ballots were not counted due to lateness or technical deficiencies. Mail-in voting procedures can trip up some groups more than others. An analysis of data from Florida revealed that African Americans, young people, and first-time voters were less likely to have their mail ballots counted due to lateness or noncompliance with technical requirements.\n\nElection Day polling places serve as an indispensable fail-safe for voters who do not receive their mail ballots on time. During the primary season, jurisdictions with limited experience in voting by mail have been overwhelmed by the number of mail ballots that need to be processed. In Wisconsin earlier this year, for example, more than 10,000 voters requested absentee ballots that they never received. A local federal judge extended the deadline for casting these ballots, but his decision was overturned the day before the election by a narrow majority of the United States Supreme Court. This left voters without mail ballots in a precarious position, as those who never received mail ballots now had to wait in long lines in places such as Milwaukee, which opened only five polling locations.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Case Challenges Internet Sales Tax Exemption for Out-of-State Companies\n\nArticle:\n\nA Supreme Court case, South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., is currently under review, addressing the issue of state and local governments' ability to collect sales taxes from out-of-state companies. The case aims to overturn a 1992 Supreme Court decision, Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, which established that a business must have a significant presence in a state before that state can require it to collect sales taxes.\n\nUnder the current ruling, a small-scale online seller, such as an individual selling handcrafted goods on Etsy, does not have to collect sales taxes from consumers unless they are physically located in the same state. However, large companies like Amazon collect sales taxes from customers in all 45 states with a statewide sales tax due to their extensive distribution networks.\n\nMany state lawmakers are advocating for the overturning of Quill, which would allow them to force out-of-state companies to collect sales taxes on their behalf. If the states were to win, they would be able to impose taxes on the small-scale online seller, even if they reside in a different state, have not elected the state's officials, and have not agreed to the state's tax laws.\n\nThe potential overturning of Quill could also lead to the loss of tax competition among states. Under the new regime, online consumers, regardless of their location or purchases, would lose the ability to shop around for a more favorable tax system. This competitive pressure, which limits state tax-grabbing abilities, is what lawmakers resent and want the Supreme Court to eliminate.\n\nSome lawmakers may hope that increased revenue would alleviate their financial issues. However, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 33 states faced shortfalls in fiscal 2017 and/or fiscal 2018, despite revenue collection growth in most states. This is because the more states collect in revenue, the more they spend.\n\nFurthermore, states may be overestimating the revenue they would receive from taxes on internet sales. Online sales represent less than 10% of retail sales, according to a 2017 report by the Government Accountability Office. Additionally, the 100 largest online retailers already tax approximately 90% of their sales. Desperate lawmakers should not expect to collect more than 2-4% of total state and local government tax revenues this way, according to the GAO, if Quill were to be reversed.\n\nA reversal of Quill could also impose significant compliance costs on small online retailers, which typically have thin profit margins. Compliance with the nation's 12,000 tax-collecting jurisdictions could be costly, and tax software may not be precise enough to handle the complexity of taxation on a case-by-case basis.\n\nRepublican state senator Deb Peters of South Dakota, in an interview with NPR on the morning of the South Dakota v. Wayfair hearing, dismissed concerns about compliance costs. According to Peters, free software provided by most desperate states would make the cost zero. However, this is questionable, as noted by an eBay representative on NPR, who pointed out that tax laws vary significantly between states, and compliance would still require extensive effort.\n\nThe Wayfair case has much at stake. If Quill were to be overturned, compliance costs could skyrocket for many retailers, and good principles of taxation could be discarded. Healthy tax competition is at risk. Let's hope the Supreme Court makes the right decision.",

    " Title: House Democrats Announce Articles of Impeachment Against President Trump and USMCA Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Tuesday, House Democrats unveiled two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump and announced they had reached an agreement with the White House on a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\nThe impeachment charges, which accuse the president of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, were announced solemnly, but the mood shifted an hour later when Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the USMCA, which she said Democrats took \"great pride in.\" The deal, which includes various environmental and labor regulations, is expected to be signed by Mexico and Canada in the coming days.\n\nPresident Trump took a break from his impeachment-related tweets to promote the deal, stating, \"Looking like very good Democrat support for USMCA. That would be great for our Country!\"\n\nSpeaker Pelosi told reporters that the timing of both developments was not under the control of Democrats. The impeachment hearings concluded on Monday, making it logical to unveil the articles of impeachment on Tuesday, she said. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has led the USMCA negotiations, wanted to finalize the NAFTA replacement before Congress goes on recess and while Democrats and Republicans remain on the same page.\n\nBehind closed doors, Pelosi insisted that Democrats had the upper hand in the trade deal and outmaneuvered the GOP. \"We ate their lunch,\" Pelosi reportedly said in a caucus meeting.\n\nSupporters of Pelosi and more moderate Democrats praised the one-two punch of impeachment and the trade deal, arguing that Democrats needed to demonstrate their ability to \"walk and chew gum at the same time.\" However, many progressives criticized the strategy, arguing that the USMCA undermined the party's case for impeachment.\n\nAdam Serwer, a writer for The Atlantic, stated, \"Either the Republic is in danger and impeachment is necessary, or it's not that big a deal and congress can do business as usual.\" Will Stancil, a researcher at the University of Minnesota Law School, called Pelosi's strategy \"insane.\"\n\nSome critics argued that Democrats were fulfilling the \"Dems in disarray\" stereotype and mistakenly trying to appease voters in swing states. Chris Hayes, the progressive MSNBC host, tweeted, \"Nothing more perfectly embodies the Democratic party than announcing articles of impeachment and a huge deal with the President on his single biggest priority on the same day.\"\n\nBrian Beutler, the editor-in-chief of the progressive media outlet Crooked Media, called Pelosi's strategy \"a stunning betrayal.\" Beutler tweeted, \"If you kill the deal, you can say it was a shitty deal, like everything else Trump has done and that you'll do better.

    " Title: Romney's Favorability Rating Surpasses 50% Following Debate Performances\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has surpassed a significant milestone in his favorability rating, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls. As of early this week, Romney's favorability rating briefly exceeded 50%, marking the first time he has led President Obama in this measure.\n\nThe debates, particularly the first one, have reportedly dismantled President Obama's strategy of portraying Romney as an unacceptable choice for voters. According to Republican pollster Mike McKenna, the debates \"destroyed the Obama campaign's strategy of disqualification.\"\n\nPrior to the debates, Romney's favorability rating was 44.5%. By Monday, when he and Obama faced off for the third and final time, Romney's rating had risen to 50.5%. Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm, described the surge in Romney's favorability as \"remarkable.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday, Romney's favorability rating had dipped below 50% again, but he still leads Obama in net favorability, a calculation of favorable rating minus unfavorable rating. Obama's favorability averaged 49.7%, or 4.5 points more than his unfavorable rating, while Romney's favorability was 49.3%, or 6.5 points more than his unfavorable rating.\n\nDuring the foreign policy-focused debate on Tuesday, Romney maintained a measured performance, although pundits criticized him for not presenting clear differences with Obama on world hot spots. However, Republicans argued that Romney succeeded in presenting himself as a palatable alternative to Obama.\n\nIn the final two weeks of the campaign, the election has once again become a referendum on President Obama. Obama, in his closing remarks during Monday's debate, emphasized his administration's progress in addressing economic and foreign policy challenges, while criticizing Romney's proposed policies.\n\nThe debates' impact on Romney's favorability rating is a significant development in the race, according to pollster John Zogby. \"Voters got to see an option. Now that there is an option, Romney is viewed as favorably as Obama as a person,\" he said. However, Romney still faces challenges in terms of relatability, as indicated by a recent poll showing Obama nearly doubling Romney's likability rating.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 113,000 Jobs in January, Unemployment Rate at 6.6%\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy added 113,000 jobs in January, according to the government, marking a slight improvement from the previous month but falling short of economists' expectations. The addition of jobs was far weaker than anticipated, with experts predicting an increase of 178,000 jobs.\n\nEconomists described the report as \"disappointing\" and \"weak,\" but characterized the broader economic growth as \"steady-as-she-goes.\" Julia Coronado, chief economist, North America for BNP Paribas, stated, \"The U.S. economy is very stable. 2014 might not be a breakout year, but it's not a disaster either.\"\n\nMany economists had hoped that December's weak job gains would be significantly revised higher, as many experts considered the December report a fluke. However, the number was revised higher, but only by 1,000 jobs to 75,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate was 6.6% in January, with 10 million Americans counted as unemployed. The unemployment rate has improved substantially since it peaked at 10% in 2009 and is now at its lowest level in more than five years.\n\nHowever, much of the decline in unemployment is due to Americans dropping out of the labor force. As of January, only 63% of Americans over age 16 participated in the labor market, meaning they either had a job or looked for one. Although there was a slight improvement in January, participation is still hovering around its lowest level since 1978.\n\nWhile some of the decline is partly due to baby boomers retiring, economists are also concerned about the long-term unemployed, who may be giving up on the job market altogether. Following the report, one of President Obama's top economic advisers, Jason Furman, called the unemployment rate \"unacceptably high.\"\n\nAbout 3.6 million Americans have been unemployed for six months or more. Those who were relying on extended government benefits lost that lifeline in December.\n\n\"These figures provide a stark reminder that despite the progress that has been made, the after-effects of the recession still linger and are creating hardship for many families,\" Furman wrote in a White House blog post.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been stressing that its stimulus policies depend on the economic data. While it has been aiming for an unemployment rate of 6.5%, it's expected to distance itself from using that number as its main measure of the job market.\n\n\"Using the narrow, widely reported unemployment rate alone could suggest a misleadingly optimistic state of affairs,\" Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in a prepared speech Thursday, ahead of the jobs report.\n\nRecently appointed Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to testify before two Congressional committees next week.\n\nSurprisingly, more than half of January's job gains came from traditional blue-collar sectors. Goods-producing industries added more jobs than the services sector for the first time since 2005. Construction firms added 48,000 jobs, manufacturers added 21,000 jobs, and the mining industry added 7,200 jobs.\n\nHowever, that was one of few bright spots in the report. The health care sector cut 400 jobs\u2014the first month of job losses since 2003. Health care had been an industry with strong job growth throughout the recession. Professional and business services added 36,000 jobs, but a large part of those jobs were through staffing agencies. About 15,000 jobs were added at restaurants and bars. Sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores cut 22,000 jobs.\n\nOverall, the U.S. economy lost 8.7 million jobs in the financial crisis. As of January, 7.8 million jobs have come back, but once economists also account for population growth, they expect that it will still take years to get back to a pre-recession job market.",
    " Title: Donald Trump Reverses Pledge to Support GOP Nominee: A Look at the Reasons Behind the Change\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has reversed his pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee, a promise he made during the party's primary debates in August. In a recent interview with CNN, Trump stated, \"No, I do not anymore.\"\n\nDuring the debates, all Republican candidates, including Trump, had pledged to support the nominee, even if it was not themselves. However, Trump was the only candidate who refused to make this pledge, citing leverage and the need to maintain control over the nomination process.\n\nAfter meeting with Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, Trump signed a pledge to support the GOP nominee. However, on Tuesday, Trump changed his stance once again, citing unfair treatment from the Republican National Committee and the \"Republican Party establishment.\"\n\nThe change in Trump's stance comes as the finish line for the Republican primary race is in sight. With the active \"stop-Trump\" or #NeverTrump effort aiming to prevent Trump from reaching the 1,237 delegates needed to become the GOP nominee, Trump believes this effort is not fair, as he currently leads in the delegate count.\n\nThe rules of the Republican primary process state that the candidate with a majority of delegates, which is 50% plus one of the total number of voting delegates to the Republican National Convention (2,472), will be the nominee. Trump has criticized the number 1,237 as \"very random\" but it is, in fact, the majority required to secure the nomination.\n\nTrump's strong and devoted following among a significant chunk of GOP primary voters is his biggest piece of leverage. In the past, Trump has threatened to run as a third-party candidate when he felt unfairly treated, and this threat has been effective in the past. Now, as the \"stop-Trump\" effort gains traction, Trump is using this leverage to pressure the party to back off.\n\nThe implications of Trump's decision to reverse his pledge to support the GOP nominee remain unclear, but it is certain that this decision will have a significant impact on the Republican primary race and the party's chances in the general election.",
    " Title: Attorney General Sessions Indicates Willingness to Recuse Himself from Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has stated that he would recuse himself from any investigation involving Russian involvement in President Trump's campaign if it is \"appropriate.\" In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Sessions said, \"I have said whenever it's appropriate, I will recuse myself.\"\n\nReports emerged Wednesday that Sessions spoke twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential race. During his confirmation hearings for attorney general, Sessions testified under oath that he \"did not have communications with the Russians.\"\n\nIn his comments with NBC News, Sessions defended himself, stating, \"I have not met with any Russians at any time to discuss any political campaigns.\" He added, \"Those remarks are unbelievable to me and are false. I don\u2019t have anything else to say about that.\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) suggested Thursday that Sessions recusing himself from any Russia-related investigations would be \"easier.\" McCarthy said, \"I do not have all the information in front of me, I do not want to pre-judge, but I just think for any investigation going forward, you want to make sure everybody trusts the investigation.\"\n\nThe FBI is reportedly investigating contact between Russian officials and members of the Trump campaign, though there have yet to be any formal charges brought. Committees in the House and Senate are also pursuing their own investigations.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Wednesday that if the FBI finds any criminal activity related to campaign aides' alleged contact with Russian officials, then a special prosecutor will likely be needed. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) said he wished Sessions had been \"more clear\" during the confirmation process about his meetings.\n\nSessions, a former Republican senator from Alabama, reportedly spoke with Kislyak during a July event at the Republican National Convention and in a September phone call. The conversations took place during a time when U.S. intelligence officials assert that Russia was interfering in the 2016 race through a hacking and influence campaign.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the news about Sessions speaking with Kislyak, arguing that Sessions must recuse himself from any federal investigation into contact between Russia and Trump's team. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for Sessions to resign following the news, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also called for Sessions' resignation, stating that he is \"not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly dismissed the reports of Russia contacts as \"fake news\" and suggested the real issue is leaks of information from the intelligence community. Yet scrutiny of the issue continues to build, particularly after Michael Flynn resigned last month as national security adviser for misleading Vice President Pence about his own phone conversations with Kislyak after the election.",
    " Title: Study Suggests Democratic Party's Leftward Shift Outpaces Republican Rightward Shift in Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by political scientists from Princeton, Georgetown, and the University of Oregon suggests that the Democratic Party's leftward shift may be more pronounced than the Republican Party's rightward shift in political polarization, particularly at the state level. The study, published in August, argues that income inequality has contributed to political polarization at the state level since the 1990s.\n\nThe authors of the study found that political polarization at the state level has increased due to the movement of state Democratic parties to the left rather than the movement of state Republican parties to the right. The Democratic Party's loss of power at the state level over the past 15 years has led to the shedding of its moderate wing, with centrist Democrats losing seats to Republicans, resulting in a more liberal Democratic party overall. The authors note that the ideological median of Republican legislators has shifted less.\n\nWhile the study does not prove a thesis, it aligns with the trends observed in recent years. The findings challenge the conventional wisdom that the Republican Party has been moving farther and farther to the right, causing political polarization and gridlock in Washington, while the Democratic Party has become more moderate and centrist.\n\nThe study's findings are in contrast to the claims made by some Democrats, including President Obama and Hillary Clinton, who have often given the impression that their party is moderate and in line with public opinion, while Republicans have undergone a sudden jolt to the right. However, the study suggests that the narrative of Democratic moderation and Republican extremism may not be entirely accurate.\n\nThe study's findings add to the ongoing debate about political polarization in the United States and the role of income inequality in shaping political ideologies. While the study focuses on the state level, its findings may have implications for the national political landscape as well. The study's authors argue that understanding the causes of political polarization is essential for addressing the issue and promoting a more equitable and functional political system.",
    " Title: Trump Offers Immigration Concessions, Democrats Reject; Shutdown Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Democrats for rejecting his proposals aimed at ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. In a series of tweets, Trump claimed that his offers had been dismissed before he even presented them. The President proposed compromises in exchange for funding for his proposed security wall along the Mexican border, the primary cause of the shutdown.\n\nDemocrats labeled the proposals as \"unacceptable,\" \"a non-starter,\" and \"hostage taking.\" In an address on Saturday, Trump proposed a three-year extension for approximately 700,000 Dreamers, individuals who entered the U.S. illegally as children with their parents, and for 300,000 people holding visas under Temporary Protection Status (TPS), individuals who have fled countries affected by war or disasters.\n\nTrump tweeted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats had \"turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak.\" He accused his opponents of not seeing crime and drugs, but rather focusing on the 2020 election, which they are not expected to win.\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Trump addressed concerns from the conservative right that his immigration offer would amount to an amnesty. He clarified that \"Amnesty is not part of my offer.\" He explained that he was only discussing a three-year extension, with amnesty being a potential part of a larger deal, either on immigration or another issue.\n\nTrump also stated that he was not planning a \"big push to remove 11 million plus people\" in the U.S. illegally, but warned Pelosi to \"be careful\" on that matter. The target of Trump's anger was a statement released by Pelosi anticipating and rejecting the concessions before they were made.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer stated that Trump had previously \"single-handedly\" taken away Dreamer and TPS protections, and offering some protections back was \"not a compromise but more hostage taking.\" The Democrats maintain that they will not negotiate until the government is reopened.\n\nWith the Democrats now in control of the House, while Trump's Republicans still have a majority in the Senate, the federal budget funding must be agreed upon by both parties. Opinion polls suggest most Americans blame Trump more than the Democrats for the shutdown.\n\nAs the shutdown enters its fifth week, some of the 800,000 federal employees who have been going unpaid since 22 December are in increasingly dire straits. More than 1,500 appeals have been set up by them on crowdfunding site GoFundMe, seeking financial assistance to pay rent or feed and clothe their children.",
    " Title: Trump Administration to Allow Additional 30,000 Seasonal Workers through H-2B Visas\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has cleared a rule to issue an additional 30,000 H-2B visas for foreign workers this summer, a higher-than-expected number that reflects internal tensions within the White House regarding legal immigration. The administration had earlier indicated it was considering only an additional 15,000 such visas.\n\nThe H-2B program allows employers to hire foreign workers for seasonal, non-agricultural jobs that they claim they cannot fill with American workers. The annual cap for these visas is 66,000, with 33,000 allocated for summer and 33,000 for winter. Demand for these visas often exceeds the supply.\n\nIn 2017, half of all H-2B visas were granted to agricultural and horticultural industries, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data on approvals. Building and construction, forestry and logging, food services and handlers, helpers and laborers accounted for most of the remaining visas.\n\nThe rule comes amid an ongoing immigration debate within the administration. While some officials, such as Stephen Miller, are pushing for stricter immigration policies, others, including Jared Kushner, are advocating for relaxed rules to facilitate growth in a tight job market. Kushner is reportedly finalizing a legislative proposal to overhaul immigration, which may result in offering a larger number of H-1B visas for high-skilled workers with fewer restrictions.\n\nThe administration has also been investigating companies seen as discriminating against American workers in favor of temporary workers through the Protecting U.S. Workers Initiative. The initiative has reached settlements with several companies for failing to comply with the H-2B program's requirements.\n\nThe debate over low-skilled and high-skilled foreign labor is a contentious issue in Congress, with some lawmakers expressing concerns about the impact of the H-2B visa program on both immigrant and American workers. The future of the H-2B visa program remains uncertain, with some members of Congress advocating for a higher number of visas, while others are calling for a reconsideration of the increase.",
    " Title: Columbia Journalism Review Criticizes Media's Approach to Reporting on President Trump's Truthfulness\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Columbia Journalism Review has criticized the media's approach to reporting on President Donald Trump's truthfulness, arguing that efforts to label him a liar without explicitly doing so undermines journalistic standards and deepens national disarray.\n\nThe Review, a well-known publication that focuses on media analysis, questions the distinction most media institutions have made in referring to Trump as a liar without using the term. The Review highlights the New York Times' approach, such as its headline \"Trump Falsely Says Times Made Up Source in Report on Korea Summit Meeting.\"\n\nThe Review points to White House Reporter Maggie Haberman's tweet, in which she stated that Trump told two demonstrable falsehoods, as an example of journalistic efforts to downplay the President's commitment to truth. The Review also mentions the Times' charge that \"He Uses Conspiracy Theories to Erode Trust.\"\n\nThe Review argues that the media's approach to reporting on Trump's truthfulness is problematic, as it involves telling people what to think rather than presenting facts and allowing the public to make up their own minds. The Review suggests that journalists should present asserations and facts that undermine the Trumpian account, but without indignation or contempt, and allow the White House to answer those sources.\n\nThe Review also questions the media's role in society, stating that they are our eyes and ears, but not our brains. The Review argues that the media's attempts to lead viewers and readers by the nose is a non-fruitful mode of argumentation and discussion.\n\nThe Review concludes by stating that the media's fury at President Trump is sowing worrisome consequences for the future. The Review suggests that the media's angry judgmentalism, its love of crying \"Liar!\", is making things far angrier and more divisive than they are now. The Review also questions the long-term impact of the media's approach to reporting on Trump, suggesting that it may undermine public trust in the media and make it difficult for the media to regain that trust in the future.",
    " Title: Christine Hallquist Becomes First Transgender Candidate to Win Major Party's Nomination for Governor\n\nArticle:\n\nChristine Hallquist, a 62-year-old Democrat, has made history by becoming the first transgender candidate to win a major political party's nomination for governor in the state of Vermont. Hallquist defeated three other Democratic contenders in Tuesday's primary.\n\nHallquist, who is backed by The Victory Fund, a political action committee that supports LGBTQ candidates nationwide, emphasizes her platform, which includes higher wages for state workers, improved healthcare for families, and better education for children.\n\n\"Vermonters are going to elect me on my platform,\" Hallquist said. \"They are not going to elect me because of the fact that I'm transgender\u2014that's the reality.\" She added, \"Obviously, nationwide it's significant, the first transgender governor. It is pioneering.\"\n\nElliot Imse, communications director for The Victory Fund, commented, \"Because she is open and authentic about the fact that she is transgender, that immediately takes away all the questions, all the whispers, and instead allows people to focus on her personality and what she wants to do.\" Imse continued, \"People are liking what they're hearing, and that's what's really cool about Christine.\"\n\nHallquist moved to Vermont in 1976 and worked for the Vermont Electric Co-operative, eventually becoming CEO in 2005. She was open about her 2015 transition and allowed news organizations to document the change. Hallquist stepped down from her position at the co-op earlier this year to run for office, citing Governor Phil Scott's alleged disregard for the interests of rural Vermonters.\n\nIn the primary, Hallquist defeated environmental activist James Ehlers, dance festival organizer Brenda Siegel, and 14-year-old Ethan Sonneborn, who made it onto the ticket due to a loophole in the state law that does not require candidates to be of voting age. If Hallquist wins in November, she would become the nation's first transgender governor.\n\nApproximately 200 LGBT candidates are expected to be on the November ballot across the country for state and federal office, according to The Victory Fund. This represents the most LGBT candidates ever, with notable candidates including Alexandra Chandler, Massachusetts' first openly transgender candidate for Congress, and Kim Coco Iwamoto, who could become Hawaii's first transgender lieutenant governor if elected. Like Hallquist, both Chandler and Iwamoto are Democrats.",
    " Title: U.S. Natural Gas Exporter Excelerate Energy Negotiates Long-Term Contracts for Overseas Shipments\n\nArticle:\n\nExcelerate Energy, a natural gas exporter based in the United States, is in negotiations with several foreign companies to secure long-term contracts for shipping natural gas abroad. The company, which is half-owned by billionaire George B. Kaiser, expects to finalize these agreements by early next year, with the first shipments departing from the Texas coast by 2017.\n\nRob Bryngelson, the 44-year-old chief executive of Excelerate Energy, stated, \"There's so much potential for the U.S. to take advantage of high prices in global markets. We've got to capitalize while we can.\"\n\nWith 15 other export projects currently under review by the Energy Department, the United States could soon become the world's second-largest natural gas exporter, trailing only Russia, the largest seller due to its long-term contracts with energy buyers across Europe and beyond.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, demand for natural gas is expected to increase by 50 percent over the next 20 years, with most growth coming from emerging markets like India and China, which are heavily reliant on energy imports to support their economies.\n\nHowever, obstacles remain. Large American consumers of natural gas, such as the petrochemicals industry, are concerned that record-low domestic gas prices could rise if energy companies are allowed to export natural gas. Politicians also express concerns about the impact of exports on the country's energy security.\n\nRoger Ihne, a principal in the energy practice of the consultancy Deloitte in Houston, commented, \"People are struggling to decide what to do with this energy gift.\"\n\nThe glut places the United States at the center of the increasingly globalized natural gas market. Unlike the oil industry, which relies on a few global benchmark prices, the natural gas sector was a regional business until recently. Prices still vary wildly among continents, and most producers depend on vast pipeline networks to supply local customers like energy utilities and industrial companies.\n\nTechnology is changing how business is done, including how natural gas is extracted from the earth\u2014via a technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking\u2014and how the fuel is transported over long distances. By converting their product to liquefied natural gas (L.N.G.), natural gas suppliers can ship overseas in large tankers rather than relying on decades-old pipelines, which often run through politically unstable countries.\n\nWith the potential to ship anywhere in the world, energy companies are connecting regional natural gas markets to a greater extent than ever before. Analysts say producers can hunt for the highest price across different continents before deciding where to ship the gas.\n\nFor example, Qatar, the world's largest L.N.G. exporter, has shifted supplies from its European customers to new clients in Asia due to Europe's economic problems reducing demand there. In Asia, political decisions, such as Japan's move to close its remaining nuclear power plants after the disaster at the country's Fukushima reactor, have increased demand for L.N.G. imports. This year, Cheniere Energy, a Houston energy firm, signed a 20-year deal with the Korea Gas Corporation to ship natural gas to South Korea beginning in 2017. Cheniere, which plans to export from Louisiana, also has a long-term contract with GAIL India, the country's largest natural gas distributor.\n\nTeri Viswanath, a commodity strategist at the French bank BNP Paribas in New York, stated, \"Asian companies are out in front in signing natural gas contracts. For countries like China, the tremendous domestic demand ensures it will always be an importer.\"\n\nStronger ties within the natural gas industry are also bringing international energy companies to America. By acquiring stakes in American energy projects, analysts say, foreign firms are seeking access to the country's vast untapped resources.\n\nIn early October, Golden Pass Products, a venture whose majority owner is the state-owned Qatar Petroleum International, was granted a license to export liquefied natural gas from a proposed site in Texas. The British energy company BG Group, which owns shale gas deposits from Texas to New York, also plans to ship American natural gas from its operations in Louisiana.\n\nDespite the multibillion-dollar investments, changes are not expected to happen overnight. Building L.N.G. terminals, for example, can take years. And many utilities, particularly in Europe and Asia, are locked into contracts with existing natural gas producers that could limit the opportunities for new entrants like American companies.\n\nYet the expansion of the natural gas industry in the United States and elsewhere, including in East Africa and South America, is expected to transform the sector over the next 20 years.\n\nJoseph A. Stanislaw, a founder of the consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates, commented, \"We still have regional markets, but they are becoming more tied together with each successive year.\"",
    " Title: Decrease in National Security Advocacy Organizations Since 2008\n\nArticle:\n\nSince 2008, many advocacy organizations have shifted their focus from national security, leaving a political vacuum for members of Congress when considering military action, such as the potential strikes on Syria's regime over the alleged use of chemical weapons. The public's opposition to military action and the lack of infrastructure to change public opinion have created a daunting political reality for lawmakers.\n\nIn the past, during the height of the national debate over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there was a robust network of groups on both the left and right advocating on issues of war and peace. However, since President Barack Obama's election and the 2008 financial meltdown, many of the most assertive advocacy organizations have either withered away or shifted their focus to topics other than national security.\n\nThis atrophy is particularly noticeable on the right, where once-prominent groups set up to support interventionist politicians have all but disappeared. Freedom's Watch, a Republican group that spent tens of millions of dollars in the 2008 campaign marshaling support for the Iraq war, disbanded after Obama's election. The conservative veterans' advocacy organization Vets for Freedom has gone dormant, with the last video posted on its website being a 2010 clip from MSNBC's \"Hardball.\" Keep America Safe, a hawkish group founded in 2009 by Liz Cheney and others, closed up shop ahead of Cheney's decision to run for Senate in Wyoming.\n\nAri Fleischer, former Bush White House press secretary and one of the founders of Freedom's Watch, stated that there is no standing entity dedicated to supporting aggressive foreign and military policy. Fleischer, who supports military action in Syria, said, \"I don't know that there's ever been such a group, really, especially since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\" Freedom's Watch, he recalled, was intended to continue its work, but ultimately became an organization with a \"one-time mission\" focused on Iraq.\n\nPete Hegseth, the former head of Vets for Freedom, said the Syria issue doesn't lend itself to sharp partisan battle lines. He supports \"limited action that shows red lines matter\" in Syria but doesn't expect substantial pro-intervention advocacy from outside groups. Hegseth now helms the nonprofit group Concerned Veterans for America, which didn't advertise in the 2012 elections and has no plans at present to do so in 2014.\n\n\"Iraq was such a galvanizing issue for so many people,\" said Hegseth. \"I certainly wouldn't start a Syria intervention organization right now.\"\n\nThe anti-war side of the advocacy world has also slowed down. Some Democratic-leaning groups that ran TV ads defending opposition to the Iraq war have turned their attention more recently to domestic issues. The liberal Americans United for Change, which aired ads back in the 2008 cycle pressuring Republican lawmakers to break ranks on Iraq (and accusing then-Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman of wanting \"permanent war\" there), says Syria isn't on the top of its agenda. AUC president Brad Woodhouse said there are \"no current plans\" to dive into that debate.\n\n\"We're busy on Obamacare and gearing up for the budget fight,\" said Woodhouse, formerly a top strategist at Obama's Democratic National Committee.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Propose Firearm and Ammunition Taxes as Part of Broader Gun Control Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nLawmakers at both the state and federal levels are introducing new taxes on firearms and ammunition as part of a broader effort to regulate firearms in response to mass shootings such as the Newtown school shooting. The proposed taxes range from a 5 percent tax on firearms in New Jersey to a 50 percent tax on ammunition in Maryland.\n\nThe taxes, similar to so-called \"sin taxes\" on items like cigarettes, aim to deter buyers and generate revenue for favored programs such as mental health services, police training, and victims' treatment. However, firearms groups argue that a \"sin tax\" on firearms unfairly penalizes law-abiding gun owners.\n\nLawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, stated, \"If anything, gun owners ought to be getting a tax rebate for helping reduce crime.\" He added that the taxes are intended to \"frustrate and limit the exercise of the Second Amendment.\"\n\nWhile some revenue from these taxes and fees would go to victims' services, Keane argued that those paying the tax are not typically responsible for gun crime. \"We're obviously extremely opposed to trying to tax the lawful exercise of the Second Amendment rights by law-abiding Americans,\" he said.\n\nAt the federal level, Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) has proposed a bill that would impose a 10 percent tax on \"any concealable\" firearm, with the revenue used to fund a national gun buyback program. The bill is still in committee.\n\nIn California, state Rep. Roger Dickinson recently introduced a bill to impose a 5-cent tax on every bullet. Massachusetts state Rep. David Linsky is pushing a 25 percent sales tax on ammunition and firearms, while Maryland state Rep. Jon Cardin has introduced a bill imposing a 50 percent tax on ammunition and an annual $25 gun registration fee.\n\nAccording to the Las Vegas Review Journal, Assembly Majority Leader William Horne is pushing a draft bill that would include a $25 per gun sales tax, in addition to a 2-cent tax for every round of ammunition.\n\nThe tax proposals are part of a broader campaign by pro-gun control lawmakers to regulate firearms. While some states, such as Colorado, have moved forward with new gun regulations, the movement on Capitol Hill has been more restrained. President Obama, who has been quiet on the gun control issue since initiating gun legislation, is expected to discuss the topic during a speech to supporters and donors in Washington on Wednesday.",
    " Title: Trump Defends Soleimani Strike, Cites Iranian Influence in Iraq\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has defended the U.S. airstrike that killed Iran's top military commander, Qassem Soleimani, on Friday, stating that Soleimani \"should have been taken out many years ago\" and was \"directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets, Trump addressed the decision to launch air strikes that killed Iran's top military commander, marking his first public comments on authorizing the action.\n\n\"General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more... but got caught! He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself,\" Trump tweeted Friday morning.\n\nThe president also stated that Soleimani was \"both hated and feared within the country\" and that the people of Iraq \"don't want to be dominated & controlled by Iran.\" Trump added that the U.S. has paid Iraq billions of dollars over the years and that Iran has gained more and more control over Iraq, causing instability in the region.\n\nSoleimani is believed to be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. soldiers over the years, and the airstrike at Baghdad's airport received applause from Republicans. However, the strike has left much of the world on edge, and Iran has vowed revenge.\n\nThe State Department on Friday urged U.S. citizens to leave Iraq immediately and said that American citizens \"should not approach\" the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The Pentagon confirmed that the president had ordered a strike against Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' elite Quds Force.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that the move \"saved American lives.\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, called Soleimani's death \"bitter\" but vowed that life would be \"more bitter for the murderers and criminals.\" Foreign Minister Javad Zarif called the strike against Soleimani an \"act of international terrorism\" and a \"foolish escalation.\"\n\nThe move marked a significant escalation in Trump's widening confrontation with Iran and stoked fears about the potential for destabilizing consequences in the region. In a sign of the immediate ramifications, the U.S. Embassy in Iraq urged Americans to immediately leave the country.\n\nDemocrats have criticized Trump for not giving Congress proper notification of the strike and warned of the potential for significant and debilitating consequences. The White House and Trump, who is at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., had been relatively quiet about the decision until Friday. Late Thursday, shortly before the Pentagon statement was issued, the president tweeted an image of an American flag without any text. Earlier Friday, Trump also retweeted a number of accounts referencing the strike and wrote cryptically that Iran \"never won a war, but never lost a negotiation.\"",
    " Title: Katie Couric Accused of Deceptive Editing in Second Documentary\n\nArticle:\n\nKatie Couric, who recently admitted to deceptive editing in an interview with pro-gun activists, is facing new accusations of manipulating another film, \"Fed Up,\" to embarrass interviewees. According to the Washington Free Beacon, Couric, the producer of the film, allegedly edited the documentary to discredit individuals who were interviewed.\n\n\"Fed Up\" examines the issue of obesity and the food industry. The Free Beacon reported that the film includes two interviews with figures who hold viewpoints counter to the narrative of the film, and sources say both interviews include at least one misleading or deceptive edit intended to embarrass the interviewee.\n\nDr. David Allison, director of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center and an expert interviewed in \"Fed Up,\" told the paper that Couric's actions were \"antithetical to not only just human decency and civility but is antithetical to the spirit of science and democratic dialogue.\"\n\nAllison said he had a brief discussion with Couric about whether sugary drinks exacerbate America's obesity problem more than other foods. Couric reportedly questioned Allison about the science behind his claims, and he asked for a moment to \"get his thoughts together\" because she had specifically requested that all his answers be in layman terms. Allison said Couric told him before filming that he could take a moment to collect his thoughts at any point.\n\nIn a clip of the interview, Couric responds to Allison's on-camera request with, \"OK.\" However, the cameras continued rolling, and Allison can be seen sitting silently for nearly 10 seconds before the documentary cuts to the next interviewee. After those seven seconds passed, Allison says he answered Couric's question.\n\n\"I had what I thought was a very cogent answer,\" he said. \"Of course, I gave an answer. I gave an answer to every question she asked me in a 90-minute interview, and out of a 90-minute interview, she chose to show the approximately 10 seconds when I paused and said, 'Let me collect my thoughts.'\"\n\nIn another example, Stephanie Soechtig, director of \"Fed Up,\" is accused of deceptively editing an interview with Lisa Gable, a spokeswoman for the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation. Sources told the Free Beacon that Soechtig's voice was edited to embarrass Gable.\n\nSoechtig and Gable talked about whether stores would consider removing food products from shelves. At one point, Soechtig can be heard saying Gable is avoiding the question, and Gable is seen sitting silently for around three seconds.\n\n\"She is badgered about companies' willingness to reformulate their products, to which the producer answers, 'It feels like you're avoiding the question,'\" an industry source told the Free Beacon. \"That response from the producer didn't actually follow that particular exchange and was edited to make it look like that was how their conversation actually went.\"\n\nWatch the \"Fed Up\" clip of the interview with Lisa Gable.\n\nAnother source told the paper, \"It was apparent in the 'Fed Up' documentary that all interviewees were not treated equally.\"\n\nThe new accusations surface only one week after Couric accepted blame for deceptively editing the \"Under the Gun\" documentary. Couric wrote on the website of \"Under the Gun\" about the edit:\n\n\"I take responsibility for a decision that misrepresented an exchange I had with members of the Virginia Citizens Defense League (VCDL). My question to the VCDL regarding the ability of convicted felons and those on the terror watch list to legally obtain a gun, was followed by an extended pause, making the participants appear to be speechless. When I screened an early version of the film with the director, Stephanie Soechtig, I questioned her and the editor about the pause and was told that a 'beat' was added for, as she described it, 'dramatic effect,' to give the audience a moment to consider the question. When VCDL members recently pointed out that they had in fact immediately answered this question, I went back and reviewed it and agree that those eight seconds do not accurately represent their response.\"\n\nShe also expressed some remorse for the edit, saying, \"I regret that those eight seconds were misleading and that I did not raise my initial concerns more vigorously.\"\n\nUpon hearing news of the \"Under the Gun\" edit, radio host Rush Limbaugh came down harshly on Couric, whom he described as \"not a nice person.\"\n\n\"It was a totally fake and phony edit, and she's now taking responsibility for it because the pressure obviously got to be so intense,\" Limbaugh said.\n\n\"I bet you there will not be a single story on how many sponsors she's lost because of this. Not a single one. Nor will there be any stories on how many sponsors lost here and wanted to come back and we said 'no' to. There won't be any coverage like that at all, cause that's not the point of the coverage.\"\n\n\"So they're gonna try to cover it up for Katie and limit the damage to her as much possible. That's why she feels confident going out there and taking the hit cause she knows it's gonna all be over by the next day. And no harm, no foul, and she'll still be doing what she's doing the same way she's doing it. In other words, getting away with it \u2013 except when she's caught.\"\n\nSoechtig, the film's director, released a statement trying to explain why she inserted the long pause of nothingness: \"There are a wide range of views expressed in the film. My intention was to provide a pause for the viewer to have a moment to consider this important question before presenting the facts on Americans' opinions on background checks. I never intended to make anyone look bad and I apologize if anyone felt that way.\"\n\nAlthough the documentary cut out the responses, the film's website is now providing the transcript, showing the responses were immediate and substantive.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Exchange Tariff Threats, Escalating Trade Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States and China have exchanged tariff threats this week, with the potential for a full-blown trade war looming. On Wednesday, China released a list of $50 billion worth of U.S. products targeted with tariffs, in response to the Trump administration's threat to increase taxes on $1,300 billion of China's high-tech imports. This is not yet a declared trade war, but economists are describing it as a preliminary stage, with both sides testing each other's limits without engaging in full-blown action.\n\nChina's new tariffs list targets U.S. industries that are significant in China and areas that are politically influential for President Trump, such as agriculture and other industries that do substantial business in China. The list includes soybeans, pork, cranberries, whiskey, automobiles, airplanes, and plastic, among other products.\n\nPresident Trump has made good on a campaign promise to address China's trade abuses with these tariffs and other trade policies. The tariffs and other measures are aimed at China's intellectual property theft, a long-standing issue for U.S. companies.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted, \"We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We can not let this continue!\"\n\nThe risks of an escalating exchange of tariffs with America's largest trading partner are substantial, with potential higher prices for U.S. consumers and lost jobs in affected industries. However, Denise Bode, a tax and trade analyst at a Washington law firm, believes a full-blown trade war is possible but more likely that President Trump will make a deal.\n\nIn issuing its hit list, China blamed the U.S. for picking a fight. China's deputy commerce minister, Wang Shouwen, said, \"It must be said, we have been forced into taking this action.\" The value of the U.S. products on China's list is virtually identical to the $50 billion in Chinese high-tech products identified for tariffs on a list the Trump administration released late Tuesday.\n\nNeither list will go into immediate effect. The U.S. tariffs require a monthslong comment and review process, and China said it, too, is moving slowly. Larry Kudlow, director of the president's National Economic Council, tried to tamp down concerns about a trade war, saying a negotiated resolution is more likely.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) expressed concern about the impact on U.S. agriculture, stating, \"Farmers and ranchers shouldn't be expected to bear the brunt of retaliation for the entire country. It's not fair, and it doesn't make economic sense.\" Grassley vowed to push the issue in the Senate.\n\nThe 1,300 Chinese products on the U.S. tariff list include aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. China had previously threatened to retaliate when President Trump announced pending tariffs last month. China responded with a list of more than 120 U.S. items worth about $3 billion to hit with an import tax after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from all countries, though exemptions were later offered to Mexico, Canada, South Korea, and other major importers of those metals.",
    " Title: President Trump Calls for Potential Government Shutdown in September to Address Legislative Impasse\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called for a potential government shutdown in September, citing the need to address the current legislative impasse in Congress. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Trump expressed frustration with the filibuster rule in the Senate, which requires 60 votes for most legislation, and suggested that either more Republican senators need to be elected in 2018 or the rules need to be changed to a simple majority of 51 percent.\n\nTrump's comments appear to reflect his dissatisfaction with the spending deal Congress is poised to approve this week, which would fund the government through September and represents the first major bipartisan legislation of Trump's presidency. Democrats have argued that they won most of the battles surrounding the bill, and several media accounts have suggested that Trump and the White House were losers in the negotiations.\n\nThe measure will spare the president a damaging government shutdown, but it leaves out many of his biggest policy requests, such as funding for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and language stripping federal money from so-called sanctuary cities. The White House also backed off a threat to withhold ObamaCare subsidy payments to insurance companies.\n\nTrump did secure increased military spending in the 2017 budget deal, breaking with longstanding practice that a boost in Pentagon spending be accompanied by a dollar-for-dollar spike in domestic spending. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney defended the president's threat of a shutdown in the fall, stating, \"The president\u2019s tweet was that we might need a shutdown at some point to drive home that this place \u2014 that Washington needs to be fixed.\"\n\nMulvaney argued the current deal running through September was a White House victory because Democrats were determined to cause a shutdown that would hurt Trump. \"They wanted a shutdown. They wanted to try and make this president look like he could not govern,\" he said. \"And he beat them on that at the very, very highest level.\"\n\nTrump's comments are likely to irk top Republican lawmakers, who have been frustrated by Trump's repeated attempts to intervene in the legislative process. Senator John Cornyn did not mention the president or his tweets, but his remarks about the importance of avoiding a shutdown and the strength of the filibuster were notable coming shortly after Trump's tweets. \"We were elected to govern. Yes, governing is hard. It's hard by design,\" he said. \"But that's the way our founding fathers designed our constitutional system.\"\n\nIf GOP lawmakers are frustrated with Trump, however, the feeling may be mutual. The businessman-turned-president has vented frustration with the slow pace of work on Capitol Hill. \"I'm disappointed that it doesn't go quicker,\" Trump told Fox News last week when asked about the Republican effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare.",
    " Title: CIA Assessment Suggests Saudi Crown Prince Ordered Khashoggi Killing, Trump Maintains No Role for Now\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has intelligence that substantiates an assessment that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence. However, the official declined to characterize the confidence level of the CIA's assessment. A separate U.S. official told a news outlet on Friday that U.S. intelligence has \"high confidence\" in its assessment that bin Salman ordered the killing, an assessment based on an understanding of how Saudi Arabia operates.\n\nNeither official indicated that there is direct evidence linking bin Salman to the killing on the day of the incident. On Saturday, President Donald Trump called CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from Air Force One as he flew to California to view wildfire damage. President Trump has confidence in the CIA, according to press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, but she provided no additional details.\n\nBefore leaving the White House, President Trump stated that, regarding the crown prince, \"as of this moment we were told that he did not play a role.\" He added, \"We're going to have to find out what they have to say.\"\n\nIn his remarks, the president spoke of Saudi Arabia as \"a truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development.\" He also mentioned that he has to take a lot of things into consideration when deciding what measures to take against the kingdom.\n\nThe intelligence agencies' conclusion will bolster efforts in Congress to further punish the close U.S. ally for the killing. The Trump administration this past week penalized 17 Saudi officials for their alleged role in the killing, but American lawmakers have called on the administration to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia or take other harsher punitive measures.\n\nSaudi Arabia's top diplomat has said the crown prince had \"absolutely\" nothing to do with the killing. Vice President Mike Pence, when asked about the matter, declined to comment on \"classified information.\" He stated Saturday that the murder of Jamal Khashoggi was an atrocity and an affront to a free and independent press.\n\nJamal Khashoggi, a Saudi who lived in the United States, was a columnist for The Washington Post and often criticized the royal family. He was killed on October 2 at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul while seeking marriage documents. Turkish and Saudi authorities have said he was killed inside the consulate by a team from the kingdom.\n\nThis past week, U.S. intelligence officials briefed members of the Senate and House intelligence committees, and the Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials suspected of being responsible for or complicit in the killing. Also this past week, the top prosecutor in Saudi Arabia announced he will seek the death penalty against five men suspected in the killing.\n\nPresident Trump has called the killing a botched operation that was carried out very poorly and has said \"the cover-up was one of the worst cover-ups in the history of cover-ups.\" However, he has resisted calls to cut off arms sales to the kingdom and has been reluctant to antagonize the Saudi rulers. President Trump considers the Saudis vital allies in his Mideast agenda.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Rescinds DAPA Program, Leaves DACA Intact\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has rescinded a 2014 memo that allowed certain undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States, but has left intact the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, created in 2012. The DAPA program, which was never implemented due to court challenges, protected undocumented immigrants who have a child who is a U.S. citizen or lawful resident.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly announced the decision late Thursday, stating that there is \"no credible path forward\" to litigate the policy. The move fulfills part of President Trump's campaign promise to overturn two of former President Barack Obama's memos on illegal immigration.\n\nHowever, the terms of the DACA program, which grants reprieves from deportation to nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children, will not change. The rescinded program provided expanded work authorization for DACA recipients.\n\nAdvocates for undocumented immigrants have expressed concern that while the DACA program remains in place for now, it is vulnerable to future changes. Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for United We Dream, stated, \"The DACA program still stands, but it\u2019s vulnerable.\"\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) praised the decision to rescind the DAPA program, calling it \"a deeply irresponsible policy from the start.\" Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) criticized the move, noting that it came as Democrats and Republicans had put aside partisanship to gather for the Congressional Baseball Game following the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) during a practice session earlier in the week.",
    " Title: Romney Breaks with GOP on Minimum Wage, Expresses Support for Increase\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, expressed his support for an increase in the minimum wage during a Thursday morning interview on \"Morning Joe.\" Romney's stance on the issue contrasts with many Republicans who have historically opposed minimum wage hikes.\n\n\"I, for instance, as you know, part company with many of the conservatives in my party on the issue of the minimum wage,\" Romney said. \"I think we ought to raise it.\" He added, \"Our party is all about more jobs and better pay.\"\n\nRomney's comments come after Senate Republicans rejected a vote on a Senate bill that would have increased the minimum wage to $10.10. In recent times, former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, both of whom also ran for the Republican nomination in 2012, have also expressed support for some increase in the minimum wage.\n\nDuring the wide-ranging interview, Romney reiterated that he is not running for president in 2016. He mentioned several potential Republican presidential candidates, including his 2012 running mate, Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, among others.\n\nRomney also criticized Hillary Clinton, who is expected to be the presumptive front-runner for the Democrats if she chooses to run in 2016. When asked about her time as Secretary of State, Romney said, \"That's going to be an enormous liability for her... If you look around the world... this was not a good time for America.\" He added that Clinton's record as Secretary of State is \"going to raise a lot of questions about her capacity to actually accomplish things of significance, particularly on foreign soil.\"\n\nRomney also appeared to condone fundraising efforts by the National Republican Congressional Committee and National Republican Senatorial Committee that invoked the September 2012 attacks in Benghazi. When asked about fundraising off the issue, Romney responded by saying, \"Without a GOP majority in the House, there would have been no investigations into Benghazi or the IRS.\" The specifics of these fundraising efforts and Romney's exact stance on them were not detailed in the provided text.",
    " Title: Tribute in Light, Moments of Silence, and Commemoration Mark 18th Anniversary of 9/11 Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo parallel beams of light illuminated the New York City sky on Wednesday, marking the annual Tribute in Light public art installation, commemorating the 18th anniversary of the September 11th terror attacks. Simultaneously, bells tolled across New York City, President Donald Trump spoke at the Pentagon, and moments of silence were observed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and across the nation.\n\nIn New York, the names of the nearly 3,000 people who lost their lives were solemnly read at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. Intermittent moments of silence marked the impact times of the Ground Zero planes, the time when each tower collapsed, and the moment when planes struck the Pentagon and a field in Shanksville.\n\nMary Ann Marino, who read some of the names, including that of her son, firefighter Kenneth Marino, stated, \"Eighteen years have not lessened our loss.\"\n\nThe first moment of silence was observed at 8:46 a.m. EDT to mark the time when American Airlines Flight 11, en route to Los Angeles from Boston when it was hijacked, slammed into the north face of the World Trade Center's North Tower. At 9:03 a.m., United Airlines Flight 175, also bound for Los Angeles from Boston, when it crashed into the south face of the World Trade Center's South Tower. At 9:37 a.m., American Airlines Flight 77, scheduled to fly from Washington to Los Angeles when it hit the Pentagon. At 10:03 a.m., Flight 93, flying from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco when it slammed into a western Pennsylvania field.\n\nThe World Trade Center's South Tower collapsed at 9:59 a.m.; the North Tower fell 29 minutes later. The New York ceremony was open only to family members, but the event was streamed live. The memorial will open to the public later in the day.\n\nNicholas Haros Jr., whose mother, Frances, died in the World Trade Center, challenged a statement this summer from Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., that \"some people did something\" and that \"all of us were starting to lose access\" to civil liberties. Haros wore a black T-shirt with the words \"Some people did something\" as he read the names of the dead.\n\nIn Shanksville, Vice President Mike Pence lauded the heroes from United Airlines Flight 93. The Memorial Plaza is near the site where Flight 93 crashed into a field after passengers fought with hijackers intent on crashing into the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe memory of those who died is \"carved into the hearts and memories of the American people,\" Pence said. The names of the 40 passengers and crew were read, and the Bells of Remembrance were rung. A wreath was placed at the Wall of Names at the site.\n\nTrump led a brief remembrance on the South Lawn of the White House, joined by hundreds of guests, including 9/11 survivors and family members and current and former law enforcement personnel. He then spoke at a ceremony at the Pentagon, where 184 people were killed 18 years ago.\n\n\"Today the nation honors and mourns nearly 3,000 lives that were stolen from us,\" Trump said. He recounted going to Ground Zero after the planes hit.\n\n\"We are united with you in grief,\" he said. \"We offer you all that we have: our unwavering loyalty, our undying devotion, our eternal pledge that your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten.\"\n\nTrump blamed the Taliban for the cancellation of peace talks to try to end the war that started in Afghanistan shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks. He said U.S. forces have \"hit them\" harder than ever.\n\n\"And if for any reason they ever come back to our country, we will go wherever they are and use power the likes of which the U.S. has never used before,\" Trump said.\n\nCities and towns across the nation marked the anniversary. In Michigan, an anti-Muslim event was canceled amid condemnation from politicians and organizations. Bloomfield Hills Baptist Church announced in a one-sentence email Monday evening that it canceled a two-day event called \"9/11 forgotten? Is Michigan surrendering to Islam?\" that had been scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. The event was set to host two speakers addressing topics such as \"How the interfaith movement is sabotaging America and the church\" and \"How Islam is destroying America from within.\"",
    " Title: Indiana Governor Mike Pence Defends \"Religious Freedom\" Law, Faces Intense Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nIndiana Governor Mike Pence has defended his state's new \"Religious Freedom Restoration Act\" (RFRA), stating that the controversy surrounding the law is due to \"a tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding.\" However, Pence declined to answer several questions about whether the measure could be used to discriminate against LGBT individuals.\n\nDuring an appearance on ABC's \"This Week,\" Pence refused to confirm or deny that the RFRA legalizes discrimination against gays and lesbians. He also stated that he would not support legislation adding protections based on sexual orientation to Indiana's anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe RFRA, signed into law last week, allows Indiana businesses to cite their religious beliefs as a legal defense. The law has sparked intense backlash, with tech companies, mayors, sports organizations, and celebrities criticizing the measure.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest called Pence \"in damage control mode\" during the same segment on ABC's \"This Week.\" Apple CEO Tim Cook and Salesforce.com head Marc Benioff have both expressed their disapproval of the law, with Apple threatening to halt its expansion in Indiana and Salesforce.com encouraging employees to leave the state.\n\nMayors of San Francisco and Seattle have announced bans on public funds being spent on employee travel to Indiana, with San Francisco making exceptions for travel \"essential to the public health and safety.\" Seattle will inspect city contracts to see if any are with businesses located in Indiana.\n\nIndianapolis' mayor, Greg Ballard, condemned the new law, stating, \"We are a diverse city, and I want everyone who visits and lives in Indy to feel comfortable here. RFRA sends the wrong signal.\" The NCAA, which is headquartered in Indianapolis and is set to host its men's basketball Final Four in the city this week, has expressed concerns that the law could lead it to move events elsewhere in future years.\n\nPopular culture figures, such as Miley Cyrus and M.C. Hammer, have also weighed in, with Cyrus calling Pence an \"a--hole\" on Instagram and Hammer describing the law as \"barbaric and inhumane.\"\n\nPence maintained that the law is about protecting religious liberty and not about discriminating against LGBT individuals. He noted that President Bill Clinton signed a similar law nationally, and then-state Sen. Barack Obama supported one in Illinois.\n\nHowever, when asked about comments made by Eric Miller, the head of Advance America and a powerful lobbyist on socially conservative causes in Indiana, Pence refused to answer several times whether Miller's claims, such as refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage or allowing a man to use the women's restroom, were accurate.\n\nLocal businesses have also expressed concerns, with the chief executive of Angie's List, who was also the campaign manager for Pence's Republican predecessor, former Gov. Mitch Daniels, stating that his company is halting its plans for a major expansion in Indianapolis.\n\nPence is open to legislative efforts to clarify the \"religious freedom\" law, though the state's Republican-dominated legislature has already rejected Democrats' push to amend it to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination. Pence stated, \"This is not about disputes between individuals, it's about government overreach, and I'm proud that Indiana stepped forward.\"",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Court African American Voters Amidst Ongoing Structural Inequalities\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Democratic presidential primaries progress, candidates are focusing on courting African American voters in states such as Nevada, South Carolina, and those participating in Super Tuesday. However, many candidates' rhetoric contrasts with their records, as their promises often conflict with their past performances.\n\nDonald Trump, in an attempt to appeal to black voters, has highlighted the economy, the initial steps towards reducing mass incarceration, and the so-called \"opportunity zones.\" Despite this, his history, which includes the racially charged \"birther\" movement, embracing white supremacists at Charlottesville, a focus on erasing Obama's legacy, and a political strategy that relies on race-baiting politics, contradicts his current efforts.\n\nPete Buttigieg, who is often praised for his oratory skills, faces criticism from African American leaders in his hometown regarding his record on race and policing as mayor. Amy Klobuchar, who positions herself as a moderate, has a controversial record as a prosecutor that limits her appeal. Mike Bloomberg, who has the financial resources to dominate the campaign trail, struggles to explain his harsh and racially biased stop-and-frisk policies as mayor of New York and his embrace of right-wing conspiracy theories.\n\nJoe Biden is also on an apparent apology tour, joining Bloomberg. African American voters are not easily swayed, as they are acutely aware of the structural inequalities they face, including higher unemployment rates, lower wages, inadequate healthcare, and a biased criminal justice system.\n\nNotably absent from the debate is a leader who is prepared to address the challenges facing African Americans with the same boldness and seriousness as the Kerner Commission, established in the aftermath of the urban riots of the late 1960s. The commission, chaired by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner, issued a stark warning: \"Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white\u2014separate and unequal.\"\n\nThe Kerner Report, as it became known, offered a comprehensive agenda to address the structural inequalities, including new jobs, integrated schools, daycare for children, higher wages, greater services, and more diverse and sensitive police forces. The report did not shy away from the significant costs associated with implementing these recommendations, suggesting that the cost of inaction would be far greater.\n\nUnfortunately, the costs of the Vietnam War, both in terms of money, lives, and political upheaval, overshadowed any serious effort to address domestic issues during that time. The Kerner Report, along with Johnson's War on Poverty, was lost in the jungles of Vietnam.\n\nFifty-two years later, much has changed, yet many issues remain unresolved. Affirmative action has provided opportunities for some people of color, but structural racism still permeates our society, particularly in the criminal justice system. As the politicians campaign for African American votes, they will receive a hearing. We appreciate the attention and gestures, but the Kerner Report set the standard for what a serious leader would champion. We'll see who comes close\u2014if anyone does\u2014to accepting that challenge.",
    " Title: Unresolved Budget Impasse Could Lead to Slower Job Growth in 2013, Economists Warn\n\nArticle:\n\nEconomists are expressing concern that job creation could slow significantly if President Obama and Congressional Republicans fail to reach an agreement on deficit reduction by the end of the year, leading to more than $600 billion in government spending cuts and automatic tax increases in 2013. The Congressional Budget Office, along with many private economists, warn that this path could lead to a recession in the first half of 2013 and push unemployment rates higher.\n\nEthan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, stated that while businesses seem to be hiring despite the uncertainty in Washington, this could change quickly. \"If the budget impasse can't be resolved this month, it's likely that jobs growth will weaken early next year,\" he said.\n\nEven if both sides in Washington come up with a short-term solution on the budget, the pace of job growth remains well below what is needed to push wages substantially higher or to significantly reduce the broadest measure of unemployment anytime soon. In November, the broad unemployment gauge dipped to 14.4 percent from 14.6 percent in October.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in November, and are up about 1.7 percent from a year earlier\u2014about half the annual rate of growth seen in 2007 before the recession hit, when unemployment was below 5 percent. The size of the labor force, according to a household survey separate from the one showing how many jobs were added by businesses and government, shrank by 350,000 in November.\n\nThe labor participation rate, which represents the portion of the adult population that is either employed or actively looking for work, remains low by historical standards. At 63.6 percent in November, it is near the low point in this economic cycle, said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight.\n\n\"We're not at the point in which the jobs market is strong enough to pull discouraged workers back into the labor market,\" he said. Although job growth in November exceeded expectations, the Labor Department revised downward its figures for the preceding months. For September, the Labor Department said the economy created 132,000 jobs, down from an earlier estimate of 148,000, and the figure for October was lowered to 138,000 from 171,000.\n\nHighlighting just how vulnerable the economy remains, a widely followed measure of how likely consumers were to make purchases showed a marked drop. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer confidence for early December, released on Friday, fell to 74.5, down from 82.7 in November.\n\nOne notable point of weakness in the latest jobs report was the manufacturing sector, which lost 7,000 jobs in November. Demand for goods from Europe and other overseas markets has softened recently, and some manufacturing companies have held up spending amid the standoff in Washington.\n\nEmployment in the construction sector fell by 20,000 last month\u2014one hint of Hurricane Sandy's impact, economists said. However, construction employment could pick up in December as homeowners rebuild in the Northeast and as the housing sector continues to regain ground nationwide.\n\nRetailers added 53,000 jobs last month, more than triple the typical monthly rate in the last year. Much of that increase was to accommodate holiday shoppers, and Julia Coronado, chief North American economist at BNP Paribas, suggested the early start of sales promotions and an early Thanksgiving may have encouraged stores to hire workers more quickly than usual in November.\n\n\"We may see less of a gain in retail in December,\" she said. \"This was a very, very strong number that probably won't persist.\"\n\nAmong the unemployed, the percentage of people who have been out of a job for more than 27 weeks remains high but came down slightly in November, falling to 40.1 percent from 40.6 percent a month before.\n\nYounger workers, who have had significantly higher rates of unemployment than older workers since the recession, also seem to have done a bit better in November. According to seasonally adjusted figures in the household survey, unemployment among workers aged 20 to 24 fell to 12.7 percent in November from 13.2 percent in October, and among 25- to 34-year-olds it fell to 7.9 percent from 8.3 percent.\n\nWhile substantially lower, the unemployment rate among workers 55 and older held steady at 5.8 percent.",
    " Title: Trump Confirms Obama's U.S. Birth, Denies Role in Birther Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a campaign event at the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. on Friday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump confirmed that President Barack Obama was born in the United States. However, Trump's statement contradicts the claim that his campaign had previously made about his role in the so-called \"birther movement.\"\n\nTrump's statement came after five years of questioning Obama's citizenship on various media platforms. Despite his campaign manager and spokesperson stating that Trump believes Obama was born in the United States, Trump had not explicitly acknowledged this fact until Friday.\n\nDuring the event, Trump stated, \"Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy,\" which is a claim that has been widely discredited. Trump added, \"I finished it. I finished it, you know what I mean.\"\n\nThe event, billed as a campaign event, was held in the gilded ballroom of the $212 million hotel at 1100 Pennsylvania Ave., which remains federal property. The hotel, which is still under construction, is partially open for business, with rooms available for $895 a night.\n\nTrump's opening remarks were an advertisement for the hotel, and he claimed the hotel was finished under budget and ahead of schedule, a claim that is not true. He then turned his attention to the people onstage, praising the generals and Medal of Honor winners present.\n\nWhen he returned to the lectern, the crowd erupted in chants of \"USA!\" Trump talked in a sleepy tone, delivering platitudes about improving the country and mistruths about the state of the country. He then made the statement, \"Now, I just want to tell you all, President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.\"\n\nTrump took no questions and offered no explanation for why he had changed his stance after Obama released his long-form birth certificate in 2011. For years, Trump had questioned Obama's citizenship, fueling the birther movement, but on Friday, he stated, \"I finished it.\"\n\nThe birther movement, which questioned Obama's citizenship and eligibility to be president, gained traction in 2008, with claims that Obama's mother was unable to fly in the late months of her pregnancy, and so he was born in Kenya. These claims were largely discredited, and Hillary Clinton, during her 2008 campaign, did not push the rumors.\n\nTrump's announcement comes as the polls are narrowing, and his campaign strategists' advice to act more diplomatically has proven effective. However, a few words on the subject cannot erase years of questioning Obama's citizenship, which has been widely criticized as racist. After Trump exited the ballroom, the blue curtain collapsed onto the stage, taking down the American flags with it.",
    " Title: House Armed Services Committee Releases Report on Benghazi Attack, Finds White House Failed to Comprehend Security Situation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House Armed Services Committee, led by Republicans, has released a report today, concluding that the White House failed to comprehend or ignored the deteriorating security situation in Libya prior to the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. The report also states that U.S. personnel in Benghazi were \"woefully vulnerable\" and that the Defense Department believed the violence was a terrorist attack \"nearly from the outset.\"\n\nThe 31-page report, authored by Chairman Buck McKeon (R-Calif.), Vice Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), and Rep. Martha Roby (R-Ala.), found that the administration did not direct a change in military force posture, there was no intelligence of a specific \"imminent\" threat in Libya, and the Department of State, which has primary responsibility for diplomatic security, \"favored a reduction\" of Department of Defense security personnel in Libya before the attack.\n\nThe report also agrees with the administration that during the attack, military assets were not positioned to make a difference in the response, and there was no stand-down order issued by the administration to forces in Tripoli preparing to respond. However, it states that \"there was no'stand down' order issued to U.S. military personnel in Tripoli who sought to join the fight in Benghazi.\"\n\nDemocrats on the committee, including ranking Democrat Adam Smith (D-Wash.) and Rep. Niki Tsongas, the top Democrat on the committee's investigative subcommittee, believe the Republican report ends the controversy that there was any corruption in the aftermath of the attack. They wrote in a statement, \"It is time to move forward, take the real conclusions we have arrived at and establish how to best protect our citizens around the globe.\"\n\nThe report comes after Republicans on the committee had previously accused the Obama administration of preventing a rescue attempt by the U.S. military. The attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. It triggered a firestorm of criticism accusing the Obama administration of covering up its response to the attack.",
    " Title: House Republicans, President Obama Still Far Apart on Budget Priorities After Meeting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to bridge the partisan divide between the White House and House Republicans, President Barack Obama met with GOP leaders on Wednesday, but the meeting yielded little progress on budget priorities. The meeting, part of the White House's \"charm offensive\" on Capitol Hill, was followed by a news conference where House Speaker John Boehner thanked the president for coming but noted the challenges remaining on a host of issues, particularly those related to reducing the deficit.\n\nRepublicans' top priority, tackling federal spending and reining in record deficits, came up early in the Republican conference meeting. Oklahoma Rep. Jim Lankford asked the first question, pressing the president to explain why he would not join House Republicans in their effort to balance the budget in a decade. According to several Republicans, Obama explained that he did not share that priority, an answer that many emphasized as they left the meeting.\n\nGeorgia Rep. Paul Broun, a conservative who is running for the Senate, mentioned that exchange as he left, telling reporters, \"basically his whole talk was just a bunch of platitudes and no substance to it.\"\n\nRep. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, said afterward, \"He thought what was more important was that deficits fall below growth as a percentage of GDP -- certainly a laudable goal, but I think the federal government, like any business or any family, needs to work towards a balanced budget.\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor gave a blunt assessment about the divide on fiscal issues, suggesting it could carry over to other issues. \"If the president wants to let our unwillingness to raise taxes get in the way, then we're not going to be able to set differences aside and focus on what we agree on,\" Cantor told reporters at the GOP leaders' news conference.\n\nWhen Lankford raised fiscal issues during the meeting, he also pointed out that the president's other meeting on Wednesday was with his political arm, Organizing for Action. This rankled many GOP members who suggested Obama was more concerned with political goals than working across the aisle.\n\n\"We know the president is going to speak before Organizing for Action tonight,\" Rep. Greg Walden, R-Oregon, who leads the House Republicans' campaign arm, told reporters as he left the meeting. \"We know he's made it clear that taking out the House is his big priority, and we know he's been on the never-ending campaign tour up to this point, so there's a trust factor.\"\n\nMindful of the House GOP undercurrent that Obama is chiefly focused on scoring political points, one source inside the meeting said the president addressed those concerns directly at the end of the meeting. This source told CNN that the president told GOP members that if he were only focused on the midterms, he would not be pushing immigration reform because that's not necessarily helpful for some members of his party. He said he would not push for entitlement reform because a lot of Democrats do not agree and are nervous about tackling such a politically explosive issue.\n\nHe told them that he runs the country, that he wants it to succeed, and that he looks around the room and sees other people who love their country. Obama said they have a moment and should seize it, according to this source.\n\nWalden did say the session helped build some trust, and it was a good opportunity to raise a wide spectrum of issues. He mentioned Israel as one area where both parties found some common ground.\n\nExiting the conference, House Budget Committee Chairman and former Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) said of the president, \"He did himself some good.\"\n\nSeveral members in the meeting said it helped open a dialogue but lamented that the session was only the second time the president had traveled up Pennsylvania Avenue to talk to House Republicans since he was elected.\n\n\"The president does not spend a lot of time working with members of Congress. He does not have to -- he's president of the United States -- but I think it's made his job a lot more difficult, and it's made our task a lot more difficult because there's very little communication,\" Florida Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart said after the meeting.\n\nCotton described the president's demeanor in the meeting as \"affable\" and said the various members who asked questions were \"very cordial and respectful.\"\n\nAccording to multiple GOP sources, conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington screened questions in advance and called on members after the president made opening remarks.\n\nRep. Michael Grimm of New York said the event had been peppered with occasional lighter moments such as speculation after word got around the room that the new pope was about to be announced.\n\n\"Anyone who thinks this president is anything but affable and pleasant when he's speaking with a group is just simply wrong. They haven't met him,\" said Grimm. But he added he was waiting to see if the president would follow up his outreach with some bipartisan action.\n\nObama fielded some tense questions during the meeting. Michigan Rep. Candice Miller told reporters she was not satisfied with the president's response to her complaint that the White House had suspended public tours after forced spending cuts went into effect. Republicans have charged that the closures were politically motivated, but Obama said Wednesday the decision had been made by the Secret Service.",
    " Title: \"Congress Introduces Over 90 'Jobs' Bills in Response to Unemployment Concerns\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past 18 months, the United States Congress has introduced approximately 90 bills, collectively labeled as \"jobs\" bills, with the aim of creating or preserving jobs. This is a significant increase compared to the previous two-year congressional cycle and the Congress before that. The Labor Department reported on Friday that employers nationwide added only 80,000 jobs in June, maintaining an unemployment rate of 8.2 percent.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, stated on Friday that the Senate will move toward votes on a series of \"common-sense jobs bills.\" These bills include a small-business tax cut designed to incentivize hiring and promote payroll growth.\n\nHowever, job-creation policies, like many issues on Capitol Hill, are often subject to partisan and political spin. The definition of a \"jobs bill\" can vary, with Republicans characterizing the employment report as evidence that the jobs agenda of the Obama administration and the Democrat-controlled Congress has been ineffective.\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, stated that the jobs agenda of the Obama administration and the Democrat-controlled Congress has failed, citing the June employment report. He called on the president to work with Republicans to remove government obstacles to job creation.\n\nThe House GOP leaders plan to introduce legislation this summer to \"rein in job-crushing red tape,\" including a measure to continue tax cuts instituted during the administration of President George W. Bush that are set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nSome of the so-called \"jobs\" bills seem to stretch the definition of job creation. For example, the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act, which does not specifically mention jobs, aims to more efficiently develop domestic sources of strategically important minerals. House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, a Washington Republican, claims the measure will streamline government red tape in mining and related industries, fostering job growth.\n\nThe Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act, which the House passed but is indefinitely stalled in the Senate, is also labeled as a jobs bill by House GOP leadership. The bill aims to exempt \"farm dust\" from falling under Clean Air Act regulations, a move that the bill's backers claim will protect American farm jobs.\n\nA massive bill that cleared Congress last month to fund federal transportation projects was a rare example of legislation claimed by both parties to boost job growth. The bill promises to save or create almost 3 million jobs. However, the \"highway bill\" almost stalled due to a dispute over a proposed Keystone XL pipeline provision.\n\nThe debate over job-creation bills often revolves around the number of jobs that would be preserved or created. GOP backers often put the number in the tens of thousands, a figure dismissed by opponents as excessively optimistic.\n\nLawmakers also label measures they dislike as job killers. The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is a frequent target. Republicans argue that the law will force employers to lay off workers or close up shop altogether. Representative Michele Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican and former presidential candidate, stated in late June that the \"No. 1 reason [small businesses] aren't hiring is because of Obamacare.\"\n\nPresident Obama has stated that the health care law, most of which was upheld by the Supreme Court last month, will lay a foundation for a stronger economy that will create jobs.",
    " Title: Trump Signals Desire for Eased Coronavirus Restrictions by Easter, Contradicting Public Health Experts\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed a desire to ease up on coronavirus-related restrictions in the United States within the next three weeks, a timeline that contradicts the advice of top public health experts. During a Fox News town-hall event at the White House on Tuesday, Trump stated, \"I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,\" referring to April 12.\n\nThe Fox News host Bill Hemmer responded, \"That would be a great American resurrection.\" Easter is a significant religious holiday for many Americans, and Trump added, \"Wouldn't it be great to have all the churches full?\"\n\nThis call to reopen the US economy goes against the advice of his own experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US's top expert on infectious diseases. On Friday, Fauci stated, \"I can't see that all of a sudden, next week or two weeks from now, it's going to be over. I don't think there's a chance of that.\"\n\nFauci added, \"I think we should do everything we possibly can do. I mean, in all sectors, because obviously, as I've said so many times, when you think you're maybe overreacting, you probably are not acting as forcefully as you should. So as we've always said, we've got to try very much to stay ahead of the curve.\"\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo of New York, who is on the front lines of the pandemic, also implored Trump not to risk endangering lives by rushing to reopen the economy. The World Health Organization has warned that the US could become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, citing a \"very large acceleration\" in infections.\n\nThe US had fewer than 100 confirmed coronavirus cases on March 1, but by Tuesday afternoon, it had nearly 50,000. The White House announced new guidelines on March 16 aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, including avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people, canceling nonessential travel, and not going out to bars and restaurants. These guidelines were intended to be in place for 15 days and then reassessed.\n\nPresident Trump has since signaled growing impatience with the stringent measures to fight the pandemic that have essentially shut down major US cities and dealt a huge blow to the economy. On Tuesday, Trump suggested that more people could die by suicide because of stress and anxiety about the economy than would die from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.\n\nHowever, Trump's power to reopen the economy is limited due to the 10th amendment, meaning these decisions will largely occur at the state level and be made by governors, not the president.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 280,000 Jobs in May, Unemployment Rate Increases Slightly\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy added 280,000 new jobs in May, surpassing economists' expectations of 226,000, according to the latest report from the U.S. Department of Labor. The unemployment rate, however, ticked up to 5.5 percent, despite economists' predictions that it would remain steady at 5.4 percent.\n\nThe leisure and hospitality sector experienced a significant growth with 57,000 new jobs, while the arts, entertainment, and recreation sector saw an increase of 29,000 jobs. Retail added 31,000 jobs, and the construction sector saw 17,000 new positions.\n\nThe civilian labor force saw an increase of 397,000 people, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but the labor participation rate remained virtually unchanged at 62.9 percent.\n\nThe latest figures follow a report on Thursday that unemployment claims had dropped, indicating that employers were confident in retaining workers. The Labor Department reported that claims had decreased by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 276,000.\n\nThe manufacturing workweek remained unchanged at 40.7 hours, and wages for private, nonfarm payrolls rose by 8 cents to $24.96.\n\nThe Associated Press notes that May's strong job growth \"suggests that employers remained confident enough to keep hiring even after the economy shrank during the first three months of the year.\" The government also revised up its estimate of job growth in March and April by a combined net 32,000.\n\nValuewalk.com points out that some investors have been watching the three-month average of 191,000 on the low end, and note that any print under this level would be a negative sign for the U.S. economy. To reassure economic observers, yield curve traders suggest that the upside job gains would need to move well past the 255,000 six-month moving average for nonfarm payrolls and show a print above 300,000.",
    " Title: Carolina Panthers Quarterback Cam Newton Stresses Accountability and Justice in Response to Charlotte Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nCarolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton emphasized the importance of accountability during a press conference on Wednesday, addressing the recent police shooting of an armed black man in Charlotte, North Carolina, which led to violent protests in the city this week.\n\n\"My big thing is always holding people accountable, no matter what the race is, no matter what the gender is, no matter what the age is. We all have to hold each other accountable,\" Mr. Newton stated, according to a local NBC News affiliate.\n\nHe further expressed, \"I'm a firm believer of justice. I'm a firm believer of doing the right thing.\"\n\nMr. Newton acknowledged his understanding of the frustrations in the black community due to what he referred to as \"this state of oppression.\" However, he added, \"We also, as black people, have to do right by ourselves. We can't be hypocrites.\"\n\nRegarding the death of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott, who was fatally shot by police on Tuesday at an apartment complex in Charlotte, and the subsequent rioting, Mr. Newton stated, \"My heart mourns for the family, but I just don't know enough info now.\"\n\nPolice reported that Mr. Scott had a gun in his possession at the time of his death, contradicting claims by his family that he was holding a book.\n\nMr. Newton remained mostly neutral during his comments, expressing concern over the number of police shootings in the U.S., which he described as \"embarrassing.\" He also lamented the potential consequences of speaking out on race relations, stating that he could be critiqued for doing so or accused of being insincere if he remained silent.\n\nCoach Ron Rivera supported Mr. Newton's comments, stating, \"I think he's very thoughtful when he talks about this city and his feelings. He thinks before he speaks.\" Rivera added, \"The best way to change things is to vote,'maybe instead of tearing up our city.'\"\n\nThe article does not provide further details about the specific circumstances surrounding the police shooting or the protests that followed.",
    " Title: Trump Accuses Clinton of Causing \"Tremendous Death\" in Middle East\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has introduced a new attack line against Hillary Clinton, stating that her decisions as Secretary of State during President Obama's first term led to unnecessary deaths in the Middle East. In an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, Trump argued that Clinton's policies were responsible for the rise of the Islamic State and the subsequent \"tremendous death and destruction\" in the region.\n\nTrump claimed that the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, a policy initiated by President George W. Bush, has led to the rise of the Islamic State. He asserted that Clinton, as a key figure during Obama's term, shares responsibility for the current state of the Middle East.\n\nIn addition, Trump has been criticized for his call for a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States, with the terrorist group al-Shabaab using a clip of Trump in their call for Muslims to join jihad or leave the U.S. Trump defended his statements, stating, \"What I have to say? There's a problem. We have to find out what is the problem. And we have to solve that problem.\"\n\nIn the interview, Trump also disagreed with President Obama on the need for more gun control, particularly if Obama were to move the issue by executive action rather than working with a recalcitrant Congress. Trump argued that mental health, not guns, is the root of the problem and suggested building institutions for the mentally ill.\n\nDespite leading in national polls, Trump plans to spend approximately $2 million per week on advertising in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. He commented, \"I think I'm probably wasting the money, but I'm $35 million under budget... I almost feel guilty.\"",
    " Title: House Approves Senate Compromise Bill to Avert Fiscal Cliff\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States House of Representatives voted Tuesday night to approve a Senate bill aimed at averting a feared fiscal cliff. The measure, which maintains tax cuts for most Americans while increasing rates on the wealthy, passed the Democratic-led Senate overwhelmingly earlier in the day.\n\nThe legislation, which would raise approximately $600 billion in new revenues over a decade, according to various estimates, was subject to an up-or-down vote in the House, with no amendments added.\n\nRepresentative Tom Cole (R-Oklahoma) told CNN before the House vote, \"I'd say let's take the Senate deal, fight another day.\" He predicted the House would pass the bill with a \"pretty strong bipartisan majority.\"\n\nRepresentative Nan Hayworth, an outgoing Republican representative from New York, said, \"This is the best we can do given the Senate and the White House sentiment at this point in time, and it is at least a partial victory for the American people.\" She added, \"I'll take that at this point.\"\n\nThe timing of the vote was crucial, as a new Congress is set to be sworn in on Thursday. The legislation averted much of the fiscal cliff's negative near-term economic impact by extending the Bush-era tax cuts for the majority of Americans. It also extends long-term unemployment benefits that were set to expire.\n\nHad the House not acted, and the tax cuts enacted last decade expired fully, broad tax increases would have kicked in, as would $110 billion in automatic cuts to domestic and military spending.",

The piece also criticizes the Democratic Party for prioritizing uncontrolled immigration over the safety of American citizens.\n\nThe article concludes by urging readers to demand a change in the midterm elections, stating that a Democratic majority would continue the \"bloodbath\" of American lives lost to illegal immigration.

    " Title: Journalistic Integrity Under Scrutiny: Fact-Checking and the Consequences of Inaccurate Reporting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of modern journalism, the credibility of news stories is under scrutiny as several high-profile incidents of inaccurate reporting have come to light. One such instance is the Rolling Stone's story about an alleged rape at the University of Virginia, which has since been debunked due to a lack of evidence to substantiate the claim. The university has since imposed sanctions on the entire Greek system, including sororities, despite the absence of concrete evidence.\n\nAnother example of questionable reporting can be found in New York magazine, where a high school student from Queens claimed to have made $72 million trading stocks during his lunch breaks. The student, Mohammad Islam, admitted to fabricating the story, and the magazine is currently investigating the matter further.\n\nA third instance of inaccurate reporting involves a story published in The New York Times, which claimed Pope Francis had stated that heaven is open to pets. The story was based on a misinterpretation of the pope's general audience at the Vatican and was later debunked as false.\n\nR. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., founder and editor-in-chief of The American Spectator, has highlighted these incidents as examples of the importance of fact-checking in journalism. He emphasizes that double-checking is a fundamental rule in journalism, and its absence can lead to the publication of inaccurate and misleading stories.\n\nThese incidents serve as a reminder of the importance of fact-checking and the potential consequences of inaccurate reporting.

    " Title: Obama Launches Gun Control Tour as Bloomberg Spends Millions on Ad Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is investing millions of dollars in a nationwide advertising campaign, while President Barack Obama is preparing for a tour focused on gun control, despite the failure of Senator Dianne Feinstein's latest gun control legislation last week. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has offered to present Feinstein's legislation as an amendment, but has no plans to bring the legislation as part of a larger gun control package to the Senate floor for a vote.\n\nBloomberg's pro-gun control group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, is launching the campaign in states where senators may be undecided about a package of firearms proposals being considered by the Senate. As the push for that legislation seems to falter, President Obama plans to soon tour the country to discuss the need to reduce gun violence, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News. Bloomberg also confirmed on Sunday that he plans to spend $12 million on ads in at least 10 states, suggesting there could be a political price to pay for opposing the measures.\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) and its CEO, Wayne LaPierre, have responded to Bloomberg's campaign. LaPierre challenged Bloomberg's plan to spend $12 million on ads aimed at pressuring senators into supporting strict new gun control measures, stating, \"He can't buy America.\"\n\nBloomberg, in response, made clear his intention to counter the NRA's influence, stating, \"I want to make sure the powerful gun lobby is not the only voice in this debate.\" If he can achieve this, Bloomberg said, \"then I think my money would be well spent.\"\n\nLaPierre reiterated his stance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" saying, \"He can't spend enough of his $27 billion to try to impose his will on the American public.\" \"He can't buy America,\" LaPierre added.\n\nMeanwhile, the NRA reported its best fundraising totals in a decade.

The letter, which has since seen at least two signatories distance themselves, and a counter-letter published by another group, expresses concern over the narrowing of free speech boundaries.\n\nThe signatories, who include well-known figures such as J.K. Rowling, Salman Rushdie, and Wynton Marsalis, as well as educators affiliated with universities like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Columbia, have been criticized for their perceived hypocrisy. The letter's focus on perceived censorship in the U.S., while journalists and intellectuals worldwide face more severe challenges, has been a point of contention.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists estimates that at least 250 journalists were imprisoned worldwide last year for their reporting. In the U.S., the Trump administration continues to threaten reporters' safety and undermine the belief in the value of journalism in a democracy. The country is also experiencing an economic recession, impacting industries including journalism and academia.\n\nThe signatories' job losses, referenced in the letter, are not attributed to the pandemic or government pressure, but to actions criticized as potentially harming marginalized groups.

    " Title: Wall Street Journal Staffers Accuse Editor of Suppressing Story Due to Political Bias\n\nArticle:\n\nAn anonymous email circulated by Wall Street Journal staffers on Thursday accused a senior editor, later identified as editor-in-chief Gerry Baker, of suppressing a story and accompanying graphics because they were too liberal. The story, published on Tuesday, examined the country's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and included information on how economic inequality had increased.\n\nThe email urged staffers to begin tweeting the graphics-heavy story at noon, which many did. A Journal spokesman denied that the editor had suppressed the story, stating that the piece was first published on Tuesday and had been online ever since, with additional reporting and analysis to be added.\n\nOne person familiar with the matter told the media outlet that there was a miscommunication, and that Baker had not seen the final version of the story and graphics before they were published. The person disputed the idea that Baker wanted to suppress the story, saying that he wanted to \"put it to the side\" and then resurface it in a more prominent position on the Journal's website once more information was added.\n\nBaker reportedly wanted something \"more exhaustive,\" with more \"macro-economic context,\" according to the source, including \"a lot more on the markets.\" Without that information, he felt that the piece was \"tilting in one direction\" and making it too liberal. A second Wall Street Journal newsroom employee confirmed that Baker was unhappy with the initial version and requested the additional information so that the piece could later be re-launched.\n\nBaker has faced criticism in the past for softening coverage of President Donald Trump. He has denied the criticisms, but claimed that other outlets had been too one-sided in their coverage of the 2016 election. The financial crisis piece published on Thursday, which was reported by Cezary Podkul, examines what has and hasn't changed over the past decade through text, graphs, and images.\n\nThe accusations regarding the proposed changes were made in an anonymously written email sent to colleagues under the name \"Barney Kilgore,\" a reference to the late Journal managing editor who helped transform the paper more than a half-century ago. The email stated, \"This week a senior editor at the Wall Street Journal attempted to take a graphic offline because the facts it contained were not politically palatable.\" The anonymous author proposed \"resurfacing\" the graphics piece on social media, including blasting it out at noon on Twitter.",
    " Title: House Democrats Launch \"Chaos\" Campaign Aimed at GOP Over Budget Impasse\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Democrats are pursuing a campaign strategy centered around the theme of \"chaos\" in an attempt to sway voters' opinions in the 2014 midterm elections, according to The Hill. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) aims to portray the Republican Party as more focused on ideological disputes than on avoiding a government shutdown and safeguarding the nation's credit.\n\nDCCC Chairman Steve Israel told The Hill, \"Americans are fed up with House Republicans' gridlock and obstruction \u2014 but most importantly, they're frustrated with the lack of progress on issues that matter, like working together to create good jobs, protecting Medicare, and reducing our deficit in a balanced way.\"\n\nThe party's primary focus is on the stance of some conservatives who are pushing for a government shutdown over their call to defund the Affordable Care Act, particularly in the House where approximately 80 GOP members seem determined to defy their leadership and obstruct the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Israel stated, \"House Republicans are threatening shutdowns and economic crises if they do not get their way in partisan ideological battles \u2014 and that will be their downfall in 2014.\"\n\nRepublicans, however, believe the strategy will be ineffective, arguing that the public holds all lawmakers accountable for the gridlock in Washington. They also contend that a similar narrative failed in 2011 during the debt ceiling debate. National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Dan Scarpinato told The Hill, \"It sounds to me [what] House Democrats are saying more and more is they're actually rooting for a government shutdown so they can score political points. That's the lowest of the low.\"\n\nScarpinato added, \"The longer House Democrats refuse to be part of the solution to stopping Obamacare and reducing our debt, the more voters are going to reject putting [California Rep. Nancy] Pelosi back in the speaker's chair.\"\n\nTo regain the majority in 2014, Democrats would need to pick up 17 seats, a challenging goal for a midterm election, according to The Hill.",
    " Title: Alabama Senate Passes Near-Total Abortion Ban, Sending Bill to Governor's Desk\n\nArticle:\n\nAlabama's Senate passed a bill on Tuesday night that could impose life imprisonment on doctors who perform abortions, marking one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the United States. The legislation, known as HB 314, amounts to a near-total ban on abortion in the state and is aimed at overturning the landmark Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate voted 25-6 to pass the bill, which would penalize doctors with up to 99 years in prison for performing an abortion. The Alabama House passed the bill earlier this month. The law only allows exceptions to avoid a serious health risk to the unborn child's mother, for ectopic pregnancy, and if the \"unborn child has a lethal anomaly.\"\n\nDemocrats attempted to amend the bill to exempt rape and incest victims, but the motion failed on an 11-21 vote. The bill's consideration made frequent reference to the chamber's dramatic vote last week to drop an amendment that would have made exemptions to abortions performed for instances of rape or incest.\n\nRepublican Governor Kay Ivey, who has previously aligned herself as anti-abortion, has not publicly taken a stance on the bill but has six days to sign the legislation. If signed, the bill would not take effect until six months after becoming law. The American Civil Rights Union of Alabama, the national ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and Planned Parenthood of Southeast have announced their intention to challenge the bill in court should it become law.\n\nThe bill's sponsor, Republican State Sen. Clyde Chambliss, emphasized that the bill impacts women who are \"known to be pregnant\" and provides \"every female that's pregnant or thinks they're pregnant, and the male who was involved, it gives them that window of time -- this bill does not change that window of time.\" The bill outlaws surgical abortions as soon as a pregnancy can be medically determined.\n\nIn a news release, Chambliss stated that his bill outlaws surgical abortions as soon as a pregnancy can be medically determined. Speaking on the Senate floor, Chambliss repeatedly referred to a \"window\" of time between conception and when a woman knows for certain that she's pregnant. The state senator said he believed that time was between about seven and 10 days.\n\nThe bill's consideration sparked heated debates, with Democratic state Sen. Rodger Smitherman questioning what would happen under the bill to a young girl who was a victim of incest and found out she was pregnant. Chambliss responded by stating that he hoped the bill would result in young women learning to seek help quickly if they are abused.\n\nFor more on reproductive rights, tune in to \"United Shades of America\" on Sunday at 10 p.m. ET/PT, where W.

The decision comes as part of a larger review to ensure the company's brands align with their values on racial equality.\n\nThe Eskimo Pie treat was patented by Christian Kent Nelson and Russell C. Stover in 1922, according to Smithsonian Magazine. The brand is the latest to reconsider its marketing in response to the Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd.\n\nQuaker Oats announced earlier this week that it will retire the Aunt Jemima brand, acknowledging the character's origins as a racial stereotype. Other companies are also reviewing their names or logos, including Geechie Boy Mill, which is considering changes to its branding.

The president cited no specific evidence, but noted he had just spoken with Saudi King Salman, who denied that Riyadh was involved.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to get into his mind, but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows?\" Trump said.\n\nThe president said King Salman's denial \"was very, very strong\" and it did not seem as if \"there was a question\" in the king's mind about his claim that Saudi Arabia was not involved.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to try to get to the bottom of it very soon, but his was a flat denial,\" said Trump.\n\nTurkish officials have stated they believe Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on orders from the Saudi government. The journalist, who wrote for The Washington Post and resided in Virginia, visited the consulate on Oct. 2 to get paperwork necessary for his marriage and has not been seen since.\n\nThere have been reports of 15 Saudi agents entering Turkey before Khashoggi arrived at the consulate and leaving the country following the journalist's disappearance.\n\nTrump's comments could spur further controversy surrounding the journalist's apparent death. The incident has sparked a major diplomatic crisis between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, with lawmakers pressuring Trump to take swift action to punish Riyadh.\n\nTrump on Monday dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet with King Salman. The president has previously threatened to impose penalties on Saudi Arabia if it is found to have been responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance, but he said on Monday that he did not raise the issue with King Salman.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t talk about that. We didn\u2019t talk about that. I did say this is very important. The world is watching, the world is talking. This is very important to get to the bottom of it. I think he understands that very well,\" Trump said.\n\nThere was speculation before Trump spoke that Saudi Arabia, which has faced growing pressure over Khashoggi's disappearance, might seek to blame rogue agents, a sign the president could have been repeating something King Salman said.\n\nTrump earlier this year repeated Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election. \"I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,\" Trump said during a press conference with the Russian leader after their July meeting in Helsinki.\n\nTrump has also suggested that others might have been responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee during the campaign, an attack the U.S. intelligence community has unanimously blamed on Russia. Trump appeared to have arrived at that conclusion on his own and not from a conversation with Putin.\n\n\"I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC,\" he said during a September 2016 debate with his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. \"It could be Russia, but it could also be China. Could also be lots of other people. It could also be somebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds, OK?\"",
    " Title: Trump Administration Seeks Supreme Court's Approval for Revised Travel Ban\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to allow the implementation of the revised travel ban, which was previously blocked by two lower court rulings. The administration filed two emergency applications with the nine justices, challenging the decision made by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nIn the filing, the Justice Department argued that the appeals court in Richmond made several errors in ruling against President Trump's travel order. Sarah Isgur Flores, a Justice Department spokeswoman, stated that the ban is lawful. The Justice Department believes that President Trump's executive order is within his lawful authority to ensure national security and protect the United States from terrorism.\n\nThe order, issued in March, bars entry for people from six Muslim majority nations, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, for 90 days while the U.S. implements stricter visa screenings. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had previously called the national security concerns an after-the-fact justification for a policy that was \"intended to bar Muslims from this country.\"\n\nRights groups fighting the policy in the courts have expressed opposition to the travel and refugee bans taking effect. Karen Tumlin, legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, stated, \"Again and again, our nation's courts have found that President Trump's Muslim ban is unconstitutional. We will continue to defend our plaintiffs' right to live free from fear of discriminatory treatment by the federal government.\"\n\nTrump signed his first executive order on travel a week after he took office in January. It applied to travelers from the six countries, as well as Iraq, and took effect immediately, causing chaos and panic at airports as the Homeland Security Department struggled to determine who the order covered and how it was to be implemented. A federal judge blocked it eight days later, an order that was upheld by a 9th Circuit panel. Rather than pursue an appeal, the administration chose to revise the policy.",
    " Title: Senate Proposes Comprehensive Immigration Bill with Merit-Based Green Card Program and Guest Worker Programs\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan group of senators has introduced a comprehensive immigration bill that, if passed, will introduce a merit-based program for awarding green cards to legal permanent residents. The merit system, set to take effect five years after the bill's passage, will allow at least 120,000 foreign-born individuals annually to obtain green cards based on their skills, education, family ties, and length of residence in the United States.\n\nOver a decade, the bill aims to gradually shift the immigration system's focus from the current 75% of visas allocated to family members of immigrants already residing in the U.S. The proposed legislation anticipates that approximately 50% of visas will be distributed based on family ties, while the remaining half will be allocated based on job skills.\n\nThe bill includes border security measures, such as requiring all employers to verify the legal status of new hires using a federal photo-matching system within five years. Additionally, the federal government will be mandated to establish an electronic system within ten years for checking foreigners as they depart through airports and seaports.\n\nThe bill also introduces two new guest-worker programs, one for farmworkers and another for low-wage laborers. Furthermore, it provides employers in technology and science fields with tens of thousands of new temporary and permanent resident visas annually for computer engineers and foreign graduates with advanced degrees from American universities. The current annual caps on temporary high-skilled visas (H-1B) will increase from 65,000 to 110,000, with an additional 5,000 visas for foreign graduates. The cap will gradually rise to 180,000.\n\nThe bill also allows young illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children, often referred to as Dreamers, to become citizens after five years.\n\nThe senators behind the bill hope it will address enough longstanding issues to garner support from a diverse range of groups, including Latinos, religious groups, labor unions, big technology companies, agricultural growers, and immigrant families seeking faster reunification with legal family members.",
    " Title: Skepticism Surrounding Jussie Smollett's Alleged Hate Crime Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nThe alleged hate crime incident involving actor Jussie Smollett, best known for his role in the television show 'Empire,' has been met with skepticism by many outsiders, as the details surrounding the incident have raised questions about its authenticity.\n\nOn January 29, the New York Times reported that Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two assailants who hurled racial and homophobic slurs. The tone of the report, and many others like it, conveyed an absolute certainty about an unconfirmed claim. News outlets such as ABC News, Los Angeles Times, and GQ, among others, reported on the incident with similar certainty.\n\nHowever, the strange circumstances surrounding Smollett's claims have led some to question the veracity of the attack. Chicago's ABC7 News reported this week that \"multiple sources,\" presumably within the Chicago Police Department, had labeled the alleged attack as \"staged\" by Smollett and two accomplices. CBS2 News and the Chicago Tribune made similar reports. A spokesman for the CPD quickly stated that the sources cited were \"uninformed and inaccurate.\"\n\nThe certainty with which the initial reports were made stands in stark contrast to the Times' usual cautious approach to publishing unconfirmed information. The Times would have been on firmer ground if it had simply added six letters - \"says he\" - between the words \"Empire\" and \"was attacked.\"\n\nThe incident has sparked strong reactions from politicians, with Cory Booker, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris, among others, expressing their support for Smollett and condemning the alleged attack. However, some on the political left have expressed doubt about the incident, with some arguing that the publicity surrounding the case may overshadow other, more significant instances of hate crimes.\n\nThe case of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old student who was tortured and killed in Laramie, Wyoming, is often cited as an example of rampant hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community. However, Shepard's case occurred 21 years ago, and some question whether he was killed because of his sexuality. The FBI has logged 7,000 hate crimes in the entire country in the supposed nightmare first year of the Trump administration, with an incidence rate of 0.00002 percent.\n\nSome have suggested that all self-reported hate crimes should be presumed hoaxes, while others argue that reported hate crimes with a \"perfectly crafted narrative\" should be regarded with skepticism until proven true. The media tend to lose interest in hate-crime hoaxes once they are unmasked, but there are many instances of such hoaxes, as can be seen on fakehatecrimes.org.\n\nJournalists and politicians whose priors align with those of activists should be especially cautious about taking at face value claims that seem wobbly, for the good of their own reputations. But it's not just as a journalist that I doubted Smollett's version of events. I doubted it as an American. I decline to look at Chicago (or Kentucky, or Oklahoma, or anywhere else) and put much credence in the idea that vicious Trump-supporting attackers are roaming around looking for minorities to assault.",
    " Title: Trump's Remarks on Sweden Spark Controversy and Fact-Checking by Librarian Emma Johansson\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent rally in Florida, former President Donald Trump discussed his controversial immigration ban, which was halted by federal judges, as well as terror attacks in Europe. The speech, which was lengthy, drew attention for Trump's comments on terrorism in Brussels, Nice, and Paris, cities that have experienced terror attacks in recent months. However, it was his remarks about terrorism in Sweden that caused confusion.\n\nTrump stated, \"You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden \u2013 Sweden \u2013 who would believe this? Sweden? They took in large numbers, they're having problems like they never thought possible.\"\n\nIn response to Trump's comments, hundreds of messages were sent to the Sweden Twitter account, currently managed by Swede Emma Johansson, also known as 'kseenaa.' Johansson, who is participating in the project Curators of Sweden, a 2011 initiative from the Swedish Institute and Visit Sweden, was tasked with correcting the US president's misinformation.\n\nContrary to Trump's claims, all the news in Sweden has been about a music competition, and there have been no terror attacks to speak of. Johansson's fact-checking efforts have since gone viral, with many praising her for her role in setting the record straight.\n\nIt is unclear what specific information Trump was referring to, as the White House has yet to issue a clarifying statement. Some speculate that Trump may have been referring to a Tucker Carlson segment about Sweden on Fox News.\n\nInterestingly, the woman who is gaining attention for fact-checking the US president is a librarian.",
    " Title: Call to Address China's Economic and Intellectual Property Abuses in the Global Trade Arena\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has called for action against the People's Republic of China's economic and intellectual property abuses, citing decades of exploitation of American enterprise and the current global health crisis as evidence of China's relentless and pernicious economic adversarialism.\n\nThe article highlights China's delayed response to the COVID-19 outbreak, with the World Health Organization (WHO) failing to publish information about the human-to-human transmission risk of the virus until December 31, despite intelligence services briefing the U.S. president on the threat on January 3 and multiple subsequent briefings throughout January and February.\n\nThe article also points to China's control of critical products and components in America's supply chains, accounting for 95% of ibuprofen, 91% of hydrocortisone, and 80% of all antibiotics. This dependence on Chinese medicine has reportedly crippled the U.S.'s ability to fight COVID-19 and various illnesses.\n\nFurthermore, the article discusses China's exploitation of intellectual property, leading to the introduction of the SHEET Act to prevent countries such as China from stealing technology and intelligence from educational foreign-exchange programs.\n\nThe article argues that China has been abusive towards American companies since joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, causing supply-chain disruptions for three-quarters of American companies. China's manipulation extends beyond supply-chains, as seen in incidents where companies such as Marriott and Delta changed their maps to appease China's authoritarian regime.\n\nTo counter China's outsized influence, the article suggests creating new supply chains and reinforcing existing ones with U.S. allies in Asia, the Western Hemisphere, and Europe. Policymakers should create new incentives for businesses to reorient supply chains away from China and disincentives for companies to invest there, such as a \"sovereignty tax\" on American investment in China.\n\nAs the pandemic abates, the U.S. and its allies should openly call out China's abuses and work towards ending China's exploitation through a partnership with American, European, and Asian businesses and governments. The article argues that incurring higher costs to be strategically secure is worthwhile.",
    " Title: Jon Stewart Urges Mitch McConnell to Expedite 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund Reauthorization\n\nArticle:\n\nJon Stewart, the former host of the \"Daily Show,\" has called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to expedite the reauthorization of the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund. The fund, established after the September 11 terrorist attacks to aid victims and their families with medical and economic losses, is running out of money and requires reauthorization to continue its operations.\n\nDuring a segment on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" on Monday, Stewart criticized McConnell's comments made in a Fox News interview, where McConnell stated, \"Many things in Congress happen at the last minute... we will address it again. I don't know why he's all bent out of shape.\" McConnell's comment was in response to Stewart's advocacy for the fund's reauthorization.\n\nIn the segment, Stewart addressed McConnell directly, stating, \"Senator, you're not good at this argument thing. Basically, we're saying you love the 9/11 community when they serve your political purposes, but when they're in urgent need, you slow-walk, you dither. You used it as a political pawn to get other things you want, and you don't get the job done completely, and your answer to that charge is, 'Yeah, duh, we're Congress. That's how we do.'\"\n\nStewart urged McConnell to meet with the 9/11 community \"tomorrow as soon as possible,\" stating, \"You can pass this thing as a standalone bill tomorrow. Meet with them. I'm begging you.\" The reauthorization bill, which currently has 320 bipartisan House cosponsors, is expected to pass the House. However, it is unclear if it will pass the Republican-controlled Senate. Previous renewal attempts faced opposition from Senate Republicans who objected to the price tag of reauthorization legislation.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee passed the bill on June 12, and it now goes to consideration by the full House. The bill's progress in the Senate remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Cokie Roberts on Norquist: \"The Emperor Has No Clothes\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent discussion, journalist Cokie Roberts addressed the political implications of adhering to the anti-tax pledge of Grover Norquist, a conservative political activist.\n\nRoberts stated that the association of Republicans with Norquist's pledge could potentially harm their political standing, particularly in the context of tax rate increases. She suggested that if Republicans were heavily involved in a deal that resulted in increased spending and taxes, it could negatively impact a potential re-election bid, as it did for former President George H.W. Bush in 1992.\n\nHowever, Roberts noted that if Republicans cooperate with the president to make 80% of the Bush tax cuts permanent for 98% of the American people, they could still engage in further discussions about higher rates and revenue generation. She considered this a superior position politically and a more advantageous way to shape the discussion.\n\nRoberts also mentioned the concern among some Republicans about the potential political fallout if the fiscal cliff is crossed, a situation they believe would result in blame being placed on them. She also referenced a point made by Tom, suggesting that it is politically smart to cut the ground out from under Norquist, who is seen as a powerful figure in conservative politics.\n\nRoberts further commented on the notion that Democrats, who have recently elected a democratic president, would need to make the vast majority of Bush's tax cuts permanent. She found it surprising that these tax cuts, which were not just rate cuts but cuts across the board, could be made permanent, given their demonization by the Democrats.\n\nRoberts concluded by questioning whether Republicans should take a victory lap for achieving the permanence of most of the Bush tax cuts, even though she expressed skepticism about the political wisdom of raising taxes. She also suggested that undermining Norquist, who is seen as having no political clothes, could be a politically smart move.",
    " Title: Paul Ryan Affirms Plans for Another Term as Speaker of the House, Expresses Support for Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on Green Bay, Wisconsin's WTAQ-AM, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan confirmed his intention to seek another term as speaker, despite speculation that he may step down after the upcoming elections. The speculation, reported in The Hill, suggested that Ryan faces a challenging path to secure the 218 votes necessary for a full two-year term as House GOP leader.\n\nDuring the interview, host Jerry Bader asked Ryan, \"Can you say with 100 percent certainly you seek another term as speaker?\" Ryan, who was calling in from a bus tour of Wisconsin, responded, \"Yes, I can. This is the typical chatter you have every two years that they call 'palace intrigue' in the Hill rags. I am going to seek staying on as speaker.\"\n\nRyan expressed pride in his \"Better Way\" agenda and stated his intention to execute this agenda in the next session of Congress. \"There is a lot of unfinished work to do. I think I can do a lot to help our cause, our party,\" he said.\n\nRyan also revealed plans to be on a bus tour with Sen. Ron Johnson throughout the state and to rally with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the GOP nominee for vice president, in Mukwonago, Wisconsin, on Saturday.\n\nRegarding the upcoming elections, Ryan expressed his support for the Republican ticket, stating, \"Just imagine the scandal baggage Hillary Clinton brings in\u2013if she were to get elected\u2013on top of the liberal-Obama agenda she wants to prosecute.\" He also expressed regret that young people do not remember the challenges the Clinton administration posed in the 1990s, stating, \"This is what life with the Clinton's looks like\u2013there is always a scandal around the corner\u2013then, there is some kind of investigation\u2013you never know what's coming next.\"\n\nRyan further commented on the Clinton family, stating, \"They play the system to enrich themselves through what everyone calls: 'Clinton Incorporated.'\"",
    " Title: Trump Announces Executive Action on Police Reform, Aims to Leverage Federal Funds for Training and Certification\n\nArticle:\n\nAdministration officials have revealed that President Trump's approach to police reform will involve utilizing federal grant money to incentivize local departments to enhance training and certification around a set of national \"best practices.\" Departments that prioritize such goals will be given priority for grant funding, with one senior administration official stating, \"You don't necessarily have to demonize them or withdraw funds.\"\n\nAt the White House on Monday, Trump emphasized the need for \"law and order\" and \"justice,\" stating, \"It's about law and order, but it's about justice also.\" The executive action is the result of months of deliberation by a policing commission established by Trump in late December, before the death of George Floyd, which sparked nationwide protests.\n\nTrump intends to call on Congress to pass legislative reforms on Tuesday, but feels compelled to act to \"turn the anger in the country now into action and hopefully bring some unification and some healing.\" However, Trump's rhetoric in the aftermath of Floyd's death has contributed to deep divisions in the nation, with his emphasis on \"law and order\" and portrayal of many protesters as violent.\n\nOn Monday, Trump called the death of Rayshard Brooks, who was shot and killed by police in Atlanta, \"very disturbing\" and a \"terrible situation.\" Brooks' killing has led to new protests in Atlanta. Trump has criticized Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Washington Governor Jay Inslee for their handling of protests in Seattle, where protesters have taken over several city blocks.\n\nTrump has discussed the situation with Attorney General William P. Barr, but declined to specify any potential steps his administration might take. The pending executive action will be announced at a news conference, where Trump is expected to be joined by law enforcement officials and family members of people killed by police.\n\nRepublican congressional leaders signaled on Monday that legislative reforms to overhaul police practices could slip beyond this month. The Senate GOP package, being primarily drafted by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), is expected to be released later this week. The package is expected to discourage the use of chokeholds by withholding federal funds to police agencies that allow them, but is not expected to explicitly ban the practice.\n\nSen. Scott, the Senate's lone black Republican, said it would be a \"bad decision\" to wait until next month to deliberate on a legislative package. The House Democrats' plan also includes establishing a national database to track police misconduct and prohibiting certain no-knock warrants. The House Judiciary Committee will meet Wednesday to work on the bill.\n\nTrump aides emphasized that the president remains opposed to any legislation that would end qualified immunity for police officers. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stated Monday afternoon on the Senate floor that the Senate GOP is developing a \"serious proposal to reform law enforcement in smart ways without lashing out needlessly and counterproductively at the first responders who are a credit to their communities.\"\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing Tuesday afternoon with law enforcement, legal experts, and government officials. Administration officials did not specify how much federal money could be tied to police training reforms, and they suggested it could be up to Congress to provide additional funding to help create new programs that Trump will outline on Tuesday. Among these programs is a \"co-responder program\" that would pair local police with mental health experts to respond more holistically to reports of crime in communities and in dealing with suspects.\n\nWhen asked how the president envisioned getting around potential objections from police unions, the first administration official acknowledged the executive action would hinge on cooperation from mayors and other local officials. \"The federal government can only do so much,\" the official said.\n\nIn a statement, the National Fraternal Order of Police said it had reviewed a draft of Trump's executive action and found that it \"strikes a great balance between the vital need for public and officer safety, and the equally vital need for lasting, meaningful, and enforceable police reform.\"",

The meeting, which was one of several high-level discussions Trump and his administration had with world leaders, was considered critical due to China's role as North Korea's largest trading partner.\n\nTrump referred to China as a \"great trading partner\" and stated that resolving the North Korea nuclear missile threat may take longer than desired but will ultimately be successful \"one way or the other.\" Xi also spoke briefly, but his comments were not immediately translated and made available.\n\nThe meeting focused on trade and North Korea's nuclear missile testing. Trump expressed concerns about trade imbalances between the United States and China, stating, \"Many things have happened that have created trade imbalances, but we\u2019re going to turn that around.\"\n\nThe meeting was attended by about a dozen top administration officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and adviser Jared Kushner. The meeting followed a long-range missile test launch by North Korea on Tuesday, which a Pentagon spokesman described as a type not previously seen by U.S. analysts.\n\nFollowing the missile launch, Trump expressed frustration with China over its expanding trade with North Korea. He tweeted, \"Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!\"\n\nChina has historically resisted intensifying economic pressure on North Korea due to concerns about instability and potential influx of North Korean refugees. Tillerson, on Tuesday, vowed \"stronger measures\" to hold North Korea accountable and stated that any country aiding North Korea militarily, economically, or taking in its guest workers is \"aid[ing] and abet[ing] a dangerous regime.\" Tillerson also emphasized the need for global action to address the North Korea threat.",
    " Title: Understanding the President's Daily Brief and Its Importance\n\nArticle:\n\nThe President's Daily Brief (PDB) is a concise, daily intelligence briefing presented to the U.S. President and a select group of top officials. This briefing has been a tradition at the White House for over 50 years, with the winner of the presidential election receiving the same briefing during their transition period to prepare for the challenges they will face in office.\n\nHowever, the current President, Donald Trump, has deviated from this tradition by declining to receive the PDB most days, making it more of a weekly occurrence rather than a daily one. Trump's reasons for not receiving the briefing were stated in a recent interview, where he expressed that he does not need to be told the same information daily and that he is a \"smart person.\"\n\nThe PDB, also known as the President and White House staff as the PIC, is considered the most tightly controlled daily document in the world. It originated during the early days of John F. Kennedy's presidency, when the Central Intelligence Agency felt the need for a more organized way to keep the president updated on potential crises and hot spots around the globe.\n\nThe PDB's content is carefully controlled, and the president determines who gets to see it. The circle of individuals who receive the briefing varies between administrations, but it remains a highly exclusive group. The briefing is presented in either a personal or briefing-book format, depending on the president's preference.\n\nU.S. intelligence veteran Barry Pavel, who served in the past two administrations, emphasized the critical nature of the PDB. He stated that the briefing is a \"critical start to their day, where they have this exchange on these critical issues\" and that it \"gets them thinking about what's going to happen that day, that month, or that year.\"\n\nPavel expressed concern about Trump's decision to skip the briefing, stating that a new briefer or approach may be necessary to present the information in a way that works for Trump. He also highlighted the importance of these regular sessions during the presidential transition period, as it helps the president-elect get up to speed on the state of the world and establish a good relationship and rapport with intelligence officials.\n\nIn conclusion, the President's Daily Brief is a critical document that provides the U.S. President with a daily update on potential crises and hot spots around the globe. The briefing is a tradition that has been in place for over 50 years, and while the current President, Donald Trump, has chosen to deviate from this tradition, the importance of the briefing during the presidential transition period and in the White House remains significant.",
    " Title: FCC Shuts Down Austin's Liberty Radio, Known for Alex Jones Broadcasts, Faces $15,000 Fine\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken action against pirate radio station Liberty Radio, known for its broadcasts of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. According to The Austin American-Statesman, the station was fined $15,000 and temporarily removed from the airwaves due to unlicensed broadcasts since at least 2013.\n\nThe newspaper reported that the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Austin, alleged that Liberty Radio, also known as LRN.FM, was transmitting from a tower at an Austin apartment complex without a license. The station stopped airing on the radio in December but continues to stream online.\n\nThe FCC is charging that the station was also illegally broadcasting on an FM wavelength. The Associated Press reported that Walter Olenick and M. Rae Nadler-Olenick were named as the defendants in the lawsuit, and the apartment complex from which the station was transmitting is linked to them.\n\nThe Olenicks reportedly told the FCC that they would not pay the fine and would consider any agency representatives as trespassers. Media reports, including the local Statesman, described the station as Jones's \"flagship\" outlet; NPR reported Thursday that it had picked up the nickname \"Alex Jones Radio\" over the years. The station does air rebroadcasts of \"The Alex Jones Show.\"\n\nHowever, station host Danny Sessom wrote in a Facebook post late Wednesday that media reports describing the station as Jones's \"flagship\" are \"actual fake news,\" noting that Jones did not broadcast from the station.\n\nJones, a conspiracy theorist who founded the site Infowars, has recently been banned by several platforms, including Facebook and YouTube, for allegedly violating their terms of service. Infowars and Jones's content have also been pulled from Spotify and Vimeo, and Twitter placed restrictions on their accounts. Jones has been forcefully criticized for some of the conspiracy theories he promotes. The parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting have sued him for saying the massacre was staged and a cover-up was orchestrated by the parents of the children.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Race Against Time to Avert Fiscal Crisis as Deadline Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Congress is under pressure to avert more than $600 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts, which are set to take effect in less than a week. The predicament is a result of lawmakers' failure to act sooner.\n\nAs the New Year approaches, all sides are expressing hope that the impending January 1 deadline will finally yield an agreement on the looming fiscal crisis. President Obama is expected to return to Washington from his Hawaii vacation on Thursday.\n\nOfficials have reported a \"unanimous desire\" on Capitol Hill, with a few exceptions, to avert the potential catastrophe of income tax hikes, investment tax hikes, defense cuts, and a halt in long-term unemployment aid all at once. However, few are providing specific details on how this might be achieved.\n\nOver the long holiday weekend, there seemed to be little activity on the fiscal crisis front. House Speaker John Boehner's spokesperson confirmed that the president and the speaker did not speak over the weekend. Representatives for the Republican and Democratic Senate leaders also reported \"nothing\" on Monday.\n\nGiven the short timeframe, it is challenging to write and pass a comprehensive budget bill, let alone do so without a clear roadmap.\n\nThe options for averting the crisis diminished last week when Boehner abruptly withdrew his \"Plan B\" proposal from the floor, citing a lack of Republican support. This bill, though fiercely opposed by Democrats, would have extended current tax rates for all but those earning over $1 million.\n\nThe move also effectively halted negotiations between Boehner and Obama toward a broader compromise agreement.\n\nObama's aides and lawmakers are now discussing a scaled-down package as the most likely solution, something that could at least prevent most of the scheduled tax hikes and possibly extend jobless aid. Lawmakers could then resume the debate early next year over the most contentious issues of entitlement cuts and tax reform.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans still need to decide who, if anyone, would see a tax hike next year. Lawmakers also need a bill to work from. The administration official suggested there was more contact in recent days between White House staff and Senate Democratic leadership staff, indicating that new legislation, if proposed, could come from the Senate side.\n\nBoehner, in announcing late last week that he did not have the votes to pass Plan B, called on the Senate to take action. \"At some point, the United States Senate has to do something,\" Boehner said. \"What we were trying to do this week was to basically jumpstart and try to kick into gear some action by the Senate to avert these tax increases going into effect January 1.\"\n\nCongress has been in the position of having to craft an 11th-hour deal on numerous occasions, most recently over the vote to raise the debt ceiling but also on countless budget bills and tax cut extension packages.\n\nThe senior administration official stated that the mounting pressure this week should \"animate\" all sides to come together on a deal.\n\nIf Washington fails to act, however, Americans are facing a historic blow. The rollback of the Bush-era tax rates is estimated to cost the typical middle-income family over $2,000 a year. Another expiring tax provision could cost thousands more. Investment taxes and the estate tax are also scheduled to rise. The automatic budget cuts could impact defense contractors and other businesses that rely on government spending.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has predicted a double-dip recession if the stalemate persists well into 2013.",
    " Title: White House Faces Controversy as Leaked Conversations with Foreign Leaders Emerge\n\nArticle:\n\nA series of leaked conversations between President Donald Trump and foreign leaders have caused a stir, with the information being provided to The Washington Post and The Associated Press in an apparent attempt to embarrass the president. The leaks, which involve the closely guarded secrets of government, have raised questions about the president's ability to maintain confidential conversations with world leaders.\n\nThe leaks, which have been described as an attempt by the bureaucracy to damage Trump, portray him as a disruptive force on the international stage. The specifics of the leaked conversations, including tone and context, are not fully known.\n\nThe leaks have been met with criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, with some arguing that the leaks are an attempt to undermine the president, while others see them as a means of shedding light on the president's diplomatic dealings.\n\nOne of the leaked conversations involved a call between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which Trump reportedly criticized a refugee agreement and accused Australia of seeking to export potential terrorists. The call was abruptly ended after 25 minutes.\n\nAnother leaked conversation involved a call between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, during which Trump reportedly threatened to send U.S. troops to Mexico unless the Mexican military took action to control \"bad hombres.\"\n\nThe leaks have sparked a flurry of activity from White House officials, who have attempted to provide context for the conversations. For example, one source told CNN that Trump was fatigued during the call with Turnbull, while the AP quoted a White House official as saying Trump's remarks about sending troops to Mexico were \"lighthearted.\"\n\nThe leaks have also raised questions about the president's diplomatic style, with some arguing that Trump's blunt and confrontational approach is not conducive to effective diplomacy.\n\nIn addition to the leaks, the White House has also faced criticism over its handling of the raid in Yemen, which resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL. U.S. military officials have reportedly criticized the decision to approve the raid without sufficient intelligence, ground support, or backup preparations.\n\nThe leaks and the Yemen raid have raised concerns about the level of hostility within the government towards the new president, and the challenges that the White House may face in maintaining loyalty among its troops. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will likely play a key role in instilling a sense of loyalty among their respective departments.",
    " Title: Pilgrims and Puritans: Founding of Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay Colonies\n\nArticle:\n\nOn November 21, 1620, a group of English settlers, known as the Pilgrims, landed on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, in a vessel named the Mayflower. The journey from Europe had been arduous, with the ship being a wine carrier poorly converted for passenger use, and the 102 passengers and crew enduring 66 days of harsh conditions.\n\nThe Pilgrims, who were religious separatists, faced challenges not only from the harsh New World environment but also from the other passengers, who were primarily motivated by the pursuit of wealth. This group, later derisively referred to as \"the Saints,\" had established a rudimentary form of government during the voyage, but there was discord over the details.\n\nUpon reaching their destination, which they named Plymouth, the Pilgrims gave thanks for their arrival, a year before the formal observance of Thanksgiving. The ensuing weeks, months, and years saw the initial adversity of living on the Mayflower and in caves and shoddy wooden shacks evolve into a religious community fortified by a strong private enterprise economy.\n\nTwo leaders who played significant roles in this transformation were governors William Bradford of Plymouth and John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay colony, founded in 1630. Bradford, who became governor at 31, was a maverick who deserted his family's church for a separatist faith and became a master weaver in Holland before moving to America. As governor, Bradford implemented private enterprise principles into the colony, repudiating a communal property requirement and paying off loans with high-interest rates.\n\nJohn Winthrop, like Bradford, was a Puritan who had studied law and moved to higher legal positions in London. He, too, found solace in his religious creed, which emphasized man's quest for perfection and the belief that good people could build a model society through continual religious devotion and hard work.\n\nBoth the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies thrived, with few settlers choosing to return to the Old World. The Pilgrims, who lost half their population in the first year due to disease and starvation, expressed their determination to stay, stating, \"It is not as with other men, whom small things could discourage or small discontents cause to wish themselves home again.\"\n\nJohn Winthrop, like the Pilgrims, celebrated his first Thanksgiving in one of his first letters to his wife, expressing his contentment in America: \"I thank God. I like so well to be here, as I do not repent my coming: and if I were to come again, I would not have altered my course, though I had foreseen all these Afflictions: I have never fared better in my life, never slept better, never had more content of mind.\"\n\nThomas V. DiBacco, professor emeritus at American University, is the author of this article.",
    " Title: \"Winter Storm Octavia Hits Eastern U.S., Brings Snow, Cold, and Travel Disruptions\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest winter storm, dubbed Winter Storm Octavia, has caused disruptions across several states in the Eastern United States. The Weather Channel's Jim Cantore and his crew captured the weather phenomenon of thundersnow during the storm.\n\nBoston, which received 16.5 inches of snow over the weekend, was expected to receive a few more inches on Tuesday, but the city will avoid the brunt of the storm compared to less well-equipped areas such as Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and Maryland. Washington, D.C., is bracing for between 4 and 8 inches of snow, with most of it falling early Tuesday and tapering off during the morning commute. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia declared a statewide emergency due to the potential for up to a foot of snow in some areas.\n\nNon-essential travel is discouraged, and thousands of students throughout the region will have an additional day off due to the storm. Bitter cold temperatures are adding to the region's woes, with Washington's high temperature forecast to reach 25 degrees, about 20 degrees below average for the date.\n\nNew England experienced frigid temperatures on Monday, with Mount Washington, N.H., recording a low of -34 degrees with a wind-chill factor of -87. A hiker who activated her emergency personal locator beacon in the state's Presidential Range amid minus-30 temperatures and 100-mph winds was found dead on Monday.\n\nIn Kentucky, a section of Interstate 71 near Louisville closed Monday shortly after the snow started. Parts of the state could see more than a foot of snow, according to the National Weather Service. \"For Louisville, it could be one of the worst (snowstorms) in 10 years,\" said meteorologist Joe Sullivan.\n\nWaterford, Ky., reported 7.5 inches of snow at midday Monday. In Nashville, homeless shelter volunteer coordinator Robb McCluskey expressed concern that a few inches of slush, ice, and snow would keep drivers from bringing people to the shelter and keep church congregations from delivering dinner.\n\nJacksboro, Tenn., reported a midday total of a half inch of ice on the ground. The Weather Channel reported that \"snow, sleet, and freezing rain will make travel difficult, and winter storm warnings have already been posted for almost 47 million people.\"\n\nAtlanta forecasters cautioned about possible black ice for the morning commute after a day of cold rain and overnight temperatures dipping below freezing. Frigid temperatures were reported all across the northeastern United States on Monday, with Erie, Pa., dropping to -18 degrees, tying the city's all-time record low temperature, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAirlines have canceled more than 1,000 flights nationwide on Monday and more than 300 for Tuesday due to the cold and snow. Monday's cancellations were scattered across airports from New England to the Deep South as lingering disruptions from the weekend's blizzard mixed with the latest winter storm.\n\nIn Boston, the 58.5 inches of snow so far this month make February 2015 the city's snowiest month on record, according to the National Weather Service. The city's 2014-15 winter is the third-snowiest on record, with more than 95 inches recorded so far. The city is only 12 inches away from its snowiest winter ever, based on records dating to the 1870s.\n\n\"It's certainly not a record that we want,\" Mayor Marty Walsh told the Boston Herald. \"It looks like a record we can get.\"",
    " Title: Clinton and Sanders Debate in New Hampshire, Highlighting Harmony and Dissonance\n\nArticle:\n\nThe fifth debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, held in New Hampshire on Thursday, marked their first joint appearance as Democratic presidential nomination contenders. With Martin O'Malley having suspended his campaign earlier in the week, the two remaining candidates met on stage for nearly two hours.\n\nDuring the debate, Clinton and Sanders agreed on several issues of current foreign policy and government priorities. Sanders declined to criticize Clinton for her use of a private email server to handle State Department emails, while Clinton demurred when asked to comment on certain tactics of the Sanders campaign.\n\nHowever, the debate also featured moments of conflict, as both candidates highlighted their differences. Sanders, the self-proclaimed populist and visionary, described change as coming when Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell \"looks out the window and sees a whole lot of people saying: 'Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class; start listening to working families.'\" Clinton, on the other hand, presented herself as the nation's pragmatic mechanic, stating, \"I'm interested in making what we have work better.\"\n\nSanders continued to bear in on Clinton's campaign donations and speaking fees from Wall Street and other big business entities. He described the \"business model of Wall Street as fraud,\" facilitated by government officials who had been its beneficiaries. Clinton denounced what she called \"an artful smear\" and challenged Sanders to identify a single vote she had cast or changed to pay off a donor.\n\nOn her six-figure paid speeches, Clinton stated that she had spoken to these groups only about her knowledge of world politics. When asked whether she would release transcripts of those speeches, Clinton replied, \"I do not know the status, but I'll certainly look into it.\"\n\nSanders also came under scrutiny for an ad that featured praise from an Iowa newspaper that had actually endorsed Clinton. Sanders stated the ad never claimed he had received the endorsement, but MSNBC moderator Rachel Maddow noted the ad was titled \"Endorsement.\"\n\nOn foreign policy, Clinton demonstrated fluency and mastery of the field, while Sanders seemed to be in first gear. However, Sanders offered his oft-repeated point: \"She may have the experience, but I had the judgment to vote against the Iraq War.\"\n\nIn terms of the polls, Sanders had opened a 20-point lead on Clinton in two polls publicized just before the debate began. Sanders has traditionally enjoyed a boost in New Hampshire due to his next-door-neighbor status and his long-standing presence in regional politics.\n\nClinton, however, presented a supreme confidence and sunny demeanor, suggesting she saw brighter days ahead, perhaps in voting venues well to the south and west. The campaign moves to South Carolina and Nevada later this month, with a dozen states voting on March 1, most of which are in the nation's Southeast. On March 15, Florida holds a primary that could be make or break for the candidate trailing at that point.\n\nBefore then, there will be at least two more debates between Clinton and Sanders.",
    " Title: Louisiana's Economic Recovery Struggles Spark Debate Over Fiscal Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nLouisiana's economic recovery, while not unique, has sparked a debate among political figures regarding the state's fiscal policy. The criticism of the current policy is directed towards the incumbent governor, Bobby Jindal, who is barred from seeking a third term due to term limits.\n\nOne of the policy's critics is United States Senator David Vitter, a Republican and the current favorite in the governor's race. Vitter expressed concerns about the state's generous and expanding tax incentives and its increasing reliance on one-time sources of revenue to balance the budget.\n\nVitter stated, \"In many ways the economy's doing pretty good, but there's a disconnect because of this broken fiscal policy.\" He further criticized Jindal's approach, saying, \"I don't agree with his general approach.\"\n\nIn response, Governor Jindal defended his record, attributing the state's budget shortfall primarily to the downturn in oil prices. He emphasized that the intention was to shrink the state government, not as an unfortunate side effect, but as part of a deliberate policy decision.\n\n\"We made an explicit decision and commitment that we were going to cut the government, the public sector economy, as opposed to the private sector economy,\" Jindal said, adding that per capita income in the state is at its highest. He further explained, \"We made the intentional policy decision we think it'd be better to shrink government and cut taxes. That's unusual for Louisiana.\"\n\nA movement to reassess tax credits and exemptions, which total more than $1 billion annually, has been gaining momentum in the Republican-controlled Legislature. However, Jindal has expressed firm opposition to any changes that would result in net new revenue. Last year, he vetoed a bill that would have required the state to tally up the costs of those tax credits and rebates, citing potential uncertainty about the state's commitment to job creation and economic development.",
    " Title: Obama Campaign Pre-emptively Criticizes Romney's Foreign Policy Stance Ahead of Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn anticipation of Mitt Romney's planned foreign policy address, President Obama's re-election campaign has launched a pre-emptive critique, alleging that Mr. Romney has failed the commander-in-chief test on the global stage. The Obama campaign released a new television advertisement and issued a memo on Monday, criticizing Mr. Romney's overseas trip this summer and his response to the attacks on the U.S. diplomatic post in Libya.\n\nThe Obama campaign's memo, authored by two former top Obama national security advisers, Michele Flournoy and Colin Kahl, asserts that Mr. Romney's foreign policy positions are outside the mainstream and often to the right of former President George W. Bush. They suggest that this is not surprising, given that Mr. Romney has surrounded himself with advisers who supported the \"with-us-or-against-us approach\" that led to \"some of the worst foreign policy failures in American history, including the Iraq War.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign also challenges Mr. Romney to provide specifics on how his foreign policy approach would differ from the current administration. The memo states, \"Governor Romney still can\u2019t say what he\u2019d do differently on Iran other than taking us to war, he continues to criticize the president\u2019s time line in Afghanistan even while saying he\u2019d pursue it as president, his position on Libya has no credibility since he\u2019s been both for and against our Libya policy, and he offers no way forward on Syria other than suggesting that the United States should get more deeply involved in the conflict without defining a strategy.\"\n\nIn the memo, the Obama campaign also highlights Mr. Romney's stumbling performance during his July trip to Britain, Israel, and Poland. The campaign also cites the criticism of Anthony Cordesman, a national security adviser to GOP Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, who described Mr. Romney's stance on Libya as \"the worst possible reaction.\"\n\nMr. Romney is set to deliver a broad-scale attack on Mr. Obama's handling of foreign policy and national security issues in a speech at the Virginia Military Institute. According to excerpts of the speech, Mr. Romney will touch on some of the topics mentioned in the Obama campaign's memo, arguing that the United States must have a more robust presence in world affairs. He will also warn that the attacks on U.S. diplomatic posts last month are part of a broader struggle that is playing out across the Middle East and represent an effort by Islamic extremists to \"wage perpetual war on the West.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign, in the memo, argues that their president has had a strong national security record, citing achievements such as decimating al Qaeda's leadership, taking out Osama bin Laden, ending the war in Iraq, providing unparalleled support to Israel, producing unprecedented pressure on Iran, strengthening alliances, and restoring the U.S.'s standing in the world.\n\nHowever, the Romney campaign has pushed back, arguing that Mr. Obama has weakened America's standing abroad in the past four years. Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg stated, \"In every region of the world\u2014and particularly in the Middle East\u2014American influence has been weakened by President Obama\u2019s failed foreign policy. American security and the cause of freedom can not afford four more years like the last four years, and Mitt Romney will restore the bipartisan tradition of American leadership abroad that President Obama has not lived up to.\"\n\nIn the new ad released Monday, the Obama campaign highlights critical news reports of Mr. Romney's stumbling performance during his July trip and the biting commentary of Anthony Cordesman, who described Mr. Romney's response to the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya as \"the worst possible reaction.\" The ad concludes with the narrator stating, \"If this is how he handles the world now, just think what Mitt Romney might do as president.\"",
    " Title: Israel, Syria, and Iran Tensions Escalate: Israeli F-16 Shot Down by Syrian Missiles\n\nArticle:\n\nOver the past few hours, actions by Israel, Syria, and Iran have increased the chances of a conflagration. At around 4:30 am on Saturday, an Iranian drone entered Israeli territory from Syria. One of the Israeli military's helicopters intercepted the drone; an Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson added that the drone \"was on a mission.\"\n\nIn response, Israel sent eight fighter jets that morning to strike the area from where the drone supposedly launched, near the city of Palmyra. Middle East security experts, like the Royal United Services Institute's Shashank Joshi, noted this Israeli aerial attack was quite big compared to previous ones.\n\nSyria didn't take kindly to that, however, and it launched anti-aircraft missiles into the sky\u2014an Israeli official confirmed that the munitions hit one of Israel's F-16s. Both of the Israeli pilots in the plane are safe, but one is severely injured due to \"an emergency evacuation,\" according to the Israeli military. Later on Saturday, the Washington Post reported that the Israeli military launched a \"large scale attack\" after one of its jets \"crashed under Syrian antiaircraft fire.\"\n\nOn Saturday night, the White House put out a statement condemning Syrian hostility and affirming its support for Israel: \"Israel is a staunch ally of the United States, and we support its right to defend itself from the Iranian-backed Syrian and militia forces in southern Syria. We call on Iran and its allies to cease provocative actions and work toward regional peace.\"\n\nIt's the first time in years, perhaps since the 1980s, that enemy weaponry brought down an Israeli jet. IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus told CNN that other Israeli planes made it back to base. That might make Israel rethink its flights into Syria in order to drop bombs.\n\n\"The Israeli enemy entity early morning at dawn conducted a new aggression against one of the military bases in the central region,\" the Syrian state news agency SANA said, adding that it hit more than one plane. (Syria has a history of falsely claiming that it downed Israeli aircraft.)\n\nThat led Israel to respond with even greater force: Also on Saturday, it struck at least 12 targets in Syria, including four Iranian military targets in the country. If true, it would be Israel's first direct military confrontation with Iran across the Golan Heights, a demilitarized zone between Israel and Syria.\n\nIsraeli officials say this situation started because of Iran. \"Iran is dragging the region into an adventure in which it doesn't know how it will end,\" Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, Israel's chief military spokesperson, said in a statement. \"Whoever is responsible for this incident is the one who will pay the price.\"\n\nBut Israel faults Syria too. \"The Syrians are playing with fire that they are allowing the Iranians to attack Israel from their soil,\" Conricus told the Washington Post. \"The IDF is ready and capable to inflict a heavy price on anyone that attacks us.\" Israel now says it has the drone and claims it is Iranian.\n\nWhat makes this situation even scarier: Israel says it is \"fully prepared for further action,\" which means things could get worse.\n\nTehran has spent the past seven years fighting to keep Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in power while using the Syrian civil war's chaos to gain more control in the region. Israel, on the other hand, uses military force to curb Iran's influence.\n\n\"Iran is busy turning Syria into a base of military entrenchment,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a news conference last September. \"It wants to use Syria and Lebanon as war fronts against its declared goal to eradicate Israel.\"\n\nOn February 7, Israel fired missiles at a Syrian ammunition depot in Jamraya. That's the location of a suspected Syrian facility that produces chemical weapons.\n\nWe've seen something like this before. Last September, Israeli jets attacked a Syrian military installation near the city of Masyaf that also allegedly produced chemical weapons and advanced missiles. The Syrian Army said two soldiers died. (The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring organization that supports anti-government forces in the civil war, claimed there were at least seven casualties.)\n\nIn a statement after the attack, the Syrian military said there could be \"serious repercussions of such acts of aggression on the security and stability of the region.\"\n\nThe Israeli government didn't comment on that operation. But it became pretty clear that it hit Syria to prevent Iranian ally Hezbollah\u2014a Lebanese militant group that considers Israel an enemy\u2014from acquiring precision-guided missiles to use against Israel.\n\nIsrael has launched around 100 strikes inside Syria over the past five years, according to Amir Eshel, a former chief of the Israeli Air Force. Usual targets include convoys of Syrian military or Hezbollah members.\n\nIsrael is particularly worried about Hezbollah because they have fought before. In 2006, the two battled in a month-long war where the militant group fired more than 4,000 rockets into Israel; in response, Israeli forces fired around 7,000 bombs and missiles into Lebanon.\n\nAround 160 Israelis troops and civilians died, according to the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and about 1,100 Lebanese\u2014most of them civilians\u2014perished, per Human Rights Watch, a US-based advocacy organization. The organization also reports about 4,400 Lebanese were injured, and around 1 million people were displaced.\n\nToday, Israel believes Hezbollah has around 150,000 rockets at its disposal, although those weapons aren't as advanced as the precision weapons made at the facility Israel struck in September 2017.\n\nThat said, what happened last September is nothing like Saturday's events. This most recent flare-up could escalate simmering tensions between Israel, Syria, and Iran even further\u2014something an already roiling Middle East can't afford.\n\nUpdate: This post has been updated to confirm that Syria shot down an Israeli F-16 and to add a statement from the White House.",
    " Title: Puerto Rico, Whitefish Energy, and Power Grid Restoration Efforts Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nPuerto Rico and Whitefish Energy Holdings are defending a $300 million contract awarded to the small Montana company to repair the U.S. territory's hurricane-damaged power grid, following criticism from U.S. lawmakers. The controversy arises as Puerto Rico continues to struggle to restore power to over 80% of the island, a month after Hurricane Maria made landfall.\n\nWhitefish signed a deal with Puerto Rico's quasi-public power utility, PREPA, to help rebuild a grid that was severely damaged by Maria, the strongest storm to hit Puerto Rico in 90 years. The deal was awarded without a competitive bidding process, and despite the fact that Whitefish had only two full-time employees and was established just two years ago. This has led to criticism from legislators who suggest cheaper options may have been available.\n\nGovernor Ricardo Rossello stated that his administration would review PREPA's contracting practices and forward findings to the island's comptroller. Rossello defended the deal, stating that it was necessary to ensure Puerto Rico would have workers in place quickly.\n\nRossello commented, \"Of those (contractors) who met the requirements and aggressive schedules to bring brigades, one was asking for a substantial amount of money - which PREPA had no liquidity for - and another did not require it. That other one is Whitefish.\"\n\nPuerto Rico was already in financial straits before the storm, with a $72 billion debt. As the island works to recover, power restoration is a key challenge, and one of keen interest to contractors and lawmakers alike. Maria left all of Puerto Rico without power when it made landfall on Sept. 20. As of Monday, only 18% had been restored, according to U.S. Department of Energy data.\n\nRossello's comments followed criticism from lawmakers like Democrat Raul Grijalva, the ranking member of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources, who stated, \"Congress needs to understand why the Whitefish contract was awarded and whether other, more cost-effective options were available.\"\n\nWhitefish spokesman Ken Luce called the criticism unfounded, stating, \"Washington's got it backwards.\" Luce added that the firm has been working in Puerto Rico since Oct. 2 and has hired dozens of workers, largely through subcontracts, as it ramps up operations in Puerto Rico.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Defense announced that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has awarded a similar power grid repair contract to a subsidiary of Fluor Corp. Greenville, South Carolina-based Fluor Enterprises Inc beat out another undisclosed bidder for a $240 million construction contract set to run through next April, the DOD stated.\n\nOther companies working on power restoration include JEA, a Jacksonville, Florida-based utility, and representatives from the New York Power Authority. Fixing Puerto Rico's power grid is an enormous task, as Maria would have severely damaged a healthy grid, but Puerto Rico's was in a fragile state after years without maintenance. PREPA has struggled with heavy management turnover and a $9 billion debt load, which led it to declare bankruptcy in July.\n\nPREPA has set aggressive goals for repairs, aiming to restore 95% of power by mid-December, a schedule viewed as ambitious.

    " Title: North Korea Fires Short-Range Ballistic Missile, Third Test Since New South Korean President Took Office\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea launched at least one short-range ballistic missile on Monday, marking the third test since South Korea's liberal President Moon Jae-in took office on May 10. The missile, believed to be a Scud-class ballistic missile, flew about 450 km (280 miles) before landing in the sea off North Korea's east coast, according to South Korean officials.\n\nThe missile test follows two successful medium-to-long-range missile tests by North Korea in the past two weeks. The country has been conducting these tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting the mainland United States.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Roh Jae-cheon stated that the missile reached an altitude of 120 km (75 miles). Roh also noted that the assessment is that there was at least one missile, but the number of missiles is still being analyzed.\n\nNorth Korea, which has conducted dozens of missile tests and tested two nuclear bombs since the beginning of 2016, says the program is necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The White House stated that President Donald Trump had been briefed about the launch, and the U.S. Pacific Command tracked the missile for six minutes and assessed it did not pose a threat to North America.\n\nThe United States has said it is looking at discussing with China a new U.N. Security Council resolution and that Beijing, North Korea's main diplomatic ally and neighbor, realizes time is limited to rein in its weapons program through negotiations. The situation on the Korean peninsula is complex and sensitive, and China has urged all relevant sides to maintain calm and exercise restraint.\n\nJapan lodged a protest against the test missile, which appeared to have landed in its exclusive economic zone. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed action along with other nations to deter Pyongyang's repeated provocations. The issue of North Korea is a top priority for the international community, Abe stated, and working with the United States, they will take specific action to deter North Korea.\n\nSouth Korea's Moon called a meeting of the National Security Council in response to the test launch. North Korea last test-fired a ballistic missile on May 21 and said on Sunday it had tested a new anti-aircraft weapon supervised by leader Kim Jong Un. Experts suggest that North Korea may be testing new capabilities that may be fed into its efforts to build an ICBM. The United States will test an existing missile defense system to try to intercept an ICBM on Tuesday, officials stated last week.",
    " Title: Christie's Political Future in Question Following Bridgegate Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe political future of former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is uncertain following the \"Bridgegate\" scandal, as questions about his involvement and knowledge of the traffic jam conspiracy continue to mount. The scandal, which involved the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge in 2013, has led to speculation about Christie's leadership and potential dishonesty.\n\nOn Thursday, Christie announced that he had fired his deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly, one of the officials at the center of the traffic jam conspiracy, and prospectively fired another confidant from future political jobs. He claimed to have been \"blindsided\" by Wednesday's revelations and insisted that he never detected a whiff of impropriety until the now infamous \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\" emails became public.\n\nChristie stated, \"I am not a micromanager. I delegate enormous amounts of authority.\" If this is true, then he still faces the problem of reconciling his delegatory style with the revelation that he allowed multiple individuals to act with impunity within his inner circle.\n\nIf it is discovered that Christie was not completely unaware of or involved in the scandal, it could be detrimental to his political career. Over the course of two hours, Christie provided several new avenues for inquiry during his press conference.\n\nConservatives who are inclined to defend Christie have resorted to tu quoque defenses, comparing Bridgegate to the Benghazi controversy or the IRS targeting of political nonprofits. However, these comparisons have been met with criticism, as the IRS actions have far graver implications than creating traffic on the George Washington Bridge, and the bad actors in this case were Christie's closest, most trusted aides, not low-level officials in a far-off bureaucracy.\n\nThe authentic, gruff earnestness that Christie exudes and his allies in the national press corps may have helped him escape an at-times incoherent press conference without revealing conspicuous malice. However, the problem for Christie, politically, probatively, and legally, is that the story will eventually settle around one of two conclusions: either he is no better prepared to serve as a politician after two decades in politics and four years as the New Jersey governor, or he is one of the most audacious liars in 21st-century American politics.\n\nThere is little gray area in which Christie might redeem his judgment and managerial skill without admitting that he lied about his knowledge of or involvement in the scandal. The future prospects of Christie's political career have been badly damaged, regardless of the eventual outcome of the investigation.",
    " Title: FBI Modifies Decision, to Release More Details on Clinton Email Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has announced a change in its decision regarding the release of details from its obstruction of justice probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email case. The Justice Department confirmed the new position in a letter on Thursday to Ty Clevenger, a lawyer who had filed an open records request for the information.\n\nInitially, the FBI stated there was not enough public interest to outweigh Clinton's privacy concerns. However, after Clevenger appealed to the Justice Department, they have concluded that the records in question are part of the Clinton email investigation file, which is already being made public in installments.\n\nJustice Department official Sean R. O' Neill stated that the records are being posted at the FBI's \"vault,\" a section of the bureau's website, under the heading \"Hillary R. Clinton.\" The FBI will continue to process and post subsequent releases of responsive records until the entire investigative file is complete.\n\nClevenger interpreted this as the Justice Department overruling the FBI and reversing its earlier decision. Earlier this week, Clevenger won a ruling from a state judge in Maryland who overruled the state bar counsel's office and ordered an investigation into whether Clinton's lawyers should face discipline for their handling of Clinton's emails.\n\nClevenger alleges that by deleting emails that the government later determined were official records and should have been returned to the State Department\u2014and were subject to preservation requests\u2014the lawyers engaged in destruction of evidence.",
    " Title: Virginia Governor's Race: McAuliffe Wins by Narrow Margin, Cuccinelli Campaign Highlights Impact of Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocrat Terry McAuliffe won the Virginia governorship on Tuesday, narrowly defeating Republican Kenneth T. Cuccinelli in a race that was far closer than polls had suggested just days ago. The results of the Virginia gubernatorial election, along with the re-election of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, will be closely studied by candidates heading into the next two federal elections.\n\nIn the two biggest elections of the night - the New Jersey and Virginia governor's races - neither Democratic candidate topped 50 percent. Between purple-state Virginia and deep-blue New Jersey, the Republican candidates combined for 2.2 million votes, or 400,000 more than the Democratic candidates.\n\nThe final results in Virginia were far closer than polls suggested just days ago. At the end of the government shutdown, Mr. McAuliffe held leads of as much as 17 percentage points. However, with the shutdown over, Mr. Cuccinelli and national Republican figures argued that Virginia's election was a referendum on Obamacare - and the polls began to tighten, ending with Mr. McAuliffe's narrow 2 percentage-point victory on Tuesday.\n\nExit polling showed 41 percent of Virginians \"strongly oppose\" the health care law, while only 27 percent \"strongly support\" the law. Of voters who said health care was the most important issue in their vote, Mr. Cuccinelli topped Mr. McAuliffe, 49 percent to 45 percent.\n\nMr. Cuccinelli's big stumble came on social issues, with a large chunk of voters saying abortion was their chief concern, and Mr. McAuliffe overwhelmingly winning those voters, 59 percent to 34 percent.\n\nIn New Jersey, the polling on Obamacare was a little closer, with 34 percent strongly opposed and 23 percent strongly supporting it.\n\nLiberal groups said they welcomed viewing the election night as a referendum on Obamacare, since Virginia did end up going Democratic in both the governor's race and the lieutenant governor's race.\n\n\"Advantage: Obamacare,\" said Americans United for Change, a group run by the former spokesman for the national Democratic Party.\n\nCurrent Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement that the Virginia victories showed just how badly the government shutdown hurt Republicans.\n\n\"Tonight in Virginia, we saw voters reject the extreme tea party politics that caused our government to shut down and drove our economy to the brink of collapse,\" she said.\n\nWhile there's little doubt Mr. Cuccinelli turned off voters, so did Mr. McAuliffe. Exit polling showed just 52 percent said they strongly backed the man they voted for, while 17 percent said they voted for their choice because they disliked the others. Mr. McAuliffe won half of those voters, signaling his margin of victory came not because voters were eager to see him in office, but because they were wary of Mr. Cuccinelli.\n\nA Libertarian candidate, Robert C. Sarvis, won 6.6 percent of the vote, which was well more than the slim margin of victory for Mr. McAuliffe. Mr. Sarvis won almost all of his support from voters who simply disliked the two major-party offerings.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Decide on 2020 Census Citizenship Question\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court will review a lower court ruling that blocked the Trump administration from including a question about citizenship in the 2020 census. The high court will hear arguments for the case in late April, with a decision expected by late June.\n\nInitially, justices were scheduled to hear the case on Feb. 19, but oral arguments were suspended last month. The justices put the matter on hold after a federal district court judge ruled the government could not proceed with its plans.\n\nIn his court opinion, the federal judge stated that the inclusion of a citizenship question would likely reduce the response rate and congressional representation of non-citizens. The judge also ruled that the addition of the question was arbitrary and did not follow proper procedure. The judge cited a law requiring a three-year notice for any plan to add a question about citizenship to the census.\n\nThe Trump administration, however, announced last month that it would appeal the federal court judge's ruling and seek a Supreme Court review. The Commerce Department, which designs the census, had failed to properly analyze the effect the question would have on immigrant households, according to a case brought by a dozen states or big cities and immigrants' rights groups.\n\nThe Commerce Department stated last May that the citizenship question would be added to the 2020 census count in response to a request made by the Justice Department in December 2017. The department argued that the citizenship question was necessary to provide complete and accurate census block level data.\n\nThe census count is required by the Constitution, and its results are used to determine federal spending, as well as the number of congressional seats allocated to each state for the next decade, and the number of electoral votes available from each state.\n\nThe inclusion of the citizenship question has been a contentious issue, with Republicans largely supporting the additional question as a logical step, while Democrats argue that the inclusion amounts to an effort to intimidate immigrant communities and siphon money and electoral power away from them.\n\nThe Commerce Department has pointed out that almost every decennial census between 1820 and 1950 \" asked a question about citizenship in some form.\" The department also stated that the citizenship question would be the same as the one that it asked on the yearly American Community Service (ACS), which is sent to a much smaller percentage of American homes than the actual census.\n\n\"The citizenship data provided to the [Department of Justice] will be more accurate with the question than without it,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last May. \"Which is of greater importance than any adverse effect that may result from people violating their legal duty to respond.\"",
    " Title: The Role of Spouses in Political Campaigns: A Gender Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political arena, the role of spouses, particularly those of female candidates, has been a subject of scrutiny and debate. According to Kelly Dittmar, a professor at Rutgers University who specializes in women in American politics, the presence of a husband can raise questions about the candidate's autonomy.\n\nJennifer Granholm, the first female governor of Michigan in 2003, experienced this dynamic with her husband, Dan Mulhern. In an interview, Mulhern discussed dealing with sexist undertones and implicit bias, including the perception that he was calling the shots, which he emphasized was untrue.\n\nAs the 2020 primary elections approach, Democratic campaign operatives view this as a relatively safe space to begin addressing these questions. However, the focus remains on managing the public's perception of the candidates before delving into the role of their husbands.\n\nJen Palmieri, a former communications director for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, noted that voters have not often seen men in supportive roles in campaigns, especially in executive positions. Only 3% of governors in American history have been women, according to an analysis by Dittmar.\n\nIn the case of the 2020 presidential race, some spouses, such as Jill Biden and Jane Sanders, are already playing significant roles in their husbands' campaigns, as they did in their past campaigns. This presents a challenge in determining how voters want to see these spouses and the role they want them to play. As Palmieri stated, \"There's no playbook for it.\"\n\nThe general election, however, may present a different story, with voters' reactions and President Donald Trump's approach to societal hot buttons being a significant factor. The role and presentation of these spouses during the general election could become a more complex question to navigate.",
    " Title: \"House Represents Ron Paul's \"Audit the Fed\" Legislation for Vote Amidst Pre-Election Bills\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House of Representatives is set to vote on the \"Audit the Fed\" bill this week, a piece of legislation that was a key cause of former Representative Ron Paul. The bill, which aims to audit the Federal Reserve, is one of a series of pre-election bills designed to highlight lawmakers' stances before they return to their constituencies.\n\nFirst introduced by Paul in 2012, the bill garnered significant bipartisan support, passing with a vote of 327-98. However, the bill faced opposition from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who initially supported an audit of the Federal Reserve but later reversed his stance.\n\nPaul, who retired from the House after the last Congress, is no longer in office, but the current House version of the legislation is sponsored by Rep. Paul Broun, a Georgia Republican. Broun's version of the bill cleared the House Oversight Committee in July, suggesting continued bipartisan support.\n\nThe bill, if passed, would order the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congress's chief investigative arm, to review the Fed's decision-making, particularly on monetary policy. The Federal Reserve, established nearly a century ago, acts as a lender of last resort to the country's banking system and is charged with fighting inflation and promoting economic growth and employment.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the bill would cost about $5 million for the staff required to conduct the audit, with the Federal Reserve spending additional money complying with the review, resulting in approximately $3 million in lower revenue from the Fed over the next decade.\n\nPrevious Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke opposed the audit, stating it could lead to politicians second-guessing the secretive board's decisions. When Paul's bill came up for a vote in 2012, Bernanke called it a \"nightmare scenario.\"\n\nPaul's son, Senator Rand Paul (Kentucky Republican), has a companion bill in the Senate, but it has not seen any action due to Democrats controlling the chamber. Despite Democratic leaders' opposition, a number of rank-and-file Democrats support the legislation.\n\nNineteen Democrats in the House are co-sponsors of Broun's bill, and in the Senate, Senator Mark Begich (Alaska Democrat) is a co-sponsor. Begich has even publicly supported the legislation during a recent Senate campaign debate.",
    " Title: President Obama and Congressional Leaders at Odds Over Student Loan Interest Rate Hike\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a renewed effort to address the impending increase in student loan interest rates, President Obama criticized congressional Republicans for inaction on the issue during a White House event on Thursday. The interest rates on federal Stafford student loans are scheduled to double on July 1 if Congress takes no action.\n\nPresident Obama stated, \"We've been stuck watching Congress play 'chicken' with another deadline.\" He emphasized that there are still 10 days for Congress to take action and avoid the rate hike. The average student would face approximately $1,000 in additional interest payments due to the rate increase, according to the White House.\n\nRepublican leaders, however, accused the White House of ignoring their proposed solutions to the stalemate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, stated, \"We proposed multiple good-faith solutions to this problem before it's too late.\" He added that the administration has yet to respond to these proposals.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney stated that the administration has been working \"broadly\" with lawmakers but declined to name any specific Republicans with whom they have been in contact. Carney emphasized that the administration has made every effort to resolve the matter.\n\nThe issue of student loan interest rates has become a point of contention, with Republicans accusing President Obama of exploiting the issue for political gain during his reelection campaign. President Obama, in response, stated that Congress has largely ignored his entreaties and that the issue should have been resolved weeks ago.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, expressed optimism that an agreement could still be reached before the deadline, stating that discussions over the past two days have been productive. However, he acknowledged that Congress is not yet at an agreement.\n\nThe debate over the cost of subsidizing the student loans has been a contentious issue, with both parties offering proposals. The House of Representatives passed a student-loan bill that would take money from a preventative health care fund, but the fund is not specifically designated for women's health care programs. The White House has proposed cutting the same program.\n\nIn the midst of this debate, President Obama repeated a claim that has been debunked, stating that House Republicans want to pay for student loans by cutting funding for women's health care programs. This claim has been disputed, as the preventative health care fund is not specifically designated for women's health care programs.\n\nAs the deadline approaches, both parties continue to negotiate a solution to the student loan interest rate issue. The potential impact on millions of students hangs in the balance.",
    " Title: Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring Admits to Blackface Incident, Adding to Virginia Governor's Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nVirginia Attorney General Mark Herring, the third in line to the governorship following the recent scandals involving Governor Ralph Northam and Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, admitted to a blackface incident from 1980 on Wednesday. In a statement, Herring explained that he and his friends attended a party dressed as rappers, wearing wigs and brown makeup.\n\nHerring expressed profound apologies for his actions, calling them \"inexcusable\" and insensitive but not reflective of his current self. Ordinarily, this admission might have ended Herring's career, but the current political climate in Virginia's Democratic Party is unpredictable due to the multi-layered race and sex scandals.\n\nThe crisis began last week when a photo of Governor Northam's med-school yearbook page, showing a man in blackface next to a man dressed as a Klansman, was unearthed. Northam initially admitted he was one of the men in the photo, but later backtracked during a press conference, suggesting he wasn't either man and resisting calls to resign.\n\nLieutenant Governor Fairfax's role in the current leadership crisis is significant due to the sexual assault allegation against him. If the top three Democrats in Virginia become untenable, the fourth in line to the governorship would be House Speaker Kirk Cox, a Republican.\n\nBoth Northam and Fairfax have responded defensively. Northam is reportedly hiring a private investigator to investigate the origin of the yearbook photo, while Fairfax has accused his political enemies of orchestrating a smear campaign. Fairfax's future was further complicated on Wednesday when Dr. Vanessa Tyson, a professor at Scripps College in California, detailed an alleged sexual assault incident involving Fairfax in 2004.\n\nAccording to Tyson, she and Fairfax interacted as colleagues during the Democratic National Convention in 2004. When they went to Fairfax's hotel room to retrieve documents, Tyson alleged Fairfax kissed her, and though she was receptive, she did not intend to engage in sexual activity. However, she alleged Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex, despite her \"obvious distress.\" Tyson stated she \"suffered from both deep humiliation and shame\" for years afterward.\n\nFairfax has not yet responded to the allegations publicly. The future of Virginia's political leadership remains uncertain as the events unfold.",
    " Title: Obama's Future Relevance: A Look at the President's Remaining Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference following the midterm elections, President Barack Obama expressed optimism and a cooperative tone towards the newly elected Republican majority in Congress. He stated, \"I told them both that I look forward to finishing up this Congress's business and then working together for the next two years to advance America's business.\"\n\nThe president's optimistic tone is likely a strategic move to maintain relevance in the face of a significant Republican victory. The question arises as to whether Obama is still relevant, given the historic scale of the Republican victory.\n\nWhile a president's relevance is not easily diminished due to the power of the office, history offers a notable example in former President Ronald Reagan. In 1986, Reagan's party also lost the Senate and the House, yet his final two years were marked by significant achievements, such as the INF Treaty with Mikhail Gorbachev and the 1986 Tax Reform Act.\n\nHowever, it is unlikely that Republicans will seek to replicate the Iran-Contra hearings in an attempt to make Obama politically irrelevant. Such an attempt would be met with strong opposition, potentially labeled as politically counter-productive and divisive.\n\nIn foreign policy, Obama's ability to lead has been questioned, with few significant achievements to his name. Domestically, his signature policy, Obamacare, is likely to face opposition, and the president's inability to reach across the aisle over the past six years has limited his ability to pass legislation.\n\nIn the coming years, Obama's main source of impact may come from unilateral overtures, such as executive orders, and shaping the courts through appointments and judicial decisions. The long-term impact on issues like religious freedom could be significant, particularly if Obama is able to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with a leftist in the mold of Elena Kagan.\n\nIn conclusion, while President Barack Obama remains relevant, his ability to implement his agenda is likely to be limited, with his main source of impact coming from unilateral actions and shaping the courts. The question of his relevance is complex, with his own ideology and psychology playing a significant role in shaping his ability to lead and achieve bipartisan success.",
    " Title: Thousands of Pro-Democracy Protesters in Hong Kong Call for U.S. Intervention, Citing Support from Defense Secretary Mark Esper\n\nArticle:\n\nThousands of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, wearing black shirts and masks, marched to the U.S. Consulate on Sunday, chanting the U.S. national anthem and calling on President Donald Trump to \"liberate\" the Chinese-ruled city. The protesters, who also waved American flags and carried posters reading \"President Trump, please liberate Hong Kong,\" were met by riot police and their demonstration turned violent later in the day.\n\nThe protesters' actions come after U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper counseled Beijing to use \"restraint\" in its dealing with Hong Kong, a British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Esper stated at a press conference in Paris on Saturday that the U.S. would urge \"restraint and not to act, and to sit down and talk with the protesters and resolve the differences.\"\n\nThe Sunday protests began peacefully but later turned violent when police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds that converged on the city's Central District, where banks, jewelry stores, and high-end clothing shops are located. The demonstrators smashed windows, vandalized a subway station, ignited fires in the street, and put up barricades.\n\nThe city has been in a state of turmoil throughout the summer, prompted by an extradition bill that would have allowed suspects in semi-autonomous Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam last week said she was formally withdrawing the bill, but it did little to discourage the protests that have since turned into calls for more democratic reforms.\n\nPanzer Chan, one of the organizers of the march, told the Associated Press that Hong Kong is \"at the forefront of the battle against the totalitarian regime of China.\" Chan urged President Trump to \"support us in our fight.\" The exact nature of the support being sought by the protesters is unclear.",
    " Title: Paul Ryan Emerges as Key Figure in Washington's Budget Standoff\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Republican Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin has emerged as a key figure in the ongoing budget standoff in Washington, D.C. After keeping a low profile, Ryan has successfully appeased House Republicans and engaged President Barack Obama in as little as 48 hours, a feat that is near impossible in the current climate of extreme partisanship.\n\nRyan, who was the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012, has managed to move demands by tea party-aligned House Republicans on government funding and debt away from Obamacare, enabling House Republicans to propose an approach on the fiscal impasse that has not yet met President Obama's chief requirements but has not halted negotiations.\n\nDuring a meeting at the White House, Ryan stepped in and changed the tone of the meeting. The two sides had seemed to be talking past each other, but Ryan's intervention resulted in a more cooperative atmosphere. Ryan conceded that his side would not get all it wanted, while Obama asked how he could make something happen.\n\nRepublicans left the meeting expressing optimism, motivated to get to work. The White House admitted progress. However, it remains to be seen if Ryan can push a deal over the finish line.\n\nRyan's role in the negotiations is significant, as House Speaker John Boehner has been unable or unwilling to reach a deal with the President amid the shutdown. Boehner and Obama have a fractured history of bitter negotiations.\n\nIn contrast, Ryan and Obama have a different relationship. While they were fierce competitors during the presidential election, they remain political foes. Despite their public criticisms and derogatory remarks during the campaign, they seem to have maintained a professional relationship.\n\nThe last time they worked together was six months ago during the last budget battle in March. Obama invited Ryan and his Democratic counterpart, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, to lunch. It was the first time Obama and Ryan had sat down together since the presidential race.\n\nVan Hollen said at the time that \"their relationship is developing.\" One of their first public encounters, however, was mixed. When Obama invited himself to a Republican retreat in Baltimore in 2010, he took questions from the members while the television cameras rolled.\n\nRyan introduced himself as \"a ranking member of the Budget Committee,\" indicating he was unsure if the president knew who he was. After a back-and-forth about the budget, the president abruptly cut Ryan off, ending the discussion.\n\nObama later complimented Ryan, saying, \"I think Paul Ryan is a pretty sincere guy and has a beautiful family.\" Obama joked, \"And by the way, in case he's going to get a Republican challenge, I did not mean it. Do not want to hurt you, man.\"\n\nFast forward to today. While they have been on different sides of nearly every debate, their relationship is not broken. In today's Washington, that's saying a lot.",
    " Title: Romney's Shift in Stances: A Look at the Presidential Candidate's Evolving Positions\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, is set to participate in the third and final presidential debate on Monday, an opportunity to further showcase his evolving political positions. The debates, with their large television audiences, have provided Romney with a platform to adjust some stances, soften others, and present himself as a more moderate candidate compared to his primary contest image.\n\nIn March, Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom famously foreshadowed these changes when he told CNN, \"Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all of over again.\"\n\nSome of Romney's \"Etch A Sketch\" moments include his call for boosting Pell Grant funding, a reversal of his criticism of President Obama's increases. Additionally, Romney now supports keeping parts of the national health care law and has indicated more flexibility on legalizing young illegal immigrants and abortion.\n\nPresident Obama, on the campaign trail, has poked fun at Romney's perceived shift, referring to him as \"Moderate Mitt.\" Obama diagnosed the \"condition\" as \"Romnesia,\" warning college students in Virginia that Romney will say anything to get elected and cannot be trusted, repeating the \"flip-flopper\" charge that has dogged Romney, thanks to his support of an individual health care mandate in Massachusetts and his evolution on abortion and gun rights.\n\nDespite the criticism, Romney's move towards the political center seems to be paying off, as polls show him even or ahead of the president. Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, stated, \"Romney has more flexibility to maneuver than almost any presidential nominee I can think of. He'd be crazy not to take advantage of this fact. And he's not crazy.\"\n\nRepublican strategist Ford O'Connell agreed, stating that Romney is trying to woo single-issue voters and to narrow Obama's lead among the coalition of voters\u2014women, Hispanic, and young voters\u2014that propelled the Democrat to victory four years ago.\n\nRomney has vowed to \"keep our Pell Grant program growing\" and to keep the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as covering pre-existing conditions and allowing young people to stay on their family plan. He has also promised not to \"reduce the share that's being paid by the highest-income taxpayers.\"\n\nIn terms of immigration, Romney has softened his stance before the first debate, telling The Denver Post that he would not immediately deport the illegal immigrants granted temporary legal status under Obama's nondeportation directive. He also told The Des Moines Register's editorial board that he has no legislation in mind regarding abortion that would become part of his agenda, a direct appeal to female voters in swing states.\n\nRomney's vagueness on some issues, such as the National Defense Authorization Act and immigration, has irritated some people. Michael F. Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, stated, \"He won't be nailed down; he wants ambiguity. And even if you did, his word is a poor predictor of his thoughts and future actions because he's Mitt Romney.\"\n\nFrank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, which advocates for immigrant rights, said that when it comes to immigration, Romney is \"trying to put lipstick on the pig.\"\n\n\"The pig, his policies, amount to this: All but young undocumented immigrants who serve in the military should be forced out of the country. His rhetoric is this: I want permanent solutions on a bipartisan basis,\" Sharry said. \"He's got the fog machine on in hopes that Latino immigrants will think he's actually going to do something for them. But they get this issue better than the Boston brain trust. They get he actually wants to do something to them.\""
