    " Title: Colin Powell Criticizes Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in Leaked Emails\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Colin Powell, in a series of leaked emails, has criticized both Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The emails, obtained by the website DCLeaks.com and first reported by Buzzfeed News, reportedly have ties to Russian intelligence services, according to a federal law official.\n\nIn a June 17 email to a former aide, Powell called Trump a \"national disgrace\" and an \"international pariah,\" stating that the Republican presidential contender was \"in the process of destroying himself, no need for Dems to attack him.\"\n\nIn an Aug. 21 email to the same former aide, Powell criticized Trump for spurring the \"racist\" so-called \"birther\" movement, a consistently debunked rumor that President Barack Obama was born in another country.\n\nPowell also dismissed Trump's stated overtures to African-American voters, writing, \"There is nothing he can say that will sway black voters so he might as well say it to white folks.\"\n\nIn the same day's email to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Powell called the ongoing investigations into the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate and another facility in Libya that left four Americans dead, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens, a \"stupid witch hunt.\"\n\nPowell, in a 2015 email to Rice, also criticized Clinton, stating, \"Basic fault falls on a courageous ambassador who thought Libyans now love me and I am ok in this very vulnerable place. But blame also rests on his leaders and supporters back here. Pat Kennedy, Intel community, DS and yes, HRC.\"\n\nThe House Select Committee on Benghazi report released in June found an array of bureaucratic miscues and inter-agency blunders but does not specifically blame Clinton.\n\nThe revelations mark the latest in a string of headlines around Powell's email correspondence. His online activity has figured heavily in the controversy around Clinton's use of a private email server.\n\nPowell expressed frustration about his name being linked to Clinton's email issues, writing in another leaked email, \"I have told Hilleary\u2019s [sic] minions repeatedly that they are making a mistake trying to drag me in, yet they still try.\"\n\nIn July of 2015, Powell complained to his broker at Merrill Lynch that questions raised about Clinton\u2019s email and speaking fees impacted his life, stating, \"I had a gig cancelled because the client, a public university, caught hell from overpaying HRC.\"\n\n\"HRC is the gift that keeps on taking,\" Powell wrote in the July 1, 2015 email, according to the leaked documents.\n\nIn a 2014 email, Powell, not referring to Clinton by name, described her as having \"unbridled ambition, greedy, not transformational\" along with some colorful references to her husband's rumored philandering, rumors he attributed to the New York Post.\n\nWhile Powell has described himself as a lifelong Republican, he twice endorsed Obama, a Democrat, for president.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Opposition to ObamaCare-Tied Medical Device Tax Prompts Calls for Delay\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of U.S. senators, including Democrats and Republicans, have expressed concerns about a 2.3 percent tax on medical devices that is set to take effect on January 1, 2013, as part of the Affordable Care Act. The tax aims to raise nearly $30 billion over the next decade.\n\nThe senators, led by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and North Carolina Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, wrote a letter to Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid on Monday, urging a delay in the implementation of the tax. They argue that the tax could harm the medical technology industry, which directly employs over 400,000 people in the United States and is responsible for 2 million high-skilled manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe lawmakers contend that the tax could cause significant uncertainty and confusion for businesses, and they urge Reid to support a delay in enactment in a fiscally responsible manner. They also argue that the tax could hurt the U.S.'s global leadership position in the medical technology industry and potentially lead to job losses.\n\nIt is unclear whether any changes to the planned tax could be included as part of a broader deal to avert the looming fiscal crisis. The Republican-controlled House already voted to repeal the tax over the summer, but the Senate has not taken it up.\n\nRepublican Georgia Rep. Tom Price has also called for the tax to be repealed, stating that it could serve as a common ground for both parties in efforts to serve the American people. Stephen J. Ubl, president of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, has also expressed concerns, stating that the tax could cost thousands of jobs and hinder the ability of medical technology companies to find tomorrow's treatments and cures.\n\nThe tax would apply to a broad range of devices, including X-ray machines, ultrasound equipment, and pacemakers. Equipment makers argue that the tax, which is based on gross sales, could end up being much higher than 2.3 percent. One industry spokesman with Indiana-based Cook Medical estimated earlier this year that the actual impact on earnings is more like 15 percent. Cook Medical also announced earlier this year that it was scrapping plans to open five new plants due to the tax.\n\nDozens of other CEOs have issued similar warnings, stating that the looming tax could put whole companies out of business. However, the administration has defended the provision, arguing that the medical device companies could benefit from the law due to the increased demand for equipment from the millions of new health care customers insured as a result of the law.",
    " Title: Trump's Rhetoric and Media Bias: A Neutral Analysis of the Relationship Between President Trump and the Media\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent rally in Phoenix, President Donald Trump deviated from his prepared remarks, launching into a 30-minute tirade against journalists. The President's rhetoric during this rant drew comparisons to the character Joe Pesci portrayed in the movie \"Goodfellas,\" with some noting similarities to a Queens-born \"wise guy\" rather than a dignified occupant of the Oval Office.\n\nThe comparison between Trump and Pesci is not an assertion of the President's criminality but rather a reflection of the impassioned, sometimes combative tone in Trump's speeches.\n\nThe author, a former journalist at CBS News for 28 years, notes that he has witnessed liberal bias and elitism in the media during his career, but he never saw anything resembling the \"fake news\" that Trump frequently decries. He emphasizes that he never encountered journalists fabricating stories out of thin air.\n\nDuring the Phoenix rally, Trump accused journalists of attributing stories to unnamed sources that do not exist. While there have been instances of journalists making up quotes from nonexistent sources, such occurrences are extremely rare. Trump's characterization of \"fake news\" as news he dislikes has been a recurring theme in his criticism of the media.\n\nThe author also addresses several high-profile media errors since Trump took office, such as CNN's erroneous report in early June that former FBI Director James Comey would contradict the President's assertion that Comey had informed him he was not under investigation. The story was retracted, and three of CNN's top investigative reporters resigned.\n\nIn late June, CNN published a story alleging ties between Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci and a Russian investment fund under investigation by the United States Senate. The story was later retracted, and the network's top investigative reporters resigned. The New York Times reported that the incident was an \"embarrassing episode\" for CNN, particularly given the widespread mistrust in the media and Trump's regular attacks on the press.\n\nThe author argues that while the CNN journalists did not fabricate the story, their biases may have contributed to mistakes. He suggests that introspection and acknowledging biases are not strong suits among journalists, who often circle the wagons rather than examining their biases and their impact on news coverage.\n\nThe author concludes by emphasizing the importance of objective journalism in a free country, where people rely on reporters to be honest brokers of information and to hold powerful individuals accountable. He calls for both Trump and the media to exercise greater fairness in their dealings with each other, acknowledging that both parties have shortcomings.\n\nThe author also criticizes the media for abandoning their role as objective observers and taking on the role of anti-Trump activists, which he argues undermines public trust in the media. He suggests that shouting about \"fake news\" is no way to deal with a press that Trump dislikes, and that proclaiming \"fake innocence\" is no way to deal with a president that reporters dislike.",
    " Title: U.S. Forces Korea Leads the Way in Addressing Racism in the Military\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Forces Korea, led by Army Gen. Robert B. Abrams, has taken a leading role in combating racial injustice and discrimination within the American military. The command has allowed at least two major demonstrations on military bases, banned Confederate flags, and initiated listening sessions, social media events, and question-and-answer forums to hear service members' experiences with discrimination.\n\nThe steps began shortly after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died while in Minneapolis police custody last month. By June 15, Gen. Abrams issued guidance banning the Confederate flag, stating it \"has the power to inflame feelings of racial division\" and must be outlawed.\n\nGen. Abrams' actions have been praised by numerous specialists and retired military officials for addressing the issue swiftly, a concern the Pentagon has often been slow to address. The military, they say, will be stronger for this.\n\nTop leaders at the Pentagon, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark A. Milley, have also been outspoken on the issue, launching reviews and directing internal investigations into promotion practices and other areas where Blacks could face discrimination.\n\nHowever, lasting change must take root at lower levels of the military, according to specialists. Leadership from officials such as Gen. Abrams is crucial in setting a standard that all are equal and suppressing any racist tendencies.\n\nRetired Army Lt. Col. Daniel L. Davis, who served as a U.S. adviser to the Second Republic of Korea Army, commended Gen. Abrams, stating, \"It sets a standard that we are all equal here... We all have to pull together, work together as a team. It has a suppressive effect on anybody who may harbor these racist tendencies.\"",
    " Title: Romney's Potential Reaction to Supreme Court's Decision on Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who previously implemented a state-level health care law similar to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), may have a different reaction to the Supreme Court's decision on the federal law compared to other Republicans. There is concern among some GOP circles that if the court strikes down Obamacare, Romney may lose a key issue to rally conservative voters, who have been difficult to inspire.\n\nRepresentative Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) stated, \"Clearly, the Supreme Court overturning Obamacare is the best thing for the country, but it\u2019s an open question what\u2019s better for November\u2019s election. If the law is upheld, it might drive our people out to the polls.\"\n\nAs the justices prepare to rule this month, both political parties are strategizing on how to position their candidates following the decision. House Republican leaders have been planning a unified GOP response, regardless of the outcome. The White House, with both President Obama's political standing and his signature achievement at risk, is hoping for the law to be upheld in its entirety.\n\nHowever, Republicans are considering the possibility that a significant blow to the law could energize Obama's base and diminish the urgency of their own activists. A conservative operative involved in the campaign stated, \"Obamacare is the one permanent and potentially irreversible [effect] that Obama will have on the country, and if it is overturned, it makes the election, by default, less important.\"\n\nA CBS/New York Times poll released Thursday found that more than two-thirds of respondents believe the law should be struck down in whole or in part. A ruling against Obamacare could provide Romney, who has campaigned to repeal the law, with a clearer contrast with Obama on health care. On Thursday, Romney stated, \"As president, I will work from my first day in office to dismantle Barack Obama\u2019s federal health care takeover and replace it with real reform that strengthens our health care system and puts patients first.\"\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have been discussing the potential outcomes and their effects on the November election, with several lawmakers debating the political implications. Representative Patrick Tiberi (R-Ohio) stated, \"I could argue it both ways, and I have argued it both ways. I could see the president, if the mandate is thrown out, using it to rev up his troops.\"",
    " Title: Network Personalities Adapt to Social Distancing Measures Amid Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, network personalities are adapting their filming arrangements to practice social distancing. This includes remote work or filming from different parts of the same studio.\n\nOne of the top-rated morning shows on cable news, Fox & Friends, has seen changes in the interplay between co-hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, and Brian Kilmeade, who usually sit on a \"curvy couch\" in a studio in Manhattan. On Tuesday, only Doocy sat on the couch, while his co-hosts sat in other parts of the same studio, one level down.\n\nKilmeade explained, \"To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart.\" Doocy added, \"We're doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is: Stay away from each other, because you don't want to get infected, and you don't want to spread infections.\"\n\nSimilar adjustments have been made on other networks. On MSNBC, Morning Joe personalities Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski, and Willie Geist beamed in from different locations on Tuesday. On CNN, New Day co-hosts Alisyn Camerota and John Berman sat at the same desk, but several feet apart, in line with the recommended six feet of separation guideline.\n\nRepresentatives for Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN have all confirmed that their on-air staffers are practicing social distancing. At MSNBC, guests who come to the network's 30 Rock headquarters in New York for on-camera appearances will do so from a \"separate location,\" the network said. On-air staffers who sit at the same desk will always be at least six feet apart.\n\nOn Monday, MSNBC anchor Joshua Johnson highlighted the distance between himself and the other people on his panel. \"You may have noticed if you've been watching these specials for the last few days that we've been all at this one table,\" he said. \"We're not doing that anymore.\"\n\nAcross the television news industry, shows have cut out live audiences. At least one prominent host, The View co-host Joy Behar, has taken a temporary leave from her perch out of concern about potentially contracting the illness.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Today show host Al Roker beamed in live from his kitchen after he and fellow host Craig Melvin went into self-quarantine after a staffer on the third hour of the show's franchise tested positive for the virus. \"I didn't have to commute in, so I did sleep in,\" he said.",
    " Title: Speaker Paul D. Ryan Announces Retirement from House of Representatives\n\nArticle:\n\nSpeaker of the House Paul D. Ryan (R-WI) announced on Wednesday that he will retire from Congress at the end of this year, marking the conclusion of a two-decade political career. The announcement was made at a press conference in the morning following a private disclosure to colleagues during the weekly House Republican meeting.\n\nRyan cited family commitments as the primary reason for his decision, stating, \"If I am here for one more term, my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend dad. I just can't let that happen. So I will be setting new priorities in my life.\"\n\nDespite speculation that the GOP may face a challenging midterm election in November, Ryan expressed confidence in the party's ability to maintain control of the House, citing a strong economy and significant legislative achievements. He also emphasized his intention to remain active as a lame-duck speaker, stating, \"I'm not done yet. I intend to run through the tape.\"\n\nRumors of Ryan's departure had circulated for months, and he and his aides had consistently denied them. Several lawmakers are expected to compete for Ryan's succession, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and House Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).\n\nRyan has served as speaker for a little over two years and has overseen a turbulent period, facing down conservative rebellions and securing a large tax cut, but failing to repeal Obamacare. His efforts to rewrite the federal budget to bring more accountability to social spending programs have also faced opposition, even from within his own party.\n\nIn the past, Ryan has been a prominent critic of President Trump during the 2016 campaign, but he has since become the president's most effective ally on Capitol Hill, helping to push the White House agenda. President Trump tweeted after the news broke, \"Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!\"\n\nDemocrats expressed hope that Ryan, now free from having to face voters, would turn on President Trump and his colleagues. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) stated, \"With his newfound political freedom, I hope the Speaker uses his remaining time in Congress to break free from the hard-right factions of his caucus that have kept Congress from getting real things done.\"\n\nRepublicans, however, expressed doubt that Ryan's retirement would significantly alter the political landscape. Representative Kevin Brady (R-TX), who succeeded Ryan as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, stated, \"We're going to continue to rally behind him. I think the main reason for this is his family. He's never been a lifer.\"\n\nRyan faced a tougher-than-usual election fight back home in Wisconsin this year, with several Democrats vying to challenge him. Kyle Kondik, of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, stated that the announcement gives Democrats a much better shot of picking up the seat, which Ryan has held since 1999.\n\nRyan faced a challenge for the seat from Paul Nehlen, a man with white supremacist ties who was severed by the state party in 2018 and had his Twitter account suspended for anti-Semitism.",
    " Title: Trump's Meeting with Evangelical Leaders May Signify a Shift in Voting Tendencies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a strategic move to secure the evangelical voting bloc, former President Donald Trump met with hundreds of evangelical leaders in Times Square, New York, on Tuesday. This demographic is crucial for Trump's presidential aspirations.\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump expressed his commitment to defending religious liberty, including his intention to repeal IRS restrictions that limit political discourse from the pulpit. He stated that a repeal could potentially be his \"biggest contribution to Christianity.\"\n\nAmong the 900 or so evangelical leaders, some who were initially not in favor of Trump seemed to change their stance after the meeting. Matt Barber, founder and editor-in-chief of BarbWire.com, stated, \"The ball has moved forward a little bit. And I appreciate Mr. Trump's willingness to reach out to the evangelical community.\"\n\nTrump contrasted his Supreme Court picks with those that Hillary Clinton might nominate, emphasizing that his choices would be more aligned with the evangelical community's values. Trump also spoke about the need for evangelicals to unite as their rights and values are under attack.\n\nAttendees praised Trump for his lack of major mistakes or missteps during the meeting. Gary Bauer, president of American Values, recalled, \"I can't remember any time during the several hours this morning that his answer disappointed or that there was chagrin about it.\"\n\nMike Huckabee, former Governor of Arkansas, commended Trump for his openness and interaction with the leaders, stating, \"He did something that most Republican nominees in the past have refused to do and that's walk into this room and be willing to sit down, take their questions, and really interact with them in a very big way.\"\n\nWith some evangelicals still expressing reservations, Trump will need to continue outreach efforts. Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, predicted, \"As it pertains to the evangelical vote and the candidacy of Donald J. Trump, today's meeting may very well be a tipping point.\"\n\nRodriguez noted that he knew many pastors who were initially skeptical but changed their views after the meeting. \"After hearing his commitment, his very well-defined, articulated commitment to religious liberty and life, the Supreme Court especially, I think you saw a number of the same pastors walk out going, 'that's what I needed to hear,'\" Rodriguez said.\n\nThe meeting comes after a series of challenging weeks for the Trump campaign. It will be essential for them to capitalize on any progress made by encouraging evangelicals to actively support Trump within their congregations. Trump also announced the formation of an Evangelical Executive Advisory Board.",
    " Title: Ann Romney's Prime-Time Speech at the GOP Convention Emphasizes Struggles and Family Ties\n\nArticle:\n\nAnn Romney, the wife of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, delivered a heartfelt and personal speech during the GOP convention on Tuesday, focusing on their shared struggles, family life, and her own health challenges.\n\nIn her much-anticipated prime-time address, Ann Romney spoke candidly about their \"real marriage,\" rather than a \"storybook marriage,\" and shared her experiences with breast cancer and multiple sclerosis, as well as the trials of raising five children.\n\nBarbara Bair, a delegate from York, Pennsylvania, praised Ann Romney's speech, stating, \"I was so glad she had this opportunity to talk to the women of America, to have them hear about the trials they went through. And to hear that her husband is a man that stands behind her, supporting her through breast cancer. There is nothing scarier for families than cancer.\"\n\nThe speech was intended to humanize Mitt Romney, but it primarily served to humanize Ann Romney, a woman of great attractiveness and expensive polish, and, by extension, her husband. The aim was to help Mitt Romney appeal more to women who may have been wary of the Republican Party's positions on reproductive and workplace rights.\n\nKitty Dunn, a 65-year-old delegate from Utah who has met the Romneys, commented, \"She may have privilege, but she understands.\"\n\nAlthough Ann Romney began her speech with the statement, \"I want to talk to you about love,\" she later shifted to a tougher, more strident defense of her husband, his unheralded good works, and his business success. She defended Bain Capital, the investment firm her husband co-founded, as a company that \"has helped so many others lead better lives.\"\n\nDespite the more assertive tone, Ann Romney's softer, personal approach, including her exclamation of \"I love you women!\" and her connection made talking about her own struggles, was effective.\n\nGreg Treat, a 34-year-old delegate and state senator from Oklahoma, commented, \"I think Ann Romney will make a difference. Michelle Obama is a huge positive for the president, and Mrs. Romney will be for her husband as well.\"",
    " Title: Google Bans Far-Right Websites ZeroHedge and The Federalist from Ad Platform Over Policy Violations\n\nArticle:\n\nGoogle has banned the far-right websites ZeroHedge and The Federalist from its advertising platform due to policy violations related to content about recent Black Lives Matter protests. The company issued a warning to The Federalist on Tuesday over comments on articles related to the protests, but ZeroHedge was banned last week.\n\nGoogle's spokesperson stated in an email that the websites violated its policies on content related to race, promoting derogatory content that promotes hatred, intolerance, violence, or discrimination based on race. The spokesperson added that when a page or site violates its policies, it removes the ability to monetize with Google.\n\nAfter publication of this story, Google clarified on Tuesday that The Federalist had been warned about policy violations but still had time to address them. On Wednesday morning, Google stated that The Federalist had removed the comments that violated its policies, and it would take no further action.\n\nThe Center for Countering Digital Hate, a British nonprofit that combats online hate and misinformation, found that 10 U.S.-based websites, including ZeroHedge and The Federalist, published what they say are racist articles about the protests. The Center for Countering Digital Hate also found advertisements for many companies that had otherwise made public statements supporting Black Lives Matter and the recent protests running on the websites.\n\nImran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said they found content outright racist in defense of white supremacism and containing conspiracy theories about George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement on the websites.\n\nGoogle has banned various websites from its advertising platform in recent years, mostly targeting fake news operations. ZeroHedge and The Federalist have become well known in recent years for publishing far-right articles on a variety of subjects.\n\nAs the Black Lives Matter protests unfolded over recent weeks, hundreds of corporations have lent their support. This includes Google, which said it has donated $12 million in funding to organizations working to address racial inequities.\n\nThere are other similar websites that continue to generate revenue through Google, causing continued concern for civil rights advocates. In its research, the Center for Countering Digital Hate pointed to examples of articles on other far-right websites that carried advertisements by well-known brands while disseminating false narratives about the protest movement.\n\nCaroline McCarthy, vice president of communications and content at TrueX, a digital advertising company, said companies need to hold Google and other digital advertising companies responsible for where their ads run. \"The reality is that they [brands] have to start by asking questions,\" McCarthy said. \"They have to say, what is my brand content going to be running against? And if the other person on the other side of the conversation can\u2019t give them a straight answer, then that\u2019s a problem.\"\n\n\"The pressure on the tech companies is only going to come from dollars actually, literally getting pulled,\" she added.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush's Use of Term \"Anchor Babies\" Sparks Controversy Among Latinos\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent exchange with reporters in New Hampshire, former Governor Jeb Bush used the term \"anchor babies\" to refer to the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants. The term has sparked controversy, with many in the Latino community finding it offensive and inaccurate.\n\nRaul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors, has criticized Bush's use of the term, stating that it is a \"disgusting slur.\" Reyes, who is active on Twitter (@RaulAReyes), emphasizes that the term is dehumanizing to Latinos, immigrants, and children who are as American as anyone else.\n\nThe term \"anchor baby\" is often associated with the belief that having an American-born child can protect undocumented individuals from deportation. The child, in this line of thought, \"anchors\" a family in the United States and allows them to gain citizenship. However, having a citizen child does not provide protection from possible deportation. In the first six months of 2011, parents with U.S.-citizen children accounted for 22% of deportees. Between 2010 and 2012, the United States deported nearly 205,000 parents of citizen kids, and in 2013, over 72,000 were deported, according to The Huffington Post.\n\nAnother misconception surrounding \"anchor babies\" is that people from foreign countries are rushing to the United States to have children. While there has been a phenomenon known as \"birth tourism\" among Asian mothers who temporarily relocate to the United States to have a child, their numbers are statistically small. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 7,955 children were born to foreign residents in 2012. Research has shown that the overwhelming majority of undocumented immigrants come to the United States to work.",
    " Title: Google Fires Employee Over Controversial Memo on Gender Dynamics in Tech Industry\n\nArticle:\n\nGoogle terminated the employment of software engineer James Damore on Monday, following the publication of a 10-page memo he authored that criticized the company's approach to hiring women and suggested biological differences between men and women could contribute to the underrepresentation of women in the tech industry.\n\nDamore's memo, which argued that men, on average, may be biologically more suited to coding jobs than women, sparked a heated debate on social media and within the tech industry. Some found his views offensive and destructive, while others embraced him as a brave truth-teller.\n\nThe incident echoes past examples of the wide gulf between U.S. conservative activists and the tech sector. In 2014, Brendan Eich was forced out as Mozilla's chief executive after his opposition to gay marriage became public. Tech companies often gave benefits to same-sex couples well before gay marriage was legalized.\n\nAndrew Torba, chief executive of the social network Gab, which is popular among conservatives, offered Damore a job, stating that \"censorship is for losers.\" WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange also extended a job offer to Damore, writing on Twitter that \"censorship is for losers.\"\n\nAaron Ginn, co-founder of the Lincoln Network, a group of libertarian-leaning tech workers and investors, criticized Google's decision to fire Damore, stating that the company should have put him through training instead. \"You're going to make him a martyr,\" Ginn said. \"In this hyper-tribal political day we are in, I think you'd want to try to avoid making him a martyr.\"\n\nIntense political feelings have recently divided two board members of Facebook Inc, according to a report by the New York Times. Last August, Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix Inc, warned investor Peter Thiel in an email that Thiel's support for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump showed \"catastrophically bad judgment.\" The outcome of that dispute is not known. Hastings and Thiel remain on Facebook's board.\n\nGoogle, which has used the motto \"Don't be evil,\" received accolades from many quarters for treating Damore's memo as a threat to its corporate culture. However, critics argue that the memo is toxic to the tech community and that it categorizes women as weak or incompetent.\n\nDamore, who could not be reached for comment on Tuesday, said in an email to \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Monday that he was exploring a possible legal challenge to his dismissal. His case would likely be weak, employment lawyers said, and some lawyers said Google could have faced lawsuits if it had not acted against him.\n\nGoogle said it could not discuss individual employee cases. Damore's title at Google was software engineer, and he had worked at the company since December 2013, according to a profile on LinkedIn. The LinkedIn page also states that Damore received a Master's degree in systems biology from Harvard University in 2013, not a PhD, as previously reported.\n\nIndustry experts note that in the early days of tech, it was mostly women who held the then-unglamorous jobs of coding. However, as the value of top-notch programming became clear, men came to dominate the field.\n\nOther tech companies on Tuesday were closely watching the controversy at Google unfold, and grateful they were not the ones caught in another debate over gender and diversity. \"Every large organization has a James Damore - but at tech companies, they're more liberated to share their personal views,\" an executive at one major Silicon Valley firm said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"Tech firms have an abundance of smart, confident people who think they have an obligation to share their wisdom with their coworkers.\"",
    " Title: \"Democratic Loss in North Carolina's 9th District Highlights Shift in Minority Voting Patterns\"\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, the special election in North Carolina's 9th District was touted as the first major contest of the 2020 cycle, with Democrat Dan McCready expected to win a traditionally Republican seat. However, Republican Dan Bishop emerged victorious on Tuesday, with a \"thin margin of victory.\" The focus has since shifted to the voting patterns that may have contributed to Bishop's win, particularly the significant decrease in Democratic votes in counties with a high minority population.\n\nOne of the most concerning examples for the Democrats is rural Robeson County, where the ethnic makeup is 38.6% Native American, 25.7% White, 24% Black, 8.52% Hispanic, 2.15% Two or More Races, 0.66% Asian, and 0.275% Other. In the 2018 election, McCready won Robeson County by 15.31 points. On Tuesday, he received a fraction of the votes, winning by only 1.11 points, a significant decrease from his 2018 performance. In 2012, President Obama carried Robeson County by 17 points.\n\nRobeson County has a population of approximately 143,000, and 74% of these residents are not the \"racist rednecks\" the Democrats might suggest make up most of the Trump/GOP base. The shift away from McCready was due to disenchantment among minority voters with the Democrat.\n\nSimilar trends were observed in other ethnically diverse counties, such as Cumberland County, where nearly 60% of the approximately 333,000 residents are Black, Hispanic, or a member of some other minority group. McCready won Cumberland County in 2018, but Dan Bishop won it on Tuesday.\n\nThe only place where the Democrat improved on his 2018 performance was in the affluent white areas of Mecklenburg County. Bishop only flipped two new counties from blue to red, but he turned several from dark blue to pale blue, reducing McCready's margins in enough ethnically diverse rural counties to win.\n\nThe reasons for this shift in voting patterns are clear. Despite the Democrats' attempts to scare minorities with evidence-free claims that the economy is faltering, a majority of Blacks (53%) and Hispanics (54%) answered that the U.S. economy is \"strong\" in a Harvard-Harris poll released in early September. These are far higher marks than any GOP president has received, particularly from Blacks.\n\nThe unemployment rate among Black Americans hit 5.5% in August, the lowest rate on record. Breitbart points out a secondary effect of this record-low unemployment rate often overlooked by the media: the persistent gap between white and black unemployment also narrowed to its smallest on record. The unemployment ratio has averaged around 2 to 1 or so for decades, meaning the black unemployment rate is typically twice the white unemployment rate. In good times, the unemployment rate of whites and blacks falls, but the gap remains. However, in the current economic climate, the decline in employment inequality is the best on record because it comes in the context of falling unemployment.\n\nPresident Trump acknowledged the positive economic impact of his policies during his North Carolina rally on Monday, explaining that he needs the help of people like Dan Bishop to keep the economy strong and create jobs for all Americans. He also criticized \"the other Dan\" (McCready) for supporting Nancy Pelosi on higher taxes, sanctuary cities, and radical abortion policies.\n\nIn his victory speech, Dan Bishop thanked President Trump and expressed his support for the President's values. He emphasized the need for a congressman with a backbone to represent the 9th District in Washington, D.C. The voters of North Carolina's 9th District agreed, electing Dan Bishop to the House of Representatives. However, it was not racist rednecks or people who wallow in \"white privilege\" who elected Bishop. The voters who elected Bishop are the people who work for a living in places like Cumberland, Richmond, and Robeson counties. They are by no means all white, and they remember all too well what it was like during the Obama years and how it felt to go hat in hand to the unemployment office. This should frighten the Democrats badly.",
    " Title: Special Counsel Adds Charges Against Paul Manafort and Indicts Top Aide\n\nArticle:\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller has added new charges against Paul Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump 2016 campaign, and indicted a top aide, Konstantin Kilimnik. Mr. Manafort is accused of conspiring with Mr. Kilimnik to obstruct justice, in addition to charges of witness tampering, money laundering, illegal foreign lobbying, and lying to federal officials. The new charges, known as a superseding indictment, allege that they sought to tamper with witnesses ahead of Mr. Manafort's trial next month.\n\nThe charges were filed in Washington DC on Friday and came days after Mr. Mueller asked a judge to revoke Mr. Manafort's $10 million bail, which has allowed him to remain under house arrest at his Virginia home, over the witness-tampering accusations. Mr. Kilimnik, a Russian citizen, was a longtime employee of Mr. Manafort's political-consulting firm and had done extensive lobbying work for him in Ukraine on behalf of the country's then pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. He has denied allegations that he has ties to Russian intelligence.\n\nThe legal pressure on Paul Manafort is growing, and now one of his top deputies is joining him in the prosecutorial crosshairs. For the moment, Mr. Manafort is one of the few targets of Mueller's Russia probe to push toward a criminal trial, rather than cooperate with the investigation. The special counsel's team may be hoping the prospect of pre-trial incarceration could help change Mr. Manafort's mind.\n\nPerhaps more important is that an alleged line from the Russian government to the Trump campaign could be getting clearer. Konstintin Kilimnik, a Soviet-born former translator from Ukraine, is reported, by the New York Times and others, to be the \"Person A\" described in a previous Mueller court filing as having \"ties to a Russian intelligence service\" up to and including in 2016, when his boss, Mr. Manafort, worked as the chair of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nMr. Mueller has yet to assert that Mr. Manafort's Ukraine and Russian connections resulted in any election-meddling. The skeleton for future allegations, however, can now be discerned. Mr. Kilimnik appears unlikely to face these new charges in court. His whereabouts are currently unknown, although Mr. Mueller, in a December 2017 court filing, says a Manafort \"colleague\" widely considered to be Kilimnik is \"currently based in Russia.\"\n\nMr. Mueller is investigating whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election. Mr. Mueller was appointed after US President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey last May. On Tuesday, he asked that Mr. Manafort be detained in jail, claiming that he had been using encrypted communication to try to coach two potential witnesses' testimonies. On Friday, Mr. Trump denied that he was considering pardoning Mr. Manafort. \"It's far too early to be thinking about it,\" Mr. Trump told reporters before traveling to the G7 summit in Canada. \"They have not been convicted of anything. There's nothing to pardon.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Face Opportunity to Criticize Obama Administration's Record\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls have been cautious about criticizing former Vice President Joe Biden's eight-year tenure with President Barack Obama, but voters in early primary states see this as an opportunity for candidates brave enough to challenge the Obama orthodoxy. While the Democratic base still holds immense goodwill towards the country's first black president, some early state voters argue that Obama failed to deliver on many of his promises, leaving the political landscape largely unchanged a decade after his historic presidency.\n\n\"We saw what happened with Obama. There's no change yet,\" said Democratic voter Derryl Mitchell II, 27, who owns a media marketing firm in Charleston, South Carolina. \"We had a chance in 2008 and not much came from it. We're still here\u2014same issues.\"\n\nBiden, who is running on a platform of restoring Obama-era values and stability to the country, currently holds a commanding lead in the crowded primary race. He has primarily directed his political attacks at President Trump, while his nearly two dozen rivals have largely refrained from criticizing the former vice president.\n\nThis dynamic is expected to change at the first Democratic presidential primary debate next week in Miami, where Biden will be a primary target. The challenge will be to criticize the Obama administration's record without directly criticizing Obama himself.\n\n\"I actually think there is probably a good bit of room to go after Obama policies without mentioning Obama by name,\" said Brent Nelsen, a political science professor at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. \"There is still an afterglow from the Obama presidency and I would say most candidates aren't going to go out and criticize Barack Obama personally or the administration directly, but you already hear them taking on things like health care.\"\n\nIndeed, liberal activists have argued that Obama's signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act, didn't go far enough and that his administration's record on the deportation of immigrants was abysmal. Biden is also vulnerable to criticism for suddenly championing policies that didn't receive significant push from the Obama White House, such as a $15 minimum wage or free tuition at community colleges.\n\nRepublican strategist and pollster John Couvillon said Biden is vulnerable on the Obama front and will eventually face criticism from his competitors.\n\n\"With President Obama fading further and further into the rearview mirror, those aspects of President Obama's record could be challenged by competitors,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking at a fundraiser in New York on Tuesday, Biden acknowledged the target on his back. \"There's a target on my back,\" he said.\n\nSome White House hopefuls have been cautious about criticism of the Obama legacy. Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke told MSNBC last week that Biden represents a return to the past.\n\n\"You can not go back to the end of the Obama administration and think that that's good enough,\" he said. \"We can not return to the past.\"\n\nHowever, when pressed to explain his comment, Mr. O'Rourke tried to thread the needle, praising Obama as the \"greatest president of my lifetime\" while reiterating his argument that it is time for a new generation of leadership.\n\n\"I think some of the appeal of the vice president's candidacy is a return to an earlier era,\" he said. \"And while we are grateful for that era, and certainly for the service of President Obama, I think we need to be focused on the future, because, even before Donald Trump, we had challenges in this country.\"\n\nThe Democratic hopefuls are understandably skittish about criticizing Obama. Just look at what happened to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose far-left campaign has made him a top 2020 Democratic contender.\n\nLast year, on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Sanders dared to question the accomplishments of Obama.\n\n\"The business model, if you like, of the Democratic Party for the last 15 years or so has been a failure,\" he said at an event in Jackson, Mississippi. \"People sometimes don't see that because there was a charismatic individual named Barack Obama. He was obviously an extraordinary candidate, brilliant guy. But beyond that reality, over the last 10 years, Democrats have lost about 1,000 seats in state legislatures all across this country.\"\n\nThe retribution by Democratic Party faithful was swift and severe. Mr. Sanders was even called \"deplorable.\"\n\nSteffen Schmidt, a political science professor at Iowa State University, said going after the Obama years was too risky. He suggested Biden's rivals focus on what they consider blemishes from the three-plus decades Biden spent representing Delaware in the Senate.\n\n\"Obama went out of two terms with high approval especially among Democrats, so the candidates will need to stick with age, support for tough police action against gangs, his original position on abortion, and other issues Democrats hold against him,\" he said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Biden gets lots of mileage out of his Obama ties. During a campaign swing through Iowa last week, Biden said he was proud to have served as Obama's right-hand man. He touted the role the administration played in passing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in response to the 2008 recession, which he credited with stopping the country from slipping into an economic depression.\n\n\"As a point of personal privilege, I want to say something we don't say often enough to our party and to our nation: Barack Obama was a president of extraordinary character and decency,\" he said in Davenport, eliciting his biggest applause of the evening.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Signals Iran Nuclear Deal Nears Completion, Midterm Elections Could Influence Outcome\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has signaled that a nuclear deal with Iran is close, with negotiations ongoing between the Islamic Republic and the Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, as well as Germany. The negotiations have reportedly been met with apprehension from the U.S. political team regarding the potential reception of the deal in the U.S. Congress and the American public.\n\nThe Obama administration is reportedly working to avoid scrutiny from the Senate, with one senior White House official telling the New York Times that they would not seek congressional legislation in any comprehensive agreement for years. The Democrats controlling the Senate are said to be content to follow the president's lead, with members of the president's own political party reportedly silent and ineffective in challenging the administration's policies on Syria, Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, and responses to ISIS and other terrorist acts.\n\nThe foreign policy and political team is working to finalize the Iran deal in secret, with career State Department foreign service officials reportedly excluded from the real negotiation process. The political appointees working with former Democratic presidential nominee and current Secretary of State John Kerry have allegedly outmaneuvered any dissenting expert voices critical of the deal.\n\nUndersecretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, who was appointed by Hillary Clinton and previously served as the Executive Director of the pro-choice political group Emily's List, has reportedly ignored signs that the Iranians are not serious about making concessions. Sherman, who led unsuccessful negotiations to end North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs in the Clinton administration, has been criticized for being duped by North Korean officials throughout the process.\n\nThe proposed deal from the Obama administration is reportedly weaker than the UN's previous five resolutions demanding Iran stop enriching all uranium. The only chance of stopping the deal, according to the article, is to elect a Republican-controlled Senate willing to fight the president on the issue. Pro-Israel voters, including evangelical Christians and Jewish voters in several states, are urged to vote in the midterm elections to flip the Senate to the Republicans and potentially prevent a disastrous Iran deal. Eastern European Americans concerned about the rise of Russia and the weak American response in Ukraine are also encouraged to vote for the president's opposition in the Senate.\n\nIf Iran obtains the pending Obama deal, the article suggests, a nuclear weapon for the Islamic Republic will likely follow. The midterm elections are presented as the last chance to stop this calamitous outcome. Richard Grenell, a former spokesman for four United States Ambassadors to the United Nations, including Ambassador Zal Khalilzad, is the author of the article.",
    " Title: Republicans Unveil Final Tax Bill, Aim for Vote Next Week\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublicans have unveiled their final tax bill on Friday, moving closer to a vote in the following week and potentially signing it into law by the end of the year. The bill, which has been a campaign promise, is expected to lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax, nearly double the standard deduction for individuals, and restructure the way pass-through businesses are taxed.\n\nThe bill keeps seven personal income tax brackets and lowers the tax rates for most brackets, including dropping the top rate to 37% from 39.6%. The child tax credit under the bill will be $2,000, and the credit is refundable up to $1,400.\n\nThe conference report allows individuals to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local taxes. Individuals can either elect to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local income and property taxes or state and local property and sales taxes. The student loan interest deduction remains untouched, and the mortgage interest deduction cap has been lowered.\n\nUnlike previous versions of the bill, the conference committee version leaves the estate tax untouched, doubling the estate tax exemption instead. The bill also repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax and makes changes to the individual alternative minimum tax.\n\nRepublican leaders are confident they have enough support to pass their legislation next week. The bill appears to be gathering momentum, as key holdouts in the Senate, where Republicans have a slim two-vote majority, have signaled their support for the bill.\n\nOne of the key items Republicans have had to keep a close eye on is how much their bill costs. Under the Senate rules, the bill can not cost more than $1.5 trillion over 10 years and it can not add to the deficit after that. The bill sunsets the individual tax breaks at the end of 2025 and repeals the individual mandate to help finance the bill.\n\nThis story will continue to update with additional developments.",
    " Title: Key Tax Reform Issues Remain Unresolved as Republicans Strive for Permanent, Revenue-Neutral Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration and congressional Republicans are working towards unifying around a single tax-reform bill, aiming to pass the legislation this year. However, there are still key differences between the priorities of the White House, the House, and the Senate that need to be resolved.\n\nFive tax reform issues that Republicans need to address include the permanence of the changes, the budget window, tax rates for individuals and businesses, the border-adjustment tax (BAT), and business investment language.\n\nHouse GOP leaders are pushing for the changes to be permanent, but some senators and administration officials have expressed openness to temporary tax changes. If Republicans want to pass a tax-reform bill under \"reconciliation\" to bypass a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, the legislation must be revenue-neutral or make the tax cuts temporary.\n\nRepublicans agree on lowering tax rates, but there is a disagreement on how low to set tax rates for both individuals and businesses. The Trump administration's tax plan proposes individual tax brackets of 35 percent, 25 percent, and 10 percent, as well as a 15 percent rate for corporations and small businesses. Meanwhile, the House Republicans' blueprint would establish individual tax rates of 33 percent, 25 percent, and 12 percent, with a corporate tax rate of 20 percent and a maximum rate of 25 percent for pass-through businesses.\n\nThe biggest fight over tax reform so far this year has centered on the House GOP's BAT proposal. Under the proposal, imports would be subject to a 20 percent tax that wouldn't apply to exports. However, the proposal's fate doesn't look promising, as GOP senators, administration officials, and even some House Republicans have expressed concerns about its impact on consumers.\n\nWithout the BAT, lawmakers will have to find other ways to raise revenue and prevent corporations from shifting profits overseas. The GOP tax plan's language about business investment may be its next most hotly debated provision. The plan would eliminate the deduction for businesses' net interest expenses, instead allowing companies to immediately write off the full costs of their investments.\n\nHouse GOP leaders believe that \"full expensing\" is a policy that would provide more of an incentive for businesses to invest. However, the interest deduction has its defenders, who say that debt financing is important to industries such as real estate, private equity, telecommunications, and agriculture.\n\nThe tax plans from House Republicans and the White House do not include infrastructure. However, linking taxes and transportation may not be off the table, as Trump and some lawmakers have floated the idea. After the BAT, the GOP tax plan's language about business investment may be its next most hotly debated provision.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders Sues Democratic National Committee Over Voter File Access Suspension\n\nArticle:\n\nPresidential candidate Bernie Sanders filed a lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Friday, seeking access to the party's voter files following the suspension of his campaign's access due to alleged unauthorized access to Hillary Clinton's campaign files. The incident has become a source of controversy for both Sanders and the DNC.\n\nThe DNC accused Sanders' campaign of playing dirty, while Sanders claimed the DNC is attempting to undermine his campaign to benefit Clinton. Clinton, in turn, has remained silent on the matter, with her campaign manager, Robby Mook, stating that Sanders' staff \"stole data from our campaign.\"\n\nThe DNC's voter data file, which contains detailed demographic, voting history, and personal information of tens of millions of Americans, was suspended from Sanders' access after the DNC detected over two dozen breaches where Sanders employees accessed Clinton data and attempted to download it.\n\nSanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, stated that one staffer has been terminated, and others are being questioned for acting \"irresponsibly.\" However, the campaign also argues that the DNC had no legal right to suspend their access, and claims Democratic Party leaders are trying to aid Clinton's campaign.\n\nDNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, speaking on CNN, defended the decision to suspend Sanders' access, stating it was a fair move because he broke the terms of the access agreement. The third Democratic presidential debate is scheduled for the following day, with Sanders, Clinton, and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley participating.\n\nClinton currently maintains a wide lead in national polls and is ahead in Iowa, but Sanders leads in New Hampshire. Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, expressed surprise that Sanders was fundraising off the incident, stating, \"Their staff stole data from our campaign, and they are now fundraising off of it. I'll leave it to voters what that says or doesn't say.\"\n\nMook called for an independent monitor to ensure the data has been expunged by the Sanders campaign. The incident marks the latest in a series of computer-related problems that have plagued the Democrats this year. In a separate incident, Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State has been a point of controversy.\n\nClinton's spokesman, Brian Fallon, stated that the Sanders breach of voter files was not an accident, and Sanders staffers not only looked at the data but at one point tried\u2014apparently unsuccessfully\u2014to download data into a spreadsheet for storage and use later. Sanders is paying $10,000 a month for access to the files, but in his court documents, he stated that losing access to the files and his campaign's work on them is costing his operation over $600,000 a day in value because he cannot access mailing lists he has used to raise money.",
    " Title: White House Signs Bipartisan TRACED Act to Combat Unwanted Robocalls\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House announced on Monday that President Trump had signed the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act, a bipartisan legislation aimed at preventing criminal robocalls. The new law will provide American consumers with increased protection against unwanted robocalls.\n\nThe TRACED Act updates existing laws and regulations to strengthen penalties, increase transparency, and enhance government collaboration to stop unwanted solicitation. President Donald J. Trump expressed pride in working with Congress to get this legislation to his desk and signing it into law.\n\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, a robocall attempting to sell a product or service is illegal unless a company has the consumer's written permission. The TRACED Act takes several significant steps in the fight against illegal robocalls, including requiring phone carriers to authenticate the legitimacy of calls and blocking unverified robocalls at no cost to consumers.\n\nThe bill is a bipartisan effort, with near-unanimous support in Congress. It is a significant win for consumers across the country, officially putting illegal robocallers on notice. While no process is perfect, the TRACED Act represents an important legislative compromise that will begin to address the issue of illegal robocalls.\n\nSenator Thune, who partnered with the President on this consumer protection issue, expressed gratitude for the Senate's action. He hopes the President will quickly sign the bill into law, allowing families to enjoy a new year of family calls instead of robocalls.",
    " Title: Biden, Buttigieg Warn of Difficulties in Winning Elections with Democratic Socialist Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Presidential contender Pete Buttigieg have expressed concerns about the potential impact of a Democratic socialist nominee on the party and the country.\n\nIn an interview on ABC News' \"This Week,\" Biden stated that nominating a progressive candidate, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), for president would make it harder for Democrats to win elections across the board. Biden suggested that voters in Mid-Western and Southern states would not be as willing to vote for Democratic candidates if the presidential nominee supports democratic socialistic policies.\n\nHowever, Biden vowed to \"work like hell\" to help Sanders win the election if he won the nomination. He also warned that President Donald Trump is desperate to pin the democratic socialist label on all Democratic candidates to use as a foil, and nominating Sanders would help him do that.\n\nSimilarly, Buttigieg expressed concern about the potential impact of a democratic socialist nominee, not just on the Democratic Party, but on the country as a whole. He stated that a democratic socialist label could further divide the country and that most people do not see themselves fitting into the \"revolution or status quo\" picture presented by some campaigns.\n\nThe concerns expressed by Biden and Buttigieg come after a disappointing fourth-place finish by Sanders in the Iowa Caucus last week. Sanders has consistently identified as a democratic socialist and has been a leading voice in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.",
    " Title: Dan Coats Steps Down as US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe Nominated as Successor\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, has announced his resignation, making him the latest high-profile figure to leave the Trump administration. President Donald Trump tweeted that Coats would step down in mid-August, with Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe set to replace him.\n\nCoats and Trump have often been at odds, particularly on issues related to Russia, North Korea, and the Iran nuclear deal. As Director of National Intelligence, Coats oversaw all 17 US intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA. However, throughout his tenure, Coats' assessments were frequently contradicted by the president, who has been critical of intelligence agencies.\n\nIn January, the president called his intelligence chiefs \"passive and naive\" in their assessment of the threat posed by Iran. Coats is the latest in a string of Trump administration officials to leave the White House, including former Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.\n\nIn his resignation letter to the president, Coats said America's intelligence community had become \"stronger than ever\" during his two-and-a-half-year tenure. \"As a result, I now believe it is time for me to move on to the next chapter of my life,\" he wrote.\n\nCoats and Trump's differences on foreign policy appeared irreconcilable at times, particularly on Russian interference in US elections, the Iran nuclear deal, and Trump's attempts at rapprochement with North Korea. Citing a former senior intelligence official, the Washington Post reported that Coats came to see his departure as inevitable given his troubled relationship with Trump.\n\nLast year, the intelligence chief admitted that Trump did not brief him about his behind-closed-doors meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. \"If he had asked me how that ought to be conducted, I would have suggested a different way,\" Coats said of their summit.\n\nCoats' views also diverged from the president's on North Korea. In January, Coats told Congress North Korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons, contradicting a statement by Trump that Pyongyang no longer posed a threat.\n\nDan Coats has served as Director of National Intelligence since March 2017, succeeding James Clapper. Born in Jackson, Michigan, Coats graduated from two universities with degrees in political science and law in the 1960s. He served two terms as a Republican senator for Indiana, from 1989 to 1999 and again from 2011 to 2017. Coats also served as the US ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005 in between his terms in the Senate.\n\nA prominent supporter of the president and his policies, John Ratcliffe has served as the congressman for Texas' 4th District since 2015. Providing his nomination is approved, Ratcliffe's views are expected to chime with Trump's more often in his new role. Last Wednesday, Ratcliffe defended the president during the testimony of former special counsel Robert Mueller, who led a two-year investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer criticized Ratcliffe's appointment, stating, \"it's clear that Rep Ratcliffe was selected because he exhibited blind loyalty to President Trump with his demagogic questioning of... Mueller.\"",
    " Title: Indictment of Former Trump Campaign Officials: A Look at the Current Case and Historical Precedents\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent guilty plea by former Trump campaign officials, specifically Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, has raised questions about their involvement in the 2016 presidential campaign and potential ties to Russia. The fact that Gates pleaded guilty to only two relatively lower-level charges suggests that he may have valuable information for Special Counsel Robert Mueller, according to legal experts.\n\nManafort's participation in a June 2016 meeting with Donald Trump Jr., the candidate's son, and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, with a Russian lawyer under the promise of receiving incriminating information about Hillary Clinton on behalf of Russia's government, has been a point of interest. Additionally, Manafort reportedly offered to give \"private briefings\" to Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch allied with President Vladimir V. Putin, whom Manafort allegedly owed $19 million. Prosecutors are interested in learning about the watering down of a Republican convention platform plank on Russia's intervention in Ukraine.\n\nGates' credibility as a witness may be questioned due to his guilty plea to lying to the FBI during his plea negotiations. However, Ty Cobb, the White House special counsel, has stated that Manafort has no damaging information against President Trump. Manafort reiterated his innocence and his intention to fight the \"untrue piled up charges\" on Friday.\n\nPresident Trump's argument that the ongoing investigations have no connection to him resonates with many of his supporters. However, historical precedents suggest that being surrounded by prosecuted individuals can cause political damage, even if the president is not directly implicated. For instance, President Jimmy Carter faced significant political damage when his confidant and budget director, Bert Lance, was accused of banking irregularities. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton also faced investigations of their aides unrelated to them.\n\nIn the current case, the targets include not just a \"coffee boy,\" as Manafort's former campaign adviser described George Papadopoulos, but the president's top two campaign officials and national security adviser. While Trump has dismissed the relevance of allegations against Manafort due to their involvement in business dealings before the campaign, the latest indictment claims that Manafort was scheming to defraud banks while serving as Trump's campaign chairman.",
    " Title: Questions Remain Over British Ex-Spy's Unverified Anti-Trump Dossier and FBI's Handling of It\n\nArticle:\n\nThursday's testimony by James Comey focused on his discussions with President Trump, but the former FBI director still faces questions regarding the links between the bureau and a British ex-spy's mysterious and unverified anti-Trump dossier. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., asked Comey about the dossier, prepared by former British spy Christopher Steele, during Thursday's morning testimony. However, Comey declined to discuss the issue in open session, citing the sensitivity of the material in the report.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, has yet to receive a response from Comey in the matter of Steele and his London-based company, Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd. Steele's firm was hired by Fusion GPS, a Washington, D.C. firm, to collect opposition research on then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign.\n\nFor months, Grassley has criticized Comey for the bureau's failure to provide documents requested and answer questions about Steele. Grassley also called out Fusion GPS this week for allegedly not cooperating with his committee, sending a June 7 letter seeking \"all responsive documents and information\" by June 14 and warning that he could consider a \"compulsory process\" if necessary.\n\nComey considered the unverified dossier prepared by Steele to be so important that he insisted it be included in January's final intelligence community report on Russian meddling in the election. The FBI offered Steele $50,000 to corroborate the dossier, according to published reports, though the bureau has denied making any payments.\n\nThe Steele dossier was part of the evidence the FBI used to obtain a FISA warrant for Carter Page, a peripheral adviser in the Trump campaign the dossier named as a figure in Trump campaign dealings with Russia. In interviews with Fox News, Page repeatedly denied he was the Trump campaign's point person for Moscow, and said he believes he was a target of unmasking efforts by the Obama administration.\n\nQuestions remain over how the unverified dossier was passed around on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly between June and December 2016, as it was shown in parts to a variety of politicians, journalists, and intelligence agencies before being brought officially to the FBI by Sen. John McCain on Dec. 9.\n\nThe person who brought the dossier to the attention of McCain last fall, former British Ambassador Sir Andrew Wood, now emphasizes to Fox News that \"Intelligence always needs evaluating of course...It is always foolish to put yourself in a position to pretend to knowledge that you do not have.\"\n\nIn an email exchange, Wood said while he told McCain about the material, he \"had not read and could not vouch for\" it. Still, he said, the material was \"produced by responsible persons.\"\n\n\"I understood that its general contents were known to others in the United States. The Senator then arranged for the papers to be brought to him,\" he wrote, adding: \"It was up to the Senator to decide what action if any he took throughout the whole process. He is known to me as to many others as a courageous patriot. I have no doubt that he acted as he thought fit in that capacity.\"\n\nServing as Britain's ambassador to Moscow from 1995-2000, Wood's name and his relationship with Steele emerged in British Court documents obtained and reviewed by Fox News as part of Steele's defense in a lawsuit brought against him by Russian technology guru Aleksej Gubarev. Gubarev\u2014whose companies are mentioned in the dossier\u2014has also filed a lawsuit in Fort Lauderdale, Florida against Buzzfeed for publishing the unverified 35-page dossier in full.\n\nThe April 2017 documents identify Wood as \"an Associate of Orbis\" and say he was \"aware of the Second Defendant's\" [Steele's] intelligence gathering for the pre-election memoranda. However, in email exchanges with Fox News on June 6, Wood told a different story.\n\n\"I have had no professional relationship with Orbis,\" he wrote. \"You refer to me as an \u2018Associate\u2019 (capital A) and draw some conclusions as to my role, which go beyond what it has been, that of a friend to Christopher Steele and a person among others with whom I have from time to time discussed Russian affairs.\"\n\nWhen asked about the role of Fusion GPS in Washington D.C., Wood wrote that \"I do not know Fusion apart from the fact that it exists.\"\n\nMcCain's office has not responded to Fox News' latest request for comment on the dossier. In a Jan. 11 press release, McCain stated, \"Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI.\"",
    " Title: Clinton Faces Tight Race Despite Advantages in White House Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, is facing a tight race against Republican opponent Donald Trump, despite several advantages in the race for the White House. Clinton has a larger staff, a favorable Electoral College map, and demographic trends moving in her favor. She is running to succeed a popular president and the economy is strengthening. However, Trump has divided the Republican Party and alienated large groups of Americans.\n\nAs of August 27, Clinton had a more than 6-point lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics national average of polls. However, by Tuesday, her lead had narrowed to 2.4 percentage points. Polls have shown Trump ahead in the swing states of Florida and Ohio, and he has a fighting chance in all other battleground states, including purple states such as Nevada and Virginia, as well as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states a Republican hasn't won in decades.\n\nClinton's team believes her strong performance in Monday's debate will translate into a wider lead going into the second and third contests next month. \"The debate buoys her to the next big thing and the next debate,\" said one Clinton surrogate. They also argue that it is Trump who faces some pressure, with the next presidential debate on Oct. 9 in St. Louis potentially being a must-win situation for the Republican.\n\nHowever, Clinton and her supporters acknowledge they are in a close race that could still go either way. \"I'm afraid that since Trump is backed into a corner, he'll come out swinging for the gutter,\" said Democratic strategist and Clinton surrogate Jim Manley. \"There's still a long way to go between now and the election in November. There's still lots of ups and downs and many twists to go.\"\n\nIf Clinton loses, the gains her party made in the Obama years could be turned back, from the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reform to regulatory actions on climate change and immigration. Clinton would also go down as the Democrat who lost to Trump, a status she clearly does not want.\n\nClinton's campaign has been sidelined at times by storylines like the controversy over her use of a private email server at the State Department, which overshadowed her campaign and fed into the narrative that Clinton is dishonest and secretive. \"I think a lot of people have wondered why we don't have a commanding lead in the final stretch, and I think she's going to have to spend some time sealing the deal for a lot of folks,\" said a surrogate.\n\nIf Clinton is feeling the pressure, it is not evident. On Tuesday, she said she was up for the challenge. \"You should know by now, when I set my mind on something, I keep going,\" she told reporters on her plane just weeks after a bout of pneumonia forced her off the campaign trail briefly. \"I don't quit, whatever the static, whatever the incoming is, and that's what I'll do for the American people.\"\n\nHowever, Clinton has wondered why she doesn't have a bigger lead against Trump with less than 40 days to go until Election Day. Last week, during a videoconference with the Laborers International Union of North America, she vocalized it: \"Why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask?\" The comment was an acknowledgement of a question her supporters ask\u2014and of their frustration. Earlier this week, the Trump campaign put out an ad criticizing Clinton for the remark and accusing her of becoming \"more and more frustrated with how out of touch she is\" with voters.\n\nClinton allies say they hoped their candidate's performance on Monday night stopped Trump's momentum so they can begin building a lead again. \"I think her base may be stronger than ever, and motivated,\" one longtime Clinton adviser said. But, at the same time, the adviser cautioned that \"there should be no resting on laurels.\"",
    " Title: Facebook's Claimed Competition: A Closer Look at the Top Social Apps\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent testimony before Congress, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that the company faces competition from at least eight major apps. However, it is worth noting that Facebook owns or has a version of each of these apps that supposedly threaten them.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, Zuckerberg's defense against accusations of Facebook having a monopoly has been to claim that the average American internet user regularly uses eight other social apps, not just Facebook's platform. However, data from mobile app insight service App Annie suggests a different picture.\n\nIn the United States, Zuckerberg's company owns three of the top 10 apps. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, is number four, Facebook Messenger is number 6, and the Facebook app itself is number 8. The top three apps are games, but for all other apps, Facebook has or is working on a cloned version or features of those apps.\n\nFor instance, the YouTube app sits at number 5, and Facebook is currently attempting to build its \"Watch Video\" section to take on YouTube. The Silicon Valley giant has already adopted the \"Stories\" idea from the seventh most popular app, Snapchat. Facebook also owns the 19th most popular app, WhatsApp.\n\nIf one selects the \"Social Media\" category on App Annie and sorts by the \"most popular\" apps, Facebook owns the top three apps listed. This contradicts Zuckerberg's statement that users have a variety of choices when it comes to social media networks outside of Facebook.\n\nIn summary, while Zuckerberg claims that users regularly use eight different communication and social apps, Facebook's ownership or cloning of several top apps in the United States suggests a different reality. This raises questions about the level of competition in the social media market and the extent to which Facebook dominates this space.",
    " Title: Trump Faces Calls for Staff Changes Amidst Ongoing White House Turmoil\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is facing calls for staff changes following the controversial firing of FBI Director James Comey. Former aides, GOP strategists, and sources close to the White House have expressed concern over President Trump's handling of the situation, which they believe has undermined his staff.\n\nChanges seemed imminent late last week, as the president expressed anger over the rollout of Comey's firing. However, with Trump set to begin his first foreign trip as president on Friday, many think the threat of staff changes has temporarily subsided.\n\nThe repeated rumors of a shakeup have damaged morale, with aides acknowledging that the turmoil surrounding Comey's firing is the worst to hit the White House yet. Allies close to the administration want to see Trump act decisively or move on, rather than keep his staff in limbo under threat of change.\n\nThe rumors have touched nearly every corner of the West Wing, including senior advisers such as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and strategist Stephen Bannon. The most intense speculation in recent days has centered on the press operation and embattled press secretary Sean Spicer.\n\nTrump's communications team was kept in the dark ahead of firing Comey, leading to a chaotic rollout that produced conflicting stories about the reasoning behind the decision. The turmoil led Trump to publicly question the performance of his media relations staff.\n\nWhile Trump praised Spicer as a \"nice man,\" he declined to definitively say if he would keep his current post. \"He's doing a good job, but he gets beat up,\" Trump said. Pressed on whether he'd keep Spicer at the lectern, Trump said, \"He's been there at the beginning.\"\n\nA subdued Spicer returned to the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room on Monday, where he faced another barrage of questions over Trump's decision to fire Comey. White House spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nThose who have worked for Trump say it is common knowledge that, with the exception of family, staff members live on thin ice. Confusion over the division of responsibilities on the team of rivals Trump has assembled has created a White House where leaks have become the norm.\n\nTrump's allies say he is frustrated by the leaks, which they say are coming from advisers who either don't believe in Trump's message, refuse to buy into the way he does business, or are so obsessed by the Washington power game that they'd risk harming the administration to boost their own image.\n\nA sweeping reshuffle would bring its own set of difficulties. Trump's thirst for personal loyalty could narrow the universe of Republicans he might consider hiring, given that many top GOP aides were deeply critical of him during the 2016 campaign. It's a problem the White House has encountered as it struggles to fill posts across the federal government.\n\nAt the same time, the ally stressed that whoever is brought in would have to have enough gravitas to carry out major changes, saying, \"He's going to have to bring in a real, real political pro to fix this thing.\"\n\nOthers say Trump has brought these problems upon himself by shutting out many of his top aides and advisers or contradicting them in public. \"The problem is not Spicer or [White House communications director Michael] Dubke if you tell them 45 minutes in advance that you're firing Jim Comey,\" said one former adviser. \"If you lack confidence in your communications team, go find people you have confidence in.\"\n\nRepublican strategist John Feehery, who is also a columnist for \u2588\u2588\u2588, made a similar point. \"The White House is actually doing pretty well when the president doesn't screw up,\" he said. \"They needed to have a better system of controlling his anger.\"\n\nIn past administrations, the chief of staff has taken on the role of gatekeeper to the president, controlling who meets with him and what information he receives. In Trump's White House, rival factions exist in competition for Trump's ear.\n\nFormer Trump aides and GOP operatives with close ties to the White House say Trump has not given Priebus enough responsibility. \"The leaks shows a total lack of discipline, and that starts with the chief of staff,\" said a former Trump adviser. \"The only way to be effective here is for the chief of staff to grab the loudest, most inveterate opponents inside the White House and to fire them. If the president hasn't empowered him to do that, then he needs to walk.\"\n\nInsiders who spoke to \u2588\u2588\u2588 believe that, despite recent reports, Bannon is probably safe. He represents Trump's core economic nationalist vision, and it is believed that Trump's base would flee if the president narrowed his inner circle to Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and economic adviser Gary Cohn, who are viewed as liberals by many grassroots conservatives.\n\n\"There would be tremendous base flight if Bannon were gone,\" said one former adviser. Bannon's allies believe Kushner is pushing his father-in-law to clean house.\n\nPolitical watchers say the appearance of chaos and the backdrop of uncertainty has undercut Trump's credibility on the global stage as he prepares to make his first overseas trip, which includes stops in Saudi Arabia and Israel as well as summit meetings with major U.S. allies.\n\n\"Trump's credibility abroad is taking severe hits,\" said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, in a dispatch to clients. \"On the back of Emmanuel Macron's win in France, continental European leaders together view Trump as a dangerous buffoon, one to be increasingly strategized against, rather than with.\"",
    " Title: The Legitimacy of Not Voting: Debunking Common Myths Surrounding Abstention\n\nArticle:\n\nThe act of not voting has long been a contentious topic, often met with disapproval and a sense of civic duty. However, it is essential to examine the underlying assumptions and myths that surround this choice. Here are four common myths about not voting, debunked.\n\n1. A single vote can significantly impact election outcomes:\nA comprehensive review by economists Casey Mulligan and Charles Hunter found that only one federal election in more than a century has been decided by a single vote. In reality, a voter's individual impact on an election is minimal.\n\n2. Not voting disenfranchises underrepresented groups:\nWhile it is true that only about half of the voting-age population participates in elections, the act of voting does not equate to being a good citizen. Social and cultural change often occur outside the political sphere, and individuals can contribute to the American experiment in various ways, such as tweeting, blogging, donating, or activating.\n\n3. Not voting is unpatriotic:\nThe right to vote, as well as the right to abstain, has been fought for by generations of brave Americans. In fact, choosing not to vote can be an expression of love for one's country, as it allows individuals to focus their time and resources on more impactful activities.\n\n4. Lack of knowledge disqualifies one from not voting:\nEven well-informed voters cannot predict a candidate's actions in office, and the two-party system may not represent the interests of some individuals. In such cases, abstaining from voting can be a principled choice.\n\nUltimately, the decision to vote or not to vote is a personal one, and individuals should feel empowered to make choices that align with their values and beliefs. Whether one chooses to vote or not, it is crucial to engage in informed, thoughtful discourse and to recognize the legitimacy of all perspectives.",
    " Title: President Obama Apologizes for Health Insurance Plan Losses, Senate Introduces Bill to Delay Individual Mandate of Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama expressed his apologies on Thursday for Americans losing health insurance plans they were assured they could keep, as a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate to delay the individual mandate of Obamacare by one year. The proposed legislation aims to avoid a $95 penalty for not having health insurance, which is set to take effect next year.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News, Obama stated, \"I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. We've got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this.\"\n\nThe White House, while defending the health care law and vowing to address the website issues, has not explicitly ruled out the possibility of delaying the individual mandate. House Speaker John Boehner responded to Obama's apology, stating, \"An apology is certainly in order, but what Americans want to hear is that the president is going to keep his promise.\"\n\nThe bill, introduced by Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), aims to delay the individual mandate to provide Americans more time to explore their health insurance options. The legislation also acknowledges the positive components of the Affordable Care Act but recognizes the need for \"commonsense reforms\" to address the issues with the federal healthcare exchanges.\n\nSenator Manchin stated, \"We need to start working together to fix this law and make it work so that all Americans have access to affordable and reliable health care coverage.\" The bill suggests a one-year delay of the individual mandate to eliminate penalty fees if individuals choose not to enroll for a health care plan in 2014.\n\nThe bill also notes that delaying the entire implementation of Obamacare would not be \"responsible,\" but Congress should take action to make \"commonsense reforms\" to the law. Senator Kirk added, \"Healthcare should not be a burden on consumers, which is why we must delay the penalty for individuals.\"\n\nThe legislation emphasizes the need to maintain the positive aspects of the Affordable Care Act while addressing the issues with the federal healthcare exchanges. The bill concludes by stating, \"Healthcare should not be a burden on consumers, which is why we must delay the penalty for individuals.\"",
    " Title: India Implements World's Largest Lockdown to Combat COVID-19 Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nIndia will institute the world's largest lockdown starting Wednesday, as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a televised address. The 21-day lockdown aims to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, with Modi warning citizens to stay indoors or risk inviting the pandemic into their homes. The move affects nearly one-fifth of the world's population.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Indian health officials have reported 469 active cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and 10 deaths. The government has invoked a British Raj-era epidemic act, granting it sweeping powers to manage the disease. The cases have been growing rapidly, with Modi stating they have the potential to \"spread like wildfire.\"\n\nIn recent days, India has been gradually implementing stay-at-home orders and has banned international and domestic flights, as well as passenger service on its extensive rail system. Essential service providers, including hospitals, police, and media, had been exempted from the stay-in-place orders, with many grocery stores and pharmacies remaining open.\n\nModi referred to the lockdown as a \"total lockdown\" but did not specify whether any service providers would be exempt. He stated that \"all steps have been taken by central and state government to ensure supply of essential items.\" However, it remains unclear how this will affect the approximately 300 million Indians who, according to official data, live below the poverty line.\n\nIndian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that a comprehensive relief package would be unveiled soon. Indian virologist Dr. T. Jacob John stated before the lockdown was announced that India was being forced to take extreme containment measures after failing to mitigate the problem earlier, when the caseload was light.\n\n\"There would have been time because the wolf was not yet at the door. Now today the wolf's inside the door and India's supposed to calmly respond with a wolf in the corner,\" he said.",
    " Title: Pompeo's Secret Meeting with Kim Jong Un Highlights Administration's Foreign Policy Fractures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Washington D.C., the revelation of a clandestine meeting between Mike Pompeo, the outgoing Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.) director, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the end of last month has stirred discussions about the Trump administration's foreign policy strategies. The unusual choice of a C.I.A. director, with little diplomatic experience, to lead the U.S. delegation for such a high-stakes meeting has exposed critical fractures within an administration that has reportedly sidelined the State Department's diplomatic corps.\n\nThe meeting, which took place under unusual circumstances, has boosted Pompeo, who is currently awaiting Senate confirmation to take over the State Department from the unceremoniously dismissed Rex Tillerson. However, among veteran foreign-policy hands, the C.I.A. director's advance-man trip has highlighted the administration's reliance on non-traditional channels for diplomacy.\n\nAccording to a senior administration official, Tillerson was dismissed just days after President Donald Trump agreed to meet with Kim, leaving Pompeo, nominated by Trump to be Tillerson's successor, to take the lead on the administration's negotiations with Pyongyang. The meeting was facilitated through a back channel between the C.I.A. and its North Korean intelligence counterpart, the Reconnaissance General Bureau.\n\nDuring his visit to North Korea over Easter, Pompeo was reportedly accompanied by a small group of C.I.A. officials, but no one from the White House or the State Department. The decision to send Pompeo to meet with Kim was less about his role as spy chief than his close personal relationship with the former Tea Party lawmaker, according to an administration official.\n\nThe larger question hanging over the upcoming North Korea summit, tentatively planned for late May or early June, is whether Pompeo continues to take point as he navigates the administration's foreign policy decisions alongside Trump's equally ambitious national security adviser, John Bolton, a notorious war hawk who has advocated for a pre-emptive military strike.\n\nSuzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation who has engaged North Korean officials in unofficial discussions, expressed concerns about Bolton's outlook on North Korea and his potential impact on the diplomatic process. \"I think [given] Bolton's outlook on North Korea, which is well-known because he has written about it extensively, it wouldn't be surprising if his lack of enthusiasm about a diplomatic solution to the North Korea problem doesn't get in the way of this process going forward,\" DiMaggio said. \"It does beg to question whether he's the right person to be the president's national security adviser at this time.\"\n\nThe circumstances of the Pompeo-Kim meeting were primarily a function of timing. The lack of a permanent secretary of state and the administration's reliance on non-traditional channels for diplomacy have raised questions about the Trump administration's foreign policy strategies. The larger question, however, remains whether these strategies will lead to a successful resolution of the North Korea issue.",
    " Title: Twitter Censors President Trump's Tweet Regarding Minneapolis Riots, Citing Violence Glorification\n\nArticle:\n\nTwitter has censored a tweet from President Donald Trump on Thursday night, in which the president expressed anger at rioters in Minneapolis who were \"dishonoring the memory of George Floyd\" and warned that \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Twitter stated that the president's remarks were \"glorifying violence\" based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today.\n\nIn the tweet, Trump wrote, \"I can\u2019t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right.\" He continued, \"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won\u2019t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\"\n\nWhen the tweet is embedded in a post, it does not show the censorship label that Twitter applied. However, a screenshot of the tweet on Twitter's platform shows the censorship label that Twitter applied.\n\nIn a statement, Twitter Comms said, \"This Tweet violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today.\" Twitter added, \"We\u2019ve taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts, but have kept the Tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the Tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance.\" Twitter noted that engagements with the Tweet will be limited, and people will be able to Retweet with Comment but will not be able to Like, Reply, or Retweet it.\n\nTwitter's actions against the president come after Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that took action against social media companies for repeatedly discriminating against and censoring conservatives. The executive order was issued after Twitter started applying controversial labels to Trump's tweets while largely ignoring false statements from Democrats and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nTwitter took no action against numerous tweets that appeared to encourage rioting, destruction of property, or fighting against law enforcement. The following controversial tweets, which Twitter did not take any action against, are from public figures or they are tweets that went viral on the platform and garnered tens of thousands of retweets:\n\n* Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has ties to Black Lives Matter and his company \"painted # blacklivesmatter on a wall at its San Francisco headquarters, placing the company squarely into the national debate about excessive force used by police with blacks,\" USA Today reported in 2014.\n* In 2018, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey promoted an article on his Twitter account and said it was \"great.\" The article essentially called for turning the entire United States into California and completely eliminating the Republican Party.\n* The Daily Caller reported that the article, titled \"The Great Lesson of California in America's New Civil War,\" called for a complete marginalization of the Republican Party and its voters since they only care \"about rule by and for billionaires at the expense of working people\" and not \"average citizens.\" California, despite its mass wealth inequality, growing lack of social cohesion, poverty, and soaring housing costs, \"provides a model for America as a whole,\" according to the authors.

    " Title: North Korea Announces Disarmament Ceremony at Nuclear Test Site Ahead of U.S.-DPRK Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has announced plans to dismantle its nuclear testing site, located in the northeastern part of the country, from May 23-25. The dismantlement ceremony is part of the Hermit Kingdom's pledge to discontinue nuclear tests.\n\nAccording to North Korea's Foreign Ministry, all tunnels at the Punggye-ri testing ground will be destroyed by explosion, and observation and research facilities, as well as ground-based testing units, will be removed. The announcement, made on Saturday, stated that the Nuclear Weapon Institute and other concerned institutions are taking technical measures for dismantling the northern nuclear test ground of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).\n\nThe North has also invited journalists from the United States, South Korea, China, Russia, and Britain to inspect the dismantling process. Analysts suggest that the closure of the site is mostly symbolic and does not represent a material step toward denuclearization.\n\nThe announcement follows U.S. President Donald Trump's plans for a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12, marking the first meeting ever between a sitting U.S. president and the leader of North Korea. Kim had previously revealed plans to shut down the nuclear test site during his summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month.\n\nFollowing the Moon-Kim summit, Moon's office stated that Kim was willing to disclose the process to international experts, but the North's statement on Saturday did not include any mention about allowing experts on the site.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on Friday, stated that North Korea can look forward to \"a future brimming with peace and prosperity\" if it agrees to quickly give up its nuclear weapons.\n\nNorth Korea had already announced, at a ruling party meeting last month, that it has suspended all tests of nuclear devices and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and the plan to close the nuclear testing ground.\n\nThe closure of the site could be a useful precedent for Washington and Seoul as they proceed with nuclear negotiations with Pyongyang, analysts say. Adam Mount, a senior defense analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, stated, \"Now that North Korea has accepted in principle that agreements should be verified, U.S. negotiators should hold them to this standard for any subsequent agreement.\" Mount further added, \"It will make it more difficult for Kim Jong Un to deny inspections now that he has placed them on the table.\"\n\nNorth Korea's six known nuclear tests have taken place at the Punggye-ri site, where a system of tunnels has been dug under Mount Mantap, according to Reuters.",
    " Title: U.S. and Russia Reach Agreement on Securing Syria's Chemical Weapons Stockpile, Averting U.S. Military Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant diplomatic development, the United States and Russia have reached an agreement on securing Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively removing the threat of U.S. military action. The agreement, announced on Saturday, follows over two weeks of tense rhetoric and an unsuccessful attempt by President Obama to gain congressional and public support for a limited military strike.\n\nThe agreement, brokered in a last-minute diplomatic push led by the Russians, will see Syria's chemical weapons stockpile removed or destroyed by 2014. International inspections will begin by November, and the Syrians will offer full disclosure of their chemical weapons arsenal within a week. Any potential violations by the Syrian regime will be taken to the United Nations Security Council for response.\n\nPresident Obama, in a Saturday afternoon statement, acknowledged the progress made but emphasized that \"much more work remains to be done.\" Secretary of State John Kerry, who negotiated the agreement with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Geneva, was more direct, stating, \"We have committed to a standard that says verify and verify.\"\n\nThe deal's implementation will be closely scrutinized by a Congress that is wary of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President Bashar Assad. President Obama's relationship with Putin is strained, with the two leaders often at odds over Syria policy and Putin's decision to grant temporary asylum to former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nThe deal's success hinges on Syria's commitment to the agreed-upon timeline and disclosure of its chemical weapons. Sen. Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed skepticism, stating that Syria's willingness to follow through is \"very much an open question.\"\n\nThe agreement offers President Obama a way out of his unpopular call for military action, but it may make it more difficult to hold the Assad regime accountable for the August 21 chemical attack that killed over 1,400 Syrian civilians. The deal's implementation will be closely watched, and its success will determine whether it meets President Obama's goal of denying the Assad regime the ability to conduct another chemical attack.",
    " Title: Chelsea Manning Released from Prison After 62-Day Contempt of Court Detention\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning has been released from prison after a 62-day confinement for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating Wikileaks. Manning, 31, was held in custody following a Virginia judge's order in March. However, she will have to appear again before the grand jury on May 16.\n\nManning was found guilty in 2013 of charges including espionage for leaking secret military files to Wikileaks, but her sentence was later commuted. She has refused to answer further questions about Wikileaks from investigators, citing that she has already presented her testimony during her 2013 trial.\n\nIn a statement, her lawyers announced, \"Today marked the expiration of the term of the grand jury, and so, after 62 days of confinement, Chelsea was released from the Alexandria Detention Center earlier today.\" The statement further added, \"Unfortunately, even prior to her release, Chelsea was served with another subpoena. It is therefore conceivable that she will once again be held in contempt of court and be returned [to custody].\"\n\nWhen Manning refused to testify in March, her lawyers reportedly asked for her to be confined at home due to medical issues, but the judge said US Marshals would address her care needs.\n\nUS prosecutors have been investigating Wikileaks for years, and in November, prosecutors inadvertently revealed possible charges against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in court documents from a separate case. Manning was arrested in Iraq in 2010 for disclosing more than 700,000 confidential documents, videos, and diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy website.\n\nWhile Manning said she only did so to spark debates about foreign policy, US officials said the leak put lives at risk. She was sentenced to 35 years after being found guilty of 20 charges related to the leak, but then-President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017. Her sentence was the longest given for a leak in US history. President Obama said it was \"disproportionate\" to her crimes.",
    " Title: Obama's Speech on National Security Agency Reforms: Former NSA Director Expects Few Changes, Emphasis on Reassurance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn anticipation of President Barack Obama's upcoming speech on changes to the National Security Agency (NSA), former NSA Director Michael Hayden has stated that he does not expect any significant alterations in the way the government collects intelligence.\n\nDuring an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Hayden expressed his belief that the speech would focus on reassuring the public rather than implementing transformative changes. He suggested that the language of the speech would emphasize transparency, checks and balances, and reform, but the substance would primarily involve maintaining the status quo.\n\nHayden also indicated that the NSA's data collection practices are unlikely to change in the near future. Shortly after his appearance on MSNBC, news broke that Obama would propose the NSA to relinquish control over the phone data it collects, but no alternative collector was specified.\n\nAccording to Hayden, the primary task for Obama in his speech is to reassure the public about the intelligence agencies' activities. He stated, \"His mission here, I don't think, is to change what we\u2019re doing. His mission here is to make people more comfortable about what it is that the intelligence agencies are doing.\"\n\nHayden identified two key questions that Obama will need to address in the NSA's phone data collection: where the data is stored and how it can be queried. He anticipates that the president will delegate the first question to Congress, while the NSA will continue to hold the data.\n\nRegarding the second question, Hayden expressed concern about requiring intelligence agencies to seek a judge's approval every time they want to query data. He noted that, as the director of the NSA prior to 9/11, such a requirement would feel like a pre-9/11 mindset and make him uncomfortable.\n\nThe president's 11 a.m. speech is the culmination of a months-long review of the surveillance programs made public last summer by leaker Edward Snowden. Prior to Hayden's interview, the White House had not confirmed the specific changes Obama would propose.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates' Performance and Critiques in the Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe first Democratic presidential debate of 2020 saw Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker receive praise for their performances, while facing critiques on certain aspects.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren presented a consistent message on domestic politics, emphasizing her goal to make government work for the majority of Americans. She shared her personal story, highlighting her humble beginnings and the impact of government-funded education on her life. Warren expressed her ambition to provide the same opportunities to every American, believing that America can still offer such opportunities with a united movement.\n\nWarren's policy proposals were commended for their simplicity and directness, a quality that is not commonly found in senators. However, her Medicare for All plan drew criticism for its potential to replace all private health insurance, which could alienate a significant portion of potential supporters.\n\nSenator Cory Booker delivered a compelling speech on a variety of issues, including immigration and healthcare. He called for a return to a sense of common purpose in the country, aiming to beat President Trump in the election. Booker's performance served as a reminder of his political skills and potential to play a significant role in the race.\n\nCritics noted that the candidates, including Warren, seemed to dodge questions regarding GOP obstruction, particularly Mitch McConnell's efforts to block Democratic initiatives. The candidates' responses suggested that their proposals would remain unimplemented without a Democratic president, House, and Senate in 2021.\n\nThe debate questions received mixed reviews, with some praising the moderators for not dedicating much time to foreign policy. However, the lightning round format, in which candidates were asked to name the \"greatest geopolitical threat\" in one word, was criticized for its lack of nuance and its assumption that the best way to assess a potential president's foreign policy is by finding out what they fear most. This format was seen as promoting a simplistic and potentially dangerous view of the world.",
    " Title: California Bishop Calls for Tighter Gun Control in Letter to U.S. Senators\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a written petition to U.S. senators, Bishop Stephen Blair, chairman of the bishops' Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development in California, has called for stricter gun control measures. The Catholic News Agency reported that the bishop believes such measures would help build a \"culture of life\" and reduce gun violence.\n\nIn his letter, Bishop Blair referenced the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, stating it as a positive step towards addressing the issue of gun violence. The bill, if enacted, would implement restrictions and regulations aimed at reducing gun violence and saving lives.\n\nThe bishop specifically advocated for the federal government to restrict civilian access to high-capacity ammunition magazines and to ban all assault-type weapons.\n\nWhile some members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops have expressed support for stronger gun controls, the Catholic Church has not adopted a political policy on the issue. Pope John Paul II, in his Evangelium Vitae in 1995, stated that guns can be used in self-defense, aligning with church teachings.\n\nBishop Blair's call for tighter gun control comes as President Obama continues to push for stricter gun control measures. The Senate is expected to discuss gun control issues on Thursday, following a deal brokered by Senators Pat Toomey (Pennsylvania Republican) and Joe Manchin (West Virginia Democrat) on background checks.",

The three images, taken in June 2002, June 2008, and June 2014, depict the state's water loss, with orange and red colors indicating greater water loss.\n\nThe Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins, which encompass the Central Valley, have suffered the most significant losses. Between 2011 and 2014, these river basins lost approximately 4 trillion gallons of water each year, which is more than California's 38 million residents use in cities and homes annually.\n\nAs of Thursday, 100% of California was in a drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Over 58% of the state is in \"exceptional\" drought, the worst level. Record warmth has contributed to the drought, as the state experiences its hottest year since records began in 1895, according to data from the National Climatic Data Center.\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown declared a statewide drought emergency earlier this year. Since then, reservoir storage levels have continued to fall, and as of Thursday, they were down to about 52% of the historical average. Regulations restricting outdoor water use were implemented in late July for the entire state. People are not allowed to hose down driveways or sidewalks, nor are they allowed to water lawns and landscapes (if there is excess runoff). There are reports of wells running dry in central California.\n\nAdditionally, about 1,000 more wildfires than usual have affected the state, including some unusual ones in the spring.",
    " Title: North Korean Leader's Hotel Choice Sparks Last-Minute Relocation of White House Press Corps\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un chose to stay at the same hotel as the White House press corps during his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam. This decision, initially hailed by South Korean media and experts as a strategic move to expose himself to the American press, led to a last-minute relocation of the White House press pool.\n\nBefore Kim's arrival, the Melia Hotel was expected to host the press center for hundreds of visiting American journalists. However, minutes after Kim arrived at a Vietnamese border station on Tuesday, the Vietnamese foreign ministry announced that the Melia Hanoi Hotel would no longer serve as the press center.\n\nThe White House press pool was instead relocated to a shared working space set up for visiting journalists at the Viet Xo Friendship Cultural Labour Palace, a large Soviet-era building a few blocks from the Melia. The fate of the journalists who had booked to stay in the Melia remains unclear.\n\nDuring Kim's first summit with Trump in Singapore last year, reporters and other guests at the hotel were herded back and ordered to pocket phones and cameras when Kim moved through the hotel. Some guests who took photographs of the leader had their photos deleted.\n\nKim and Trump will meet in Hanoi on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss a North Korean pledge to give up its nuclear weapons program. The Melia had been widely expected to host Kim during his stay in Hanoi. Sources told media outlets last week that the North Korean leader would stay there, and Kim's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, based himself in the hotel during a visit to Vietnam in November last year.\n\nKim's close aide Kim Chang Son also inspected the hotel before the summit. On Monday, a member of staff at the hotel told media outlets that the White House press center had been set up on the third floor, and an entire ballroom had been reserved for the North Korean delegation. Despite these signs, the Melia was still considered a potential location for the White House press until Kim set foot off his train. A reporter from a certain media outlet was evicted from the Melia hotel lobby before Kim arrived.\n\nCheong Seong-chang, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute, commented after Kim arrived at the hotel, \"It was hard to understand in the first place.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Tariffs Harm U.S. Economy Due to Impact on Intermediate Goods, According to Tax Theory\n\nArticle:\n\nNoah Smith, a former assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University and opinion columnist, argues that President Donald Trump's tariffs are a detrimental move for the U.S. economy due to their impact on intermediate goods. According to Smith, tax theory suggests that intermediate goods, such as steel for cars or transistors for computer chips, should not be taxed because taxing inputs causes companies to produce less, resulting in a smaller economic pie to divide among consumers.\n\nChad Brown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics provides data that most of the $50 billion worth of Chinese products Trump is threatening to impose tariffs on are intermediate goods or capital goods. This, according to Smith, will negatively affect a large number of U.S. companies, particularly manufacturers.\n\nSmith suggests that if Trump wants to boost American manufacturing, he should not use taxes to restrict the materials and equipment U.S. factories need. Instead, he proposes focusing tariffs on consumer goods or implementing a Value-Added Tax (VAT) in the U.S. VATs, which let companies deduct the cost of their intermediate goods when paying taxes, are a highly efficient form of taxation.\n\nSmith also suggests using the VAT to fund health care, housing subsidies, and other services for poor Americans, addressing the concern that VATs tend to hit the poor harder than the rich. He notes that a VAT might satisfy Trump's desire for a trade war, as he seems to view VATs as a kind of tariff on imported goods, although this is not accurate.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or the owners of \u2588\u2588\u2588 LP.",
    " Title: Former FBI Deputy Director McCabe Expresses Concern Over Reputation Amidst Ongoing Public Attacks from President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who served a 21-year career with the bureau, expressed concern over the impact of President Trump's public attacks on his reputation. McCabe stated that the real damage is being inflicted on the FBI, law enforcement, and the special counsel.\n\nDuring one of the most tumultuous periods in the FBI's history, McCabe served as the second in command and oversaw investigations into both the Trump campaign and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. He assumed the role of acting FBI director following the sudden firing of his predecessor, James Comey, and publicly contradicted the White House on national television regarding the support of rank-and-file FBI agents for Comey.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly singled out McCabe for public criticism, suggesting that he helped protect Clinton from prosecution during the 2016 presidential campaign. The president cited the fact that McCabe's wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat for a State Senate seat in Virginia and received hundreds of thousands of dollars from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons, as evidence of bias.\n\nAs recently as Thursday, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, stated that McCabe had \"troubling behavior\" and was a \"bad actor.\" McCabe's lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich, described these comments as \"vile and defamatory\" and claimed they were intended to put pressure on the Department of Justice.\n\nMrs. McCabe lost her race, and McCabe was later promoted to deputy director, where he oversaw the investigation into Clinton. No charges were filed in that case, and Trump has pointed to the donations to Mrs. McCabe's campaign as evidence of FBI bias.",
    " Title: McConnell Assures No Default on Debt as Congressional Focus Shifts to Borrowing Limit and Tax Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has stated that there is \"zero chance\" Congress will allow the U.S. to default on its debts by failing to increase the borrowing limit. McConnell made these comments during a joint appearance in Kentucky with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday.\n\nThe event marked one of McConnell's first public appearances since President Donald Trump publicly criticized him for failing to pass a repeal and replacement of former President Barack Obama's health care law. McConnell did not mention Trump in his remarks and did not take questions from reporters after the event.\n\nWhen asked about his news sources, McConnell said he reads a variety of outlets, including The New York Times. In response to a question about where he gets his news, McConnell said, \"My view is most news is not fake. I try not to fall in love with any particular source.\"\n\nThe U.S. government currently has enough money to pay its bills until Sept. 29. After that date, Congress would need to grant permission for the government to borrow more money to meet its obligations, including Social Security and interest payments.\n\nMcConnell sought to reassure a crowd of nervous business leaders by interjecting at the end of Mnuchin's answer to a question about what would happen if lawmakers did not increase the borrowing limit. \"Let me just add, there is zero chance, no chance, we won't raise the debt ceiling,\" McConnell said. \"America is not going to default.\"\n\nAs the most pressing issue when lawmakers return to Washington following their August recess, addressing the country's borrowing limit will take center stage. After that, Republicans are expected to turn their attention to overhauling the nation's tax code.\n\nMcConnell also addressed the likelihood of repealing a pair of Obama-era laws most disliked by conservatives. While negotiations about health care are ongoing, McConnell said the path forward is \"somewhat murky.\" He also stated that it would be \"challenging\" to lift the restrictions placed on banks following the 2008 financial crisis, known as \"Dodd-Frank.\"\n\nOn tax reform, McConnell said the only things lawmakers won't consider eliminating are deductions on mortgage interest and charitable deductions. The specifics of tax reform have yet to be determined.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Officially Announces 2016 Presidential Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has officially announced her intention to seek the 2016 Democratic nomination for president on Sunday afternoon, ending years of speculation over her plans to pursue the Oval Office. According to sources familiar with the campaign plan, Clinton will make the announcement via a video and social media, although the exact method has not been confirmed.\n\nAt this point, Mrs. Clinton faces minimal competition for the Democratic nomination. Polls barely register former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley or former Virginia Senator Jim Webb. One potential heavyweight, Vice President Joe Biden, has expressed interest in a campaign but has taken few apparent steps to prepare. On Thursday, former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee surprisingly joined the field and offered a critical critique from the left of Mrs. Clinton's record on foreign policy. \"The biggest question will be: What exactly did you accomplish in your four years as secretary of state?\" he said in an interview. \"There was a lot of dust in the air. Not many concrete accomplishments.\"\n\nAnnouncing now gives Clinton an edge, as she lost a bitter contest to then-Senator Barack Obama for her party's nomination in 2008. The early announcement would provide her fundraising team more time to generate the hundreds of millions of dollars typically necessary to mount a successful presidential bid.\n\nFollowing the Sunday announcement, Clinton is expected to travel to the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa early next week for campaign events. Democratic strategists and advisers spoke on condition of anonymity because Clinton has not yet finalized all aspects of her announcement plan, according to The Washington Post. NPR's Mara Liasson reports that Clinton is expected to stay in Iowa for at least a month of small, unscripted events with small groups of voters.",
    " Title: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel Condemns Rep. Ilhan Omar's Anti-Semitic Comments in The Atlantic Op-Ed\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an opinion piece published in The Atlantic on Thursday, former Obama Chief of Staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel criticized Representative Ilhan Omar's recent anti-Semitic comments. Emanuel's stance differs from other Democrats who view Omar's comments as criticism of Israel rather than anti-Semitic remarks.\n\nEmanuel stated unequivocally, \"Her remarks are not anti-Israel; they are anti-Semitic.\" He argued that Omar's comments perpetuate age-old stereotypes about Jews, such as the trope of dual loyalty, which has been used by anti-Semites throughout history.\n\nEmanuel, who has faced questions of dual loyalty in his political career, noted that this trope has been aimed at Jews in various countries for centuries. By embracing this trope, Omar, according to Emanuel, is associating herself with historical events such as the Spanish Inquisition, Russian pogroms, and the Holocaust.\n\nHowever, Emanuel clarified that a politician can be critical of Israel without being anti-Semitic. He emphasized the strong relationship between the United States and Israel, highlighting their shared values and national interests. Jewish Americans who support Israel, he said, do so because of the commonality of their values and interests.\n\nEmanuel also acknowledged that Omar, as a Muslim in Congress, faces adversities, but he argued that these circumstances should not excuse her from the consequences of her anti-Semitic remarks. He concluded by praising Emanuel for his courage in calling out Omar's anti-Semitism.",
    " Title: The Role of Individuals in America's Reopening Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate between governors and President Trump over who holds the authority to reopen America, it is crucial to recognize that the power to reopen lies not with politicians, but with individuals, families, businesses, and religious congregations. Politicians can facilitate the process by lifting lockdown orders and school closures, but the decision to resume normal activities ultimately rests with the individuals and groups mentioned above.\n\nNate Silver, a renowned data analyst and pandemic guide, aptly stated, \"people will vote with their feet.\" The desire for social interaction, the need for economic activity, and the religious inclinations of Americans will drive the reopening process, not top-down orders from politicians.\n\nThe desire for family reunions, the need for businesses to operate, and the religious needs of Americans are strong motivators. Businesses, having invested resources in their establishments, will reopen when they can do so safely and profitably. The first business to reopen, if it does so safely, will likely attract a crowd of paying customers.\n\nReligious institutions also play a significant role in the reopening process. The New Boston Post, in an editorial, emphasized the importance of churches in tending to people's spiritual needs. Church leaders should devise plans for reopening their churches, setting a specific date for resuming services. The editorial argues that governors cannot order churches to close, as the role of government in religious matters is limited by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTimothy P. Carney, writing for The Washington Examiner, suggests that churches could reopen with social distancing measures in place, making worship services safer than shopping at a store like Home Depot, which remains open.\n\nHowever, the primary motivators in this situation are the desire to stay alive and to avoid infecting others. Each individual decision carries potential risks, and the consequences of one person's actions can affect others. But this is not a new concept in American life, and it has not previously led to nationwide or statewide lockdowns.\n\nThe best approach to reopening America is one that aligns with American values, emphasizing freedom, competition, choice, and diversity, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach or authoritarianism. The role of government is to protect the natural or God-given freedoms of individuals, families, businesses, and religions, rather than controlling their activities, even in the name of public health.",
    " Title: Local Governments Urged to Mobilize Resources During COVID-19 Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is posing a significant challenge to society, comparable to the Great Depression and World War II. The baby boomer generation is currently facing the first major societal challenge in their lifetime, and the response to this virus will determine the impact of its spread.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt utilized the federal government to create jobs and stimulate the economy. Automobile companies shifted production from cars to military equipment, and millions of people joined the military to support the war efforts. This generation, often referred to as the Greatest Generation, made significant sacrifices to preserve America's freedom and democracy.\n\nNow, local governments are being called upon to take action during this crisis. With many people losing jobs and struggling to pay for basic necessities, local governments are being asked to provide essential services such as housing, food, and childcare.\n\nCary Bozeman, a commissioner for the Port of Bremerton and former mayor of Bremerton, has urged local governments in Kitsap County, including Bremerton, Poulsbo, Port Orchard, Bainbridge Island, and the school districts, to take action to support their citizens during this difficult time. Bozeman believes that local governments have the ability to quickly and efficiently deliver services to their communities.\n\nBozeman suggests that local governments should work together to ensure that people do not lose their housing and have access to food and childcare for working parents. He believes that local governments should tap into their reserves or even borrow money at low interest rates to provide the necessary resources.\n\nBozeman emphasizes that local governments cannot rely solely on federal or state assistance and that local leaders must step forward, develop a plan, and support those most in need during this challenging time. Bozeman's call to action is a reminder that, as a community, we have the ability to mobilize and support each other during this difficult period in our lives.",
    " Title: Hugo Chavez: A Controversial Leader of Venezuela\n\nArticle:\n\nHugo Chavez, a charismatic and divisive figure, served as the President of Venezuela from 1999 until his death in 2013. Known for his leftist ideology and fervent opposition to the United States, Chavez sought to transform Venezuela into a socialist state. His presidency was marked by economic struggles, political polarization, and international controversy.\n\nBorn in a poor family in 1954 in the Great Savannah, Chavez joined the military as a youth and attempted to overthrow Venezuela's government in 1992. After his release from prison, he was mentored by Luis Miquilena, a prominent Venezuelan leftist leader. Miquilena convinced Chavez to abandon plans for a violent overthrow and pursue democratic means to rise to power.\n\nChavez won the presidency in a landslide election in 1998, capitalizing on the Venezuelan people's growing discontent with the traditional political parties. He was inaugurated the following year. During his years in power, Chavez was omnipresent, with his face on billboards and his voice dominating the airwaves. His main platform was a Sunday TV show, \"Hello Mr. President,\" where he railed against American leaders and built a connection with poor Venezuelans.\n\nChavez's greatest success, according to former Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel, was making those who had been marginalized feel part of something bigger. Chavez used his political capital and a powerful base to launch what he called 21st Century Socialism, nationalizing companies, seizing farmland, and forming alliances with like-minded leaders who opposed the United States.\n\nChavez's policies and alliances, however, were not without controversy. He provided subsidized oil to Communist Cuba, irking Washington, and supported a violent guerrilla movement in neighboring Colombia, according to internal Colombian government documents and interviews with former Colombian guerrillas. Some of his closest allies included controversial leaders such as Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nAt home, Chavez jailed some opponents and labeled his critics as degenerates and squealing pigs. Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue policy group, stated that despite the elections Chavez won, his government was far from democratic. \"He, over time, concentrated power in his own hands. There were very few checks and constraints on his authority. He made all the decisions. No one else. Institutions like the judiciary were completely controlled by Chavez,\" Shifter said. \"So in the end, he really was an autocrat and despot.\"\n\nDespite the economic struggles and political polarization, Chavez maintained fervent supporters throughout his rule. His charisma, folksy humor, and connection with the poor resonated with millions of Venezuelans. He was enthralling to an international left yearning for a magnetic leader, as evidenced by director Oliver Stone's glowing documentary, \"South of the Border.\" However, the rosy gloss often did not align with reality.",
    " Title: Marine Shoots, Kills Two Fellow Service Members at Virginia Base, Then Apparent Suicide\n\nArticle:\n\nA Marine shot and killed two of his fellow service members at Marine Corps Base Quantico on Thursday night, and then apparently killed himself, base officials said. The incident took place at the Marine Corps Base Quantico, where the shooter gunned down a man and a woman, the spokesmen said. All are Marines - permanent personnel assigned to the officer candidate school.\n\nAuthorities did not disclose a motive and were investigating the incident. The identities of the victims were not immediately disclosed as authorities worked to notify next of kin.\n\nThe incident shocked the military community. It comes as the Corps grieves over another tragedy: the deaths of seven U.S. Marines in a training exercise in Nevada on Monday.\n\nSecretary of Defense Chuck Hagel \"was saddened to learn of the shootings at Marine Corps Base Quantico,\" Pentagon spokesman George Little said Friday. \"This tragedy, as well as the tragedy in Nevada earlier this week, took the lives of Marines who volunteered to serve their nation. His heart and his prayers are with them and their families. He believes that the legendary strength of the United States Marine Corps will ensure that they are forever remembered,\" Little said.\n\nEarly Marine accounts said the notification of the shooting came late Thursday when authorities found one dead victim. Using a public address system, police announced a lockdown at the base and surrounded the building where the suspect was believed to be barricaded. They ordered everyone to stay in their homes, doors locked, they said.\n\nAuthorities from the base and Prince William County, Virginia, surrounded the shooter, who was in a barracks not far from where the first shooting occurred. Law enforcement officials entered the barracks two hours later and discovered the shooter dead, apparently of a self-inflicted wound. The female victim was in the room with him, fatally shot.\n\nThe lockdown ended early Friday, a few hours after it started. As dawn rose over the base, Maxwell told reporters that there were no barricades or a standoff but did not elaborate. The incident was confined to a single barracks at the candidate school.\n\nHe said \"quick\" police reaction helped resolve the situation, first reported at 10:30 p.m. via an emergency call. Soon, security was heightened, and a mass notification was issued throughout the base. Base restrictions were lifted a few hours later. Others in the officer candidate school were \"accounted for and safe.\"\n\n\"As we take care of our Marines and their families that are dealing with this tragedy, I'd also ask for the support of our neighbors, the community, and their thoughts and prayers as well for our Marines who have lost their comrades-in-arms,\" Maxwell said.\n\nVisitors to the base will see a grand statue: the Iwo Jima Monument. It gives all who enter pause about the important role the base has played in training generations of Marines in forging military doctrine and fighting America's wars.\n\nThe statue depicts the historic flag-raising on Mount Suribachi, on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima, during the famous World War II battle there. The Quantico base, started during World War I, has been integral in training, education, and forging military doctrine for America's battles.\n\nEarly on, amphibious warfare was, the corps said, \"conceived and perfected\" there. The Marines there came up with the idea \"of carrying troops from ship to shore by helicopter.\" Now, it's home to the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, which conducts experiments in modern warfare.\n\n\"This is perhaps the only command whose mission touches the farthest reaches of the Corps; decisions made here impact Marines aboard ship, fighting in the Global War on Terrorism, on guard duty at embassies across the globe, and reserve duty throughout the United States,\" the Marines said. Federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI, share training facilities there. The base also has a reputation across popular culture as a key national security training location. Jack Ryan, writer Tom Clancy's well-known character in novels and films, for example, took officer training there.",
    " Title: White House Physician Confirms President Trump's Health and Cognitive Ability\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a news conference on Tuesday, the White House physician, Navy Rear Adm. Dr. Ronny Jackson, presented the results of his examination of President Trump last week, confirming the President's physical and mental health and fitness for office.\n\nThe detailed description of the President's health provided by Dr. Jackson indicates that, for a 71-year-old male, President Trump is in excellent health and likely will remain so for years to come. The liberal media, in their follow-up questions, were reportedly attempting to find any flaws in Dr. Jackson's report, questioning not only normal findings but also alleging that the White House doctor may not be telling the whole truth.\n\nPresident Trump passed the cognitive test with a perfect score of 30 out of 30. This impressive result was corroborated by the medical team, reinforcing their personal impression of the President's normal and healthy cognitive abilities. Aside from the well-known fact that the President has a history of high cholesterol and takes a small dose of cholesterol-lowering medication, there appear to be no other medical findings of concern.\n\nThe cognitive ability tests, which are psychometric assessments designed to measure general intelligence, were administered to the President. These tests evaluate a person's cognitive ability in areas such as numerical, verbal, abstract, spatial, and mechanical reasoning. This helps to measure normal brain health and can detect declines in function, as well as conditions like Alzheimer's or age-related dementia.\n\nThe President's perfect score on the cognitive test has put to rest any speculation about the President's mental fitness. This press conference was transparent, and the amount of information disclosed was commendable. The medical team at the White House is believed to have done President Trump justice, and the recommendations of diet and exercise are the only prescriptions necessary.",
    " Title: French Authorities Conduct Raid on Paris Suburb, Detain Eight and Thwart Potential Attacks\n\nArticle:\n\nFrench authorities conducted a raid on a suspected hideout of the alleged mastermind behind the deadly Paris attacks on Wednesday, resulting in eight detentions, two deaths, and potentially thwarted further bloodshed. The operation took place in the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis.\n\nAccording to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, the suspected ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, may have been present in the apartment building during the raid, but this is unclear. Residents in the area reported seeing Abaaoud in the neighborhood and at a local mosque.\n\nInvestigators zeroed in on the building after intercepting phone conversations indicating that a relative of Abaaoud might be there. The raid was met with resistance, including an armored door, a woman who detonated a suicide vest, and gunfire exchanged for approximately an hour. The French police used powerful munitions, causing one floor of the building to collapse.\n\nThe violence resulted in body parts, which are being tested through DNA analysis. Neither Abaaoud nor suspect Salah Abdeslam, who has been sought since the attacks, were among those detained in the operation, according to Molins.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande described the intense standoff as further proof that \"we are at war\" with ISIS. He stated, \"What the terrorists were targeting was what France represents. This is what was attacked on the night of November 13.\"\n\nISIS has drawn international attention for taking over large areas of Iraq and Syria, leaving a trail of violence and destruction in its wake. This month alone, ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, the downing of a Russian passenger jet in Egypt, and a pair of suicide bombings in Beirut.\n\nFrance had already been part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS with airstrikes. In response to the series of shootings and explosions in Paris last week, which killed 129 people, France has stepped up its efforts against ISIS. President Hollande has proposed extending France's state of emergency for three more months, giving authorities greater powers in conducting searches, holding people, and dissolving certain groups.\n\nTo combat the Islamist extremist group, President Hollande also plans to appeal to world leaders, including meeting next week with U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who have been at odds on what to do in Syria.\n\nWhoever was inside the Saint-Denis apartment on Wednesday appeared to be \"prepared to act\" in possibly another attack, according to Molins. The operation involved 110 police, who swarmed a diverse, working-class area that is home to the Stade de France sports stadium, where three suicide bombings took place days earlier.\n\nThe raid led authorities to another apartment on the same street. Molins described the operation as complex, with almost an hour of uninterrupted gunfire as police tried to gain entry. The violent standoff left residents in the area, already shaken by last week's attacks, startled and scared.\n\nThree people in the Saint-Denis building, including one with a bullet wound in the arm, are among the eight detained, according to Molins. The others include the person who loaned the apartment to the suspected terrorists and his friend. Two of the eight held were hospitalized, according to Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet.\n\nResidents in the area were shocked by the events unfolding in their neighborhood. Saadana Aymen, a 29-year-old who lives one street down, expressed his surprise, stating, \"When you think of Saint-Denis, you don't think of terrorists.\"\n\nAuthorities conducted further raids in other locations on Tuesday night into Wednesday, resulting in the detention of at least 25 people, the confiscation of 34 weapons, and the discovery of illicit drugs in 16 instances. The authorities have not provided details about the arrests or said what connection they could have to Friday's attacks.\n\nInvestigators are working to piece together the movements and contacts of the terrorists in the days and hours leading up to the attacks. They have found at least one piece of evidence that could help them in their search: one of the attacker's cell phones was found in a trash bin outside the Bataclan theater, where most of Friday's victims were gunned down. A message on the phone, according to Molins, said, \"Here we go, it's starting.\"\n\nAuthorities are trying to determine who the message was sent to and whether the suspected ringleader in the attack is still on the run or whether his remains were found in the rubble.",
    " Title: \"Unfavorable Voters Could Impact 2020 Presidential Election, New Poll Suggests\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA new Morning Consult poll suggests that voters who hold unfavorable views of both President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden could play a significant role in the 2020 presidential election. Unlike in 2016, this group might not favor Trump, who previously benefited from such voters due to their perceived lesser dislike of him compared to Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn 2016, exit polling showed that voters who did not like either major party candidate favored Trump over Clinton by a 17-point margin. However, the new Morning Consult poll indicates that Biden has a 29-point lead with the same group, with a 19-point advantage when undecided voters are forced to make a choice.\n\nThe poll also reveals that this group holds more negative views of Trump, with 66 percent saying they have very unfavorable views of the president, compared to 40 percent for Biden. This data is based on voters who express unfavorable views of both candidates.\n\nThe impact of the so-called \"haters demographic\" on the election depends on several factors. Geographic limitations due to the Electoral College, polling inaccuracies, and the role of third parties are among these factors.\n\nThe geographic limitation arises from the Electoral College system, which restricts the influence of voter anger in states that are traditionally blue or red. For instance, a Californian's dislike for Joe Biden will not change California's blue status.\n\nThe poll's accuracy can be questionable, as it categorizes individuals based on their responses. Some voters might dislike both candidates but have already made up their minds. For example, many conservatives might have voted for Trump in 2016 not because they particularly liked him but because they wanted a Republican president to appoint judges.\n\nThe role of third parties is another factor. The abysmal approval ratings for Trump and Clinton in 2016 likely contributed to the record-shattering number of votes received by former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee.\n\nThis year's Libertarian ticket, led by Jo Jorgensen, is not expected to match Johnson's performance. The Morning Consult poll did not include any third-party candidates, so it may overlook whether members of the \"haters demographic\" might refuse to vote for both Trump and Biden, opting instead to stay home or support an alternative candidate they like.\n\nWith negative partisanship driving much of American politics, it is not surprising that voters with a negative view of both Trump and Biden are likely to decide the election. With more than 100 days until the polls close, both candidates will have ample opportunities to address this demographic.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney Announces Senate Bid in Utah, Seeking Political Comeback\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, announced on Friday his intention to run for the U.S. Senate in Utah to succeed the retiring Orrin Hatch. In a tweet, Romney stated, \"I am running for United States Senate to serve the people of Utah and bring Utah's values to Washington.\"\n\nRomney, who is considered a heavy favorite for the Senate seat, has emerged as a prominent critic of President Trump. If he wins, he could potentially cause challenges for the administration from across Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nBorn in Michigan, Romney has deep ties to Utah. He attended Brigham Young University in Provo and played a significant role in turning around the scandal-plagued 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, moving to the state after losing the 2012 presidential race.\n\nA video message posted on Twitter on Friday highlights Romney's Olympics background and offers voters an early look at his platform. In the video, Romney emphasizes fiscal responsibility, job creation, and a moderate approach on immigration, which appears to be a critique of Trump's policies.\n\n\"Utah has a lot to teach the politicians in Washington,\" Romney says in the video. \"Utah has balanced its budgets. Washington is buried in debt. Utah exports more abroad than it imports. Washington has that backwards. Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world. Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion.\"\n\nThe announcement was widely anticipated, although it was delayed following Wednesday's mass shooting at a Florida high school. Utah Republican Party Chairman Rob Anderson earlier this week criticized Romney, stating, \"Mitt Romney does not live here, his kids were not born here, he does not shop here.\" Anderson later apologized for his comments, acknowledging that they came across as disparaging or unsupportive.\n\nDespite Romney's past criticism of President Trump, Democrats attempted to portray the two as ideologically aligned. Democratic National Committee spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement, \"While Mitt Romney desperately wants to separate himself from the extremism of the current administration, the basic policies of Trump's GOP \u2013 whether it's tax cuts for the rich or reversing the progress of the ACA \u2013 were his before they were Donald Trump's.\" Patel continued, \"Utah deserves a Senator who will expand opportunities and fight to improve the lives of everyone, not another multi-millionaire looking out for himself, his rich neighbors, and the special interests.\"\n\nRomney reportedly reached out to Anderson regarding his comments and accepted the apology. As Chairman of the Utah Republican Party, Anderson pledged to treat all candidates equally to ensure a fair path to the Party nomination.",
    " Title: Pressure to Close Guantanamo Bay Prison Mounts as Funding and Housing Issues Persist\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States' Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, colloquially known as Gitmo, remains a contentious issue, with calls to close the aging and deteriorating prison growing louder. Despite President Barack Obama's pledge to shut down Gitmo and an executive order signed in 2009 aiming for closure within a year, the prison continues to house 149 prisoners, with approximately 50 considered too dangerous for release.\n\nThe prison's infrastructure has reportedly deteriorated significantly, prompting the Southern Command to request $200 million in improvements last year. However, this request was denied by the Pentagon. General John F. Kelly, head of the U.S. Southern Command, which includes Joint Task Force Guantanamo, stated to The New York Times that the prison is \"a long way from being closed.\"\n\nThe main obstacle to closing Gitmo lies in the funding aspect. If funds are allocated for facility upgrades in anticipation of the prison's closure, those funds would be wasted if the prison remains open. Conversely, if the prison continues to operate without necessary improvements, critical issues persist.\n\nThe House of Representatives has voted to prohibit the transfer of prisoners, citing the Obama administration's alleged violation of law when five Taliban prisoners were released in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in May without sufficient notification to Congress. Rep. Howard \"Buck\" McKeon, California Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, stated to The New York Times that there is no support in the House for relaxing current restrictions or backing off the ban in light of the president's recent legal violations.\n\nAn attempt to transfer six detainees to Uruguay fell through at the last minute when Uruguayan President Jose Mujica withdrew from the deal.\n\nIn addition to political hurdles, the prison faces practical challenges. Leaking ceilings, buckling floors, and inadequate medical facilities cause constant problems at the aging prison. Approximately 6,000 service members and staff work at the prison complex, with taxpayer expense estimated at about $413 million in 2014, or approximately $3 million per prisoner per year. If the prisoners were housed in a U.S. federal penitentiary, costs would drop to about $30,280 per prisoner per year.\n\nRear Adm. Kyle Kozad, who heads the prison task force, told The New York Times, \"We are forced to at least forecast so that we're prepared if this detention facility is open two years from now, 12 years from now, 22 years from now, so that we're prepared to be able to continue to do the mission.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court's Actions on Death Penalty: A Legal Trivia or Constitutional Issue?\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debates surrounding the death penalty at the U.S. Supreme Court are not, as some headlines suggest, a matter of open feuding or sniping among justices. Instead, the court is addressing minor aspects of the death penalty's application, according to Damon Root, author of Overruled: The Long War for Control of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nCurrent Supreme Court actions regarding the death penalty primarily revolve around specific, technical issues such as the presence of religious figures in the death chamber and the pain experienced by individuals with rare diseases during lethal injection. These cases, while significant in their own right, do not challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty as a whole.\n\nThe Constitution, as written, supports capital punishment. The Fifth Amendment specifies certain limitations on the conditions in which a person may be \"deprived of life,\" and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of \"cruel and unusual punishment\" does not necessarily rule out capital punishment. The drafters of the Constitution did not believe that the Eighth Amendment prohibited capital punishment.\n\nArguments against the death penalty, such as the irreversibility of the punishment or the uneven application of the law, are often based on assumptions that may not stand up to scrutiny. These arguments are more appropriately directed towards procedural reform rather than the death penalty itself.\n\nThe Supreme Court's role is to interpret the Constitution, not to decide on the morality or acceptability of capital punishment. The more substantial arguments against the death penalty, such as its potential to add more violence and horror to society, are better suited for Congress and the states, which have the power to end the practice of capital punishment if they so choose.\n\nIn conclusion, the current debates surrounding the death penalty at the U.S. Supreme Court are primarily focused on technical, procedural issues rather than the constitutionality of capital punishment itself. The more substantial arguments against the death penalty are better addressed through procedural reform or legislative action.",
    " Title: Defense Secretary Mattis Labels North Korea a \"Clear and Present Danger,\" Criticizes China's Actions in South China Sea\n\nArticle:\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis, in a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, labeled North Korea as a \"clear and present danger\" and criticized China for its actions in the South China Sea. Mattis expressed hope for cooperation with China in ridding North Korea of its nuclear weapons, but was critical of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.\n\nIn his speech, Mattis emphasized the Trump administration's efforts to exhaust all possible alternatives to avert a nuclear arms race with North Korea, in violation of United Nations restrictions on its activities. He also criticized China for its disregard for international law by its \"indisputable militarization\" of artificial islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea.\n\nMattis called North Korea an \"urgent military threat\" and expressed concern about the possibility of a pre-emptive attack without warning South Korea in advance. He also highlighted the U.S. commitment to working with its global partners in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nRep. Mac Thornberry, a Republican from Texas and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, praised Mattis for effectively stressing the U.S. commitment to allies in the region.\n\nOverall, Mattis' speech struck a positive and hopeful tone for cooperation and peace in the Asia-Pacific region, where the U.S. has made it a priority to nurture and strengthen alliances and partnerships. Mattis also acknowledged the competition between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies, but emphasized that conflict is not inevitable.\n\nThe U.S. has about 28,500 troops permanently based in South Korea, a defense treaty ally.",
    " Title: Understanding National Debt: Factors, Implications, and Differences Between Developed and Developing Countries\n\nArticle:\n\nNational debt, a measure of a government's borrowing, is a significant indicator of a country's fiscal health. The critical factor to consider alongside national debt is a country's gross domestic product (GDP). According to Jeffrey Frankel, an economics professor at Harvard Kennedy School, the stability of a country's debt depends on whether it is decreasing as a share of GDP.\n\nThe amount of debt a country can handle safely depends on various factors. Rising debt can cause economic strain, as a larger portion of government expenditures is allocated for interest payments. However, in some cases, more borrowing may be justified, such as during economic stagnation, when the government may want to increase spending as a stimulus, investing in big infrastructure projects.\n\nThe levels of national debt differ significantly between developed and developing countries. Nicolas V\u00e9ron of the Peterson Institute for International Economics explains that this disparity is due to \"market discipline,\" as investors are less inclined to lend to emerging markets, where they perceive greater risk. V\u00e9ron further states, \"The more creditworthy you are, the more you can borrow. It's true of individuals; it's true of countries.\"\n\nRegarding the United States' national debt, it has been surging since the 1980s, currently close to $20 trillion, with an increasing percentage of GDP. While it is impossible to predict with certainty, most analysts expect significant tax cuts and spending increases under President Trump, which would likely result in a rising national debt.\n\nNational debt played a significant role in Europe's recent financial struggles. Some analysts question whether too much austerity was imposed during the 2009 crisis or whether it was imposed at the wrong time. Greece, considered an advanced economy, had \"lots of features of emerging markets,\" according to V\u00e9ron, and its debt levels before the crisis were far higher than they should have been. Frankel agrees, stating that Greece needed austerity before 2008 but did not have it; then, when the economy was already struggling, austerity was imposed. Frankel refers to renowned British economist John Maynard Keynes, stating that it's in the boom times that governments should cut back.",
    " Title: Colorado Pioneers Healthcare Price Transparency, Aiming to Simplify Cost Comparisons\n\nArticle:\n\nColorado is leading the way in making healthcare prices more transparent, with the ultimate goal of making it as easy for consumers to compare prices as shopping for a coffee maker. The state's efforts, spearheaded by a nonprofit organization called the Colorado Health Institute (CIVHC), aim to provide consumers with the information they need to make informed decisions about their healthcare services and costs.\n\nEdie Sonn, the CEO of CIVHC, explains that the organization's mission is to \"give you that information, so you can become an empowered consumer.\" The organization has been working to make health care prices publicly available in Colorado, and they have made significant progress in recent years.\n\nOne of the key tools CIVHC has used is an \"all-payer claims database,\" which collects a copy of every receipt for a health care service in a given state. This database aims to provide a comprehensive view of healthcare prices in Colorado. However, gathering and organizing this data has been a complex and time-consuming process.\n\n\"Claims data is dirty,\" says Sonn. \"It's really dirty. It takes a lot of scrubbing to make sense of it. It's complicated, time-consuming, and expensive.\"\n\nThe state has received funding for this effort from private grants, but those are now drying up. To continue making basic price information accessible to the public for free, the state is considering selling more complex, custom data reports to businesses within the health industry.\n\nDr. David Ehrenberger, the chief medical officer for Avista Adventist Hospital, outside Denver, is one such business that is interested in these reports. He would like to see reports that show not just how much his competitors are charging, but also their complication rates. This information would give him better negotiating power with big insurance companies.\n\nHowever, there is a glitch in the system. In order to create the reports that healthcare providers want, they need to include price information from all payers, and one of the biggest payers is Medicare. At the moment, CIVHC cannot use Medicare data in any of the custom reports they want to sell.\n\n\"Current federal law restricts what we can do with that Medicare data,\" says Sonn. \"The only thing you can use their data for is public reporting.\"\n\nCIVHC and other organizations like it have found support on Capitol Hill to allow them to sell Medicare data. A measure that would make that change is now part of a larger Medicare bill working its way through Congress. If it passes, Colorado will be one step closer to making shopping for healthcare as easy as shopping for a coffee maker.\n\nThis story is part of a partnership between NPR and Kaiser Health News.",
    " Title: Young Adult Uninsured Rate Drops Significantly in 2011, Attributed to Affordable Care Act Provision\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report released on Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates a significant decrease in the number of young adults without health insurance in 2011. The report, based on a federal survey of approximately 35,000 households, shows a 22% drop in the uninsured rate among young adults, marking the largest annual decline for any age group since the CDC began collecting data in 1997.\n\nThe study's author, Matthew Broaddus, a research analyst at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, attributes the increased coverage for young people to a provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that allows children to remain on their parents' insurance policies until they turn 26. Joseph Antos, a health care policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, concurs, stating that the ACA provision is the only plausible explanation for the increase.\n\nAccording to the data from the federal study, known as the National Health Interview Survey, the share of people aged 19 to 25 who lacked health insurance fell to 27.9%, down from 33.9% in 2010. This represents about 1.6 million fewer uninsured individuals in this age group. For the next age group, those aged 26 to 35, the share of the uninsured rose, further indicating that the health care law may be driving the decline among the younger group.\n\nThe dependents' provision of the health care law took effect in September 2010, and the number of uninsured young adults decreased that year as well, though by a smaller amount. Obama administration officials have pointed to this drop as evidence that the law, which was broadly opposed by Republicans, is having an effect.",
    " Title: Democratic Candidates Criticize Profit-Driven Enterprises During Debates\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring the opening round of the Democratic presidential debates, several candidates expressed criticism towards profit-making enterprises, viewing them as a significant threat to the United States. Here is a compilation of instances where profit was demonized during the debates:\n\n1. \"We've had an industrial policy in the United States for decades now, and it's basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do. Giant corporations have exactly one loyalty, and that is to profits. And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to Canada, they're going to do it.\"\n\n2. \"Health care\u2014it's not just a human right, it should be an American right. And I believe the best way to get there is Medicare for All. But I have an urgency about this. When I am president of the United States, I'm not going to wait. We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care. And on this debate, I'm sorry. There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America, from pharmaceutical companies to insurers.\"\n\n3. \"The insurance companies last year alone sucked $23 billion in profits out of the health care system, $23 billion. And that does not count the money that was paid to executives, the money that was spent lobbying Washington.\"\n\n4. \"I have been to some of the largest private prisons, which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration, and their immigration lockups.\"\n\n5. \"The debate we're having in our party right now is confusing, because the truth is there's a big difference between capitalism on the one hand and greed on the other. And so all the things that we're trying to change is when companies care more about profits when they do about people.\"\n\n6. \"I believe we need to get to universal health care as a right and not a privilege to single payer. The quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers. God bless the insurers, if they want to compete, they can certainly try, but they've never put people over their profits, and I doubt they ever will.\"\n\n7. \"Let's be clear. Let us be very clear. The function of health care today from the insurance and drug company perspective is not to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way. The function of the health care system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies.\"\n\n8. \"We will have Medicare for all when tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone, that health care is a human right, not something to make huge profits off of.\"",
    " Title: Democrats' Reactions to Trump's Policies Compared to Obama's Executive Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe article discusses the contrasting reactions of the Democratic party to the policies of President Donald Trump and his predecessor, President Barack Obama. The author argues that Democrats have shown a tendency to forget or downplay Obama's executive actions, particularly in areas such as immigration, foreign policy, and congressional subpoenas, while criticizing similar actions taken by President Trump.\n\nThe article cites examples of this phenomenon, such as the Democrats' criticism of Trump's immigration policies, which they claim are draconian, despite the fact that Obama deported more immigrants during his presidency. The article also mentions the construction of cages on the southern border, which the Democrats attribute to Trump, but were actually built during Obama's administration.\n\nIn terms of congressional subpoenas, the article points out that Obama's Attorney General, Eric Holder, was held in contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas, while Democrats have criticized Trump for doing the same. The article also mentions at least eight other instances of Obama's administration defying congressional oversight.\n\nThe article also compares the reactions of the two parties to the assassination of Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani. While Democrats have criticized Trump for authorizing the drone strike without their notification or consent, the article notes that Obama authorized at least 2,800 drone strikes in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that the Democrats' reactions to Trump's policies will likely cost them in the upcoming election, both in terms of foreign policy and the economy. The author also notes that the Democrats' reactions to Trump's actions are in stark contrast to their praise of Obama's policies in the past, such as the killing of Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe article does not express an opinion on the merits of the policies in question, but rather presents the contrasting reactions of the two parties as a phenomenon worth noting. The author does not take a side in the political debate, but rather presents the facts as they are.",
    " Title: Moms Demand Action Calls for Removal of Billboard Depicting Firearms as American Symbols\n\nArticle:\n\nMoms Demand Action for Gun Sense, a gun-control advocacy group funded by New York City billionaire Mike Bloomberg, has called for the removal of a billboard in several cities, including Chicago, that depicts \"assault rifles\" as being as American as apple pie and baseball. The ad, for firearms parts manufacturer Slide Fire, based in Texas, features the slogan \"Pure American\" under three photos of a baseball glove, a pie, and an AR-type rifle.\n\nNicole Chen, the head of the gun-control group's Illinois chapter, expressed her disapproval, stating, \"I was shocked that the ad removes'mom' from the idiom 'as American as baseball, apple pie, and mom,' and replaces it with an assault rifle.\" She added, \"It's particularly upsetting that children in Chicago, a city that has struggled horribly with gun violence, are being exposed to such a harmful message.\"\n\nSlide Fire deliberately chose Chicago for one of its billboards due to the city's high crime rate and extremely restrictive gun-control laws. Laura Shackelford, the chief executive manager of Slide Fire, explained, \"Chicago is the number one place in the country that shows gun laws don't work.\" She continued, \"We specifically put the ad up there to show that a firearm is normal Americana. We have to stop allowing a small group of anti-gun people to dictate how we think about guns.\"\n\nThe term \"assault rifle\" is often misused by anti-gun groups to describe any rifle with certain ergonomic features. In this context, the term refers to a fully automatic weapon that shoots ammunition as long as the trigger is pulled. However, the ad in question depicts a modern sporting rifle, which is not an \"assault rifle\" by definition.\n\nSlide Fire manufactures the Slide Stock, a replacement stock on a rifle that allows for faster shooting through a technique known as \"bump firing.\" The feature has been controversial due to claims that it converts a semi-automatic gun into an automatic one. However, the gun owner must still pull the trigger each time to release one round and use a complicated physical technique to shoot faster. The ATF has approved the feature for manufacture and sale.\n\nMs. Shackelford emphasized that the \"Pure American\" campaign is about promoting Second Amendment rights more than their product. She stated, \"We are all law-abiding citizens who are sick of being told that it's abnormal or scary to own a firearm. These gun-control groups are not making anyone safer, but just stoking irrational fears of the unknown.\"\n\nShe further pointed out that guns are older than either baseball or apple pies as symbols of America. \"Firearms are the reason we are American citizens today,\" she said. \"And it's why the Constitution includes the Second Amendment.\"\n\nLawrence Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents firearms manufacturers, also weighed in, stating, \"The modern sporting rifle depicted is by definition not an 'assault rifle.' We wish anti-gun groups wouldn't purposely mislead the public when they exercise their right to free speech.\"\n\nEmily Miller, senior editor of opinion for The \u2588\u2588\u2588 and author of \"Emily Gets Her Gun\" (Regnery, 2013), added her perspective on the matter.",
    " Title: Military Rights Group Calls for Removal of Nazi Symbols from German POW Graves in U.S. National Cemetery\n\nArticle:\n\nA nonprofit organization, the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF), has requested the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to remove marble headstones inscribed with Nazi iconography and a phrase honoring Adolf Hitler at the graves of two German prisoners of war (POWs) in the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery in San Antonio. The headstones bear the soldiers' names, dates of birth and death, a swastika within an iron cross - an award for valor - and the phrase, \"He died far from his home for the F\u00fchrer, people and fatherland.\"\n\nMikey Weinstein, chair of the MRFF, was informed about the headstones by a former active duty senior officer in the U.S. military. Weinstein, who is Jewish, shared photographs of the headstones with the media and wrote a letter to Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie, demanding that the department \"immediately replace the gravestones of all German military personnel interred in V.A. National Cemeteries\" and ensure that no Nazi-era symbols remain in U.S. military graveyards.\n\nThe Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, which houses 133,154 American veterans, spouses, or their children, has 140 POWs from World War II buried in its \"Section Z,\" with 132 being German. By the end of World War II, nearly half a million Axis prisoners of war were transferred to about 700 camps in the U.S., with the majority being repatriated at the end of the war. POWs who died in the U.S. were often buried at their prisons and reinterred in national cemeteries when camps shut down.\n\nIt is unclear why the remains of these two POWs, who died in 1943, were not repatriated nor why their gravestones were inscribed with Nazi iconography and given military distinction. The VA routinely changes out headstones if appropriately requested, such as for errors in spelling or dates. The military also keeps a registry of Available Emblems of Belief for Placement on Government Headstones and Markers, and neither the iron cross nor the swastika appear on the official list.\n\nThe former military officer who shared the photos, who is Jewish, saw the headstones when he was paying respects to his grandfather, an ambulance driver who fought against the Germans in World War II. His father was also enlisted, and his uncle and aunt are both buried at the same cemetery. \"There are Nazis here today, and they could gather around these symbols. You know, 'Here are the martyrs that died for our cause,'\" he told the media. \"It's an outrage.\"\n\nThe VA National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has stated that it will continue to preserve these headstones, like every past administration has. It is not immediately clear whether any past administration has fielded a similar call to remove the headstones. The VA did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHistorical records show that the POWs were buried in Section Z starting in 1947, according to a 2012 article about the cemetery in a local San Antonio publication. The cemetery is also home to four Italian, three Japanese, and one Austrian POWs. The remains of these POWs were buried in Section Z, which was as far from the active part of the cemetery as possible when they were first buried, but as the cemetery expanded, their graves are now in the geographic center.\n\nThe VA has not issued a statement regarding the removal of the headstones or an apology for their presence in the cemetery. The MRFF is now calling on the VA to apologize and explain why it has used taxpayer money to maintain the gravestones.",
    " Title: Millennials' Economic Struggles and the American Dream: A Look at Work, Investment, and Wealth\n\nArticle:\n\nRecent polling indicates a significant majority of Americans believe it will be more challenging for millennials to achieve the American Dream of economic advancement. This article examines the early indicators of young people's economic status and their financial habits.\n\nOne concerning trend is the declining labor force participation rate among individuals aged 18 to 24. The current rate is near a 50-year low, at 65 percent. This means that if you are 22 and not working, you are dependent, not independent. Moreover, over half of 18- to 23-year-olds live with their parents, leading to questions about when they might leave home.\n\nAnother troubling trend is the low rate of stock market participation among young people. According to the latest data from the Federal Reserve, only 7 percent of households headed by those under 35 years old directly own stock. This is a significant decrease compared to the 30 percent recorded in 1963 when the survey was first conducted.\n\nThe decline in stock market participation is not unique to the younger generation, as it has fallen for nearly every age group over the past decade. However, this is ironic given that since 2008, the stock market indexes have more than doubled. Many sold during the 2008 panic and have yet to re-enter the market.\n\nInvesting should be a long-term strategy for young people, as the dollar invested at a young age is likely to be worth significantly more after accounting for inflation by the time one reaches retirement age. The average real rate of return of stocks since the late-19th century has been 6 percent, which would make $1 invested at age 18 worth more than $15 at age 65. With a real return of 9 percent per year, each $1 grows to more than $50 during those 47 years.\n\nThere are several reasons for the low investment rates among young people. One reason is the lingering psychological trauma of the 2001 tech and 2008 broad market collapses. Another issue is the high levels of student loan debt, which leaves many young people unable to save and only able to pay off their debts.\n\nPerhaps the most significant problem for young workers is the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) payroll tax, which intercepts more than 12 percent of their paychecks. After paying these taxes, many young workers have little disposable income left to invest after covering necessities. Worse, the young do not receive a return on this money, as the government spends it as soon as it is received.\n\nEconomist Peter Ferrara of the Heartland Institute argues in his new book, \"Power to the People,\" that the average-income young American would have a nest egg of well over $1 million if they invested their payroll tax dollars in an index fund of all stocks. This would eliminate the retirement crisis for millennials and create a retirement bonanza instead.\n\nAccording to Ferrara, the average two-earner household earns about 1 percent per year on the FICA taxes they pay given the benefits they are scheduled to receive. A lifetime single worker, however, gets a significantly lower return of less than 0.5 percent. These workers would be nearly better off stashing their payroll tax dollars under a mattress.\n\nAmerica should aim to give every worker a piece of the economic pie and allow them to share in the returns to capital. The left's new narrative is that equity returns rise faster than wages. If this is true, it is essential to allow more poor and middle-class workers to own more equities.\n\nIf only the wealthiest top 10 percent of Americans own stock directly, the wealth gap between rich and poor is likely to widen. Economist David Malpass points out in a recent wealth analysis that the value of all U.S. household assets is $99 trillion, up more than 5 percent over the last year. However, he also finds that \"most of this wealth is concentrated with the wealthy,\" and this is in part because the middle class and young have dropped out of the market.\n\nIn conclusion, it is crucial for millennials to start investing early and regularly to build wealth and capital over time. The wise ones will get started immediately by setting aside $100 a month for investing in their and America's future.",
    " Title: Trump Transition Team Accuses Special Counsel of Unlawfully Obtaining Emails\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The organization responsible for U.S. President Donald Trump's transition to the White House, Trump for America, Inc. (TFA), has accused the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team of unlawfully obtaining tens of thousands of emails during the investigation into allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nIn a letter to congressional committees, Kory Langhofer, counsel to TFA, stated that career staff members at the General Services Administration (GSA), a government agency, had unlawfully produced TFA's private materials, including privileged communications, to Mueller's office.\n\nThe materials, according to the letter, included \"tens of thousands of emails.\" The Trump team used facilities of the GSA, which helps manage the U.S. government bureaucracy, during the period between Trump's November presidential election victory and his inauguration in January.\n\nThe Trump team's accusation adds to the growing friction between the president's supporters and Mueller's office as it investigates whether Russia interfered in the election and if Trump or anyone on his team colluded with Moscow.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, \"We continue to cooperate fully with the special counsel and expect this process to wrap up soon.\"\n\nThe special counsel's office dismissed the transition team's complaint. \"When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner's consent or appropriate criminal process,\" said Peter Carr, spokesman for the special counsel's office.\n\nThe GSA did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nDemocrats say there is a wide-ranging effort by the president's allies on Capitol Hill and in some media outlets to discredit Mueller's investigation. Trump himself has declared Mueller's effort a waste of time, stating, \"There is absolutely no collusion. That has been proven.\"\n\nOn Friday, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, expressed concerns that the committee's Republican majority intends to prematurely close its investigation of the topic. Some Republicans have argued that Mueller is biased against Trump and should be fired.\n\nLanghofer's letter was sent to the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. It asked Congress to act immediately \"to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives.\"\n\nThe letter stated that Mueller's office obtained the emails despite the fact that it was aware the GSA did not own or control the records. It also said the special counsel's office has \"extensively used the materials in question, including portions that are susceptible to claims of privilege\" without notifying the Trump for America team.\n\nThe transition team included a number of aides who were later caught up in Mueller's investigation, such as former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty this month to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia.\n\nLanghofer, the Trump transition team lawyer, wrote in his letter that the GSA's transfer of materials was discovered on Dec. 12 and 13. The FBI had requested the materials from GSA staff on Aug. 23, asking for copies of the emails, laptops, cell phones, and other materials associated with nine members of the Trump transition team responsible for national security and policy matters, the letter said. The FBI requested materials of four additional senior members of the Trump transition team on Aug. 30, it added.\n\nLanghofer argued that, while such transition teams are involved in executive functions, they are considered private, non-profit organizations whose records are private and not subject to presidential records laws.",
    " Title: Nevada and Idaho Halt Same-sex Marriage Licenses Amid Conflicting Court Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nCounty clerks in Nevada and Idaho declined to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples on Wednesday, following a series of conflicting court decisions. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling temporarily blocked partners in Idaho from obtaining marriage licenses, while a 9th Circuit Court ruling cleared the way for Idaho and Nevada to issue such licenses. However, a stay by Justice Anthony Kennedy halted the process in both states.\n\nIn Nevada, couples gathered at courthouses early in anticipation of receiving marriage licenses, but were ultimately turned away. Mary Baranovich, a plaintiff in a Nevada court challenge to the state's gay marriage ban, expressed disappointment, stating, \"I think I have whiplash.\"\n\nIn Idaho, hopeful couples also gathered at courthouses, but were informed that they would not be issuing same-sex marriage licenses that day.

Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, stood with his wife R. Jai and thanked his supporters.\n\n\"R. Jai and I wanted to take a moment to congratulate Mr. DeSantis on becoming the next governor of the great state of Florida,\" Gillum said.\n\nThe race went to a legally required recount, but after an initial machine recount, DeSantis still led Gillum by more than 30,000 votes. More than 8 million ballots went to a machine recount that ended Thursday afternoon. The final tally was 4,075,445 for DeSantis and 4,041,762 for Gillum.\n\nGillum said he and his wife wanted to ensure every vote had been counted, including those that were undervotes and overvotes.\n\n\"We wanted to make sure that every vote, including those that were undervotes and overvotes\u2014as long as it was a legally cast vote\u2014we wanted those votes to be counted,\" he said.\n\nLosing the race for the governor's mansion does not mean Gillum will stop working on behalf of Florida voters. He will end his four-year term as Tallahassee mayor later this month but said he would fight to update the state election system and advocate for the issues that matter to him and the more than 4 million people who voted for him.\n\n\"We also want you to know that even though this election may be beyond us, that this\u2014although nobody wanted to be governor more than me\u2014this was not just about an election cycle,\" he said. \"This was about creating the kind of change in this state that really allows for the voices of everyday people to show up again in our government, our state, and our communities.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump offered praise on Twitter for Gillum, whom he had frequently attacked leading up to Election Day.\n\n\"Congratulations to Andrew Gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for Governor of the Great State of Florida,\" Trump tweeted. \"He will be a strong Democrat warrior long into the future\u2014a force to reckon with!\"\n\nGillum said he has no plans of stepping out of the spotlight completely.\n\n\"Stay tuned.

The video's narrator warns, \"Just when you thought it was safe to go to the doctor, a rising tide of health care costs.\"\n\nCrossroads GPS, one of the largest conservative political groups, has been known for its aggressive approach to political issues, including immigration reform and student loans. The organization spent $176 million in the 2012 federal elections, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans in the House of Representatives have also been actively criticizing Obamacare, passing two bills on Wednesday night that aim to postpone the individual and business mandates of the Affordable Care Act. However, these bills are not expected to progress in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nThe release of the \"ObamaCareNado\" video coincides with President Obama's Thursday morning speech, where he highlighted the success of the Affordable Care Act. He stated, \"Affordable health care is not some privilege just for the few. It's a basic right that everybody should be able to enjoy so we're going to keep fighting to secure that right to make sure that every American gets the care that they need when they need it at a price they can afford.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a study was released predicting a 50% drop in health care prices for New York residents when the health care law takes effect next year.",
    " Title: \"Public Response to Jesse Jackson Jr.'s Corruption Case Mixed: Morning Joe Expresses Sorrow, Sparking Debate\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe fallout from the corruption case involving former Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. has sparked a debate, with some expressing sympathy and others condemnation. In a segment on the political talk show 'Morning Joe,' the hosts expressed sadness over Jackson Jr.'s downfall, a sentiment that has been met with criticism from some observers.\n\nJazz Shaw, a political commentator, summarized the criticism in a post on his website:\n\n\"At what point did this become a'sad story' exactly?\" Shaw wrote. \"The criminal was caught and brought to justice. The system worked. Aren't we generally happy about that?\"\n\nJackson Jr. was found guilty of misusing over $750,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses, including luxury items such as a $43,000 Rolex watch. The former congressman represented a district with a significant number of residents living below the poverty level.\n\nShaw continued, \"This guy stole nearly a million dollars from the people of his district. Was anybody'sad' when Bernie Madoff got caught? Was anyone praying for 'a new chapter' in Madoff's life where he would 'turn things around?'\"\n\nThe hosts of 'Morning Joe' argued that Jackson Jr. deserved sympathy due to his struggles with bipolar disorder and the impact his conviction would have on his family. However, Shaw and others argue that Jackson Jr.'s actions were a betrayal of the public trust and that Americans should be celebrating his conviction, not lamenting his downfall.\n\nAlexander Hamilton, in The Federalist Papers, wrote that \"a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the forbidding appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government.\" In other words, corrupt politicians like Jesse Jackson Jr. will always exist in public life, and it is the responsibility of citizens to hold them accountable.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Jackson Jr.'s case highlights the ongoing challenge of maintaining trust in government and the importance of holding elected officials accountable for their actions.",
    " Title: North Carolina Primary Highlights Establishment vs. Tea Party, American Idol Runner-up's Bid, and Other Key Races\n\nArticle:\n\nThe primary season is in full swing as North Carolina, Ohio, and Indiana hold primaries today. Twenty-five states will hold primaries in the next six weeks, with today's key race taking place in North Carolina, where the establishment GOP and the Tea Party are engaged in a fierce battle. This contest is seen as a potential 2016 proxy fight between Jeb Bush, Rand Paul, and Mike Huckabee.\n\nSeveral colorful candidates are on the ballot today. In North Carolina, the Republican Senate primary pits Thom Tillis, the establishment candidate backed by Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, against Greg Brannon, a Tea Party and libertarian favorite. Mark Harris, an Evangelical candidate who has galvanized social conservatives, is also in the race, having been backed by Mike Huckabee. Candidates must receive 40 percent of the vote to avoid a July 15 run-off. Polls show Tillis leading with Brannon in second, but with Tillis just barely clearing the 40 percent mark.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, American Idol 2003 runner-up Clay Aiken is facing off against businessman Keith Crisco and Toni Morris. There has been no public polling in this race, making it difficult to predict the outcome. Aiken has been outspent by Crisco and has run only one television ad compared to Crisco's four.\n\nIn the 3rd Congressional District of North Carolina, Rep. Walter Jones is being challenged from the right by GOP consultant and former aide to President George W. Bush and the McCain campaign, Taylor Griffin. Jones is well known for voting for the Iraq war and becoming one of the most vocal members of the GOP against it. Griffin is seen as more conservative than Jones due to his foreign policy views, while Jones has tried to portray Griffin as a \"Washington insider.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner is facing two challengers, despite being heavily favored to win. He is facing Eric Gurr, a computer consultant, and J.D. Winteregg, a high school French teacher. Boehner will win, but he is facing challengers and some outside money being thrown at him. Winteregg has gained publicity for himself by releasing an online parody video in the style of the drug Cialis. The video was a not-so-subtle spin on the speaker's first name and claimed Winteregg offers the remedy for \"electile dysfunction\" personified by Boehner. Winteregg was dismissed from an adjunct teaching position at Cedarville University, a Christian college, after the suggestive video aired. The Tea Party Leadership Fund has spent about $325,000 on behalf of Winteregg and against Boehner.\n\nIn Indiana, there are no exciting races this time around, as neither of the state's senators are on the ballot, and all nine House incumbents are seeking re-election, making it a relatively uneventful primary.\n\nToday's primary election in North Carolina will be the first time voters go to the polls since the state's new voting law was passed in August by the state's GOP governor and legislature. Today may not prove to be a true test of the law because turnout is usually low in primary contests and the highest-profile requirement of the new law, having to show government-issued ID at the polls, does not go into effect until 2016. However, voting rights advocates will still be keeping an eye on some of the law's provisions, such as a ban on same-day registration and restrictions on early voting.",
    " Title: Media's Decline: A Look at the Shift in Information Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nThe current media landscape is experiencing a significant shift, as traditional media outlets are facing a decline in relevance and influence. This change is attributed to two primary factors: the growing public disillusionment with the media elite and the advent of technology that allows individuals to bypass traditional media gatekeepers.\n\nThe disillusionment stems from the public's perception of media outlets as biased and unreliable. Many individuals feel that traditional media outlets have been lying to them and distorting the news, leading to a loss of trust and a desire for alternative sources of information.\n\nThe technology revolution has provided an avenue for bypassing traditional media outlets. Social media platforms, online news sources, and other digital mediums have emerged as viable alternatives, offering unfiltered news and information directly to the public. This shift has led to a decline in the influence and power of traditional media outlets, as they are increasingly being ignored by the public.\n\nThe decline in relevance is particularly evident in the case of Donald Trump. Despite the media's efforts to discredit him, Trump remains popular, and his opponents, including Hillary Clinton, have not been able to match his appeal. This has led to a sense of frustration and desperation among media outlets, as they struggle to maintain their influence and control the narrative.\n\nTraditional media outlets have also been criticized for their lack of objectivity. In the past, they claimed to be impartial, but many individuals feel that they have abandoned this pretense in favor of promoting their own ideologies. This shift has further eroded public trust in traditional media outlets, as they are seen as biased and unreliable.\n\nThe decline in the influence and power of traditional media outlets is a significant shift in the information landscape. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that this trend will continue, with individuals increasingly turning to alternative sources of information and bypassing traditional media gatekeepers. This shift has far-reaching implications for the future of journalism and the role of media in society.",
    " Title: The Impact of Election Outcomes on Policy Agenda: A Look at the 1964 and 2016 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nA divide among some American progressive groups, particularly those associated with labor unions and economic populism, is growing as the 2016 presidential election approaches. The concern is that Donald Trump, due to his perceived vulnerabilities, may prompt Hillary Clinton to run a campaign that focuses primarily on policy matters minimally, instead opting for a landslide victory that would carry no mandate.\n\nConversely, David Frum, a center-right Republican dissident writing in The Atlantic, expresses a contrasting worry. He suggests that Clinton faces a challenge similar to neither Johnson nor Nixon in 1964 or 1972, the challenge of a divided party that may push her to lean left to retain the support of Bernie Sanders' supporters.\n\nFrum cites Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 convention speech as an example of the rhetoric Clinton should, but likely cannot, employ. Johnson's speech emphasized the Democratic Party as a unifying force for all Americans, eschewing partisan politics and prejudice.\n\nThe 1964 election, however, demonstrates that this choice may be a false one. Johnson attempted to run a campaign focused on portraying his opponent, Barry Goldwater, as an unacceptable outlier, but the election resulted in a landslide victory for Johnson and historic majorities for the Democrats in the House and Senate. This, in turn, led to a burst of progressive legislation in 1965-'66 that is considered one of the biggest legislative leaps forward in American history.\n\nThe reality is that the amount of progressive legislation a candidate can enact is largely dependent on the shape of Congress rather than the content of their platform. Clinton does not have a realistic chance of securing large Democratic majorities. The House districts are heavily tilted, making a narrow majority a steep uphill fight, and any Democratic majority would rely heavily on relatively moderate members holding Republican-leaning districts.\n\nEven a small Democratic majority reliant on moderate legislators would pass more progressive legislation, such as raising the minimum wage, increasing taxes, and expanding Medicaid funding, than a Republican majority. The success of Democrats in securing such a majority will be a significant factor in determining policy outcomes, rather than whatever liberal causes Clinton may pay lip service to.\n\nThe shape of House districts, therefore, suggests that Democrats' hopes of securing such a majority depend on either swinging Republicans over to their side or else demoralizing Republicans and getting them to stay home altogether. This, in turn, reinforces the pattern established by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964: The choice between reassuring the center and laying the groundwork for policy on issues is a false one.",
    " Title: House Republican Leaders Unveil Tax-Increase Proposal, Drawing Mixed Reactions from Conservatives\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that breaks with traditional Republican orthodoxy, House Republican leaders have proposed a deficit reduction package that includes increased taxes for wealthier Americans as part of an effort to avoid the fiscal cliff. The proposal, which is part of a $2.2 trillion deficit reduction package, has drawn criticism from some conservative lawmakers, but top Senate Republicans have been cautious in their response.\n\nThe tax-increase proposal aims to raise new revenue by eliminating unspecified deductions and other loopholes from the tax code. While it does not call for an increase in tax rates, it has been met with criticism from conservatives like Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina), who described it as an $800 billion tax hike that would destroy jobs and allow for more spending in Washington. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) also voiced opposition, stating that raising taxes would \"cripple the economy.\"\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) declined to endorse the plan directly when asked about it at a press conference, instead commending the House Republican leadership for moving the process along and expressing hope that a real discussion could take place. Sen. John Thune (R-South Dakota) and Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Missouri) also expressed support for the plan as a good faith effort that should be taken seriously by the White House.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), a senior Republican on the Finance Committee, was one of the few GOP senators who expressed support for the plan, but only if there is a \"willingness on the part of Democrats to accept spending cuts that are three to one or four to one.\"\n\nConservative groups like Americans for Prosperity and Heritage Action for America have also criticized the plan, with the latter urging supporters to contact their members of Congress and oppose the compromise.\n\nHouse Republican aides argue that the criticism from the right demonstrates that the proposal is a serious and credible offer, and that the president is not meeting the same level of criticism because he is proposing a \"Christmas list for the left.\" The aides also believe that if the White House does not show movement, it indicates that the president agrees with liberals that going off the fiscal cliff is not a significant concern.\n\nThe entire House GOP leadership team, including House Speaker John Boehner and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, signed onto the Republican counter offer on Monday. Freshman Georgia Republican Rep. Austin Scott praised the show of unity and expressed a desire to see a deal that reduces the debt more, but still needs to see the final cost of the House Republican plan.\n\nDespite the criticism from some conservatives, House GOP aides recognize that they are likely to lose votes from conservatives if they are able to reach a final deal with the White House, but are working closely to keep their message consistent. They are also pressing the administration to engage and show what kind of cuts to entitlement programs Obama could accept.",
    " Title: Former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee Ends Long-Shot Presidential Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee, a Democrat, announced the end of his presidential bid on Friday at the Democratic National Committee Women's Leadership Forum. Chafee, who was a Republican, independent, and then a Democrat, is the second candidate to withdraw from the race this week, following former Virginia Senator Jim Webb's announcement on Tuesday.\n\nChafee, a member of a prominent political family in Rhode Island, had struggled to make any significant impact in the race. He raised only $8,300 from 10 major donors during the last quarter, and his few supporters told NPR this week they appreciated the positive attitude he brought to the race.\n\nChafee's performance in last week's presidential debate was unremarkable, speaking for just nine minutes during the two-hour faceoff. He emphasized his anti-war stance, contrasting it with front-runner Hillary Clinton's controversial 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq War.\n\nIn his withdrawal announcement, Chafee reiterated his peace-focused platform, stating, \"The United States of America is so strong militarily, economically, and culturally that we can take chances for peace. In fact, as a strong mature world leader, we must take chances for peace.\"\n\nChafee's campaign had been marked by several missteps, including his response to a question about his vote to repeal banking regulations known as the Glass-Steagall Act, which many saw as evidence of his unpreparedness. His sparsely attended announcement in June, during which he advocated for the U.S. to switch to the metric system, was also widely panned.\n\nBefore entering politics, Chafee had an interesting life. He attended an exclusive Northeastern prep school, where he was a classmate of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. After graduating from Brown University, he went on to learn to be a farrier, someone who shoes horses, and traveled around the U.S. working at racetracks.",
    " Title: New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte Defends Vote Against Expanded Background Checks, Faces Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, has come under fire for voting against a bill aimed at expanding background checks on gun purchases. In response, Ayotte published an op-ed on Monday to clarify her stance on the issue.\n\nIn the op-ed, Ayotte stated that outside groups are running false advertisements against her, accusing her of not supporting measures to prevent gun-related violence. Ayotte affirmed her support for effective background checks, citing her recent vote to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).\n\nThe controversy stems from Ayotte's vote against a compromise bill proposed by Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). This proposal would have mandated background checks for sales at gun shows and online transactions. Instead, Ayotte supported an alternative measure, written by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), which focused on encouraging states to submit mental health information to the background check database, without addressing gun shows and online sales.\n\nAyotte's poll numbers have dropped, and she has faced criticism from various groups, including Michael Bloomberg's Mayors Against Illegal Guns and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' Americans for Responsible Solutions, who have run ads in New Hampshire attacking her. The daughter of the principal at Sandy Hook Elementary School also confronted Ayotte at a town hall, an incident that garnered national media attention.\n\nIn response to Ayotte's op-ed, John Feinblatt, Chairman of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, stated, \"In her op-ed, Senator Ayotte says that she voted to improve the existing background check system, but the bill she voted for (Grassley-Cruz) did just the opposite by narrowing the categories of mentally ill people who would be prohibited gun purchasers and potentially calling into question millions of names already in the system.\" Feinblatt further noted that the current background check system has blocked over two million dangerous people from buying guns.",
    " Title: Emory University Hospital's Ebola Treatment: A 12-Year Preparation and a 3-Month Response\n\nArticle:\n\nAtlanta's Emory University Hospital received the first call at the end of July, reporting an American doctor who had contracted Ebola while treating patients in Liberia. In just 72 hours, Dr. Kent Brantly would be admitted to Emory's doors, and almost immediately, the hospital learned that a second Ebola patient was also on the way.\n\nThe true cure for the Ebola virus is keeping the patient alive long enough to develop the antibodies that will help them recover from the infection. In the three months since, Emory has treated four Ebola patients, all of whom have survived. The most recent patient, Dallas nurse Amber Vinson, spent more than a week in a special treatment unit at Emory before being discharged in good health and spirits on Tuesday.\n\nDr. Bruce Ribner, who heads Emory's Ebola team, told reporters at a news conference Tuesday that the general dogma in the industry in July was that if patients became severely ill and required dialysis or ventilator support, such interventions would be ineffective, as the patients would invariably die. Emory, however, proved that aggressive treatment of the illness can be effective.\n\nEmory's plan to treat patients with infectious diseases like Ebola began 12 years ago, when the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started working with the hospital to create a special isolation unit. Since then, a core team of health workers has trained yearly and held practice drills every six months to stay prepared for any infectious disease that may come their way.\n\nIn July, with two Ebola patients on the way, it quickly became clear that Emory's specially trained team was too small, says Nancye Feistritzer, the hospital's chief of nursing. Critical care nurses volunteered to help fill in the gaps but were not part of the core group that had long practiced for this day. The expanded team had to quickly train, and not everyone made the cut.\n\nOnce all the team members were in place, they focused on supportive care of these patients, administering IV fluids and preventing infections. \"The true cure for Ebola virus is keeping the patient alive long enough to develop the antibodies that will cause them to get over the infection,\" Dr. Jay Varkey says.\n\nEmory learned lessons, big and small, from each case. For example, increasing the amount of working space around patients sick with Ebola helped a lot, as did having a hand sanitizer dispenser available that wouldn't require a gloved hand to be touched. In Emory's experience, nurses on the Ebola unit, who started out on eight-hour shifts, preferred 12-hour rotations instead. Caring for the emotional health of patients in isolation is as important as promoting physical well-being, the staff learned.\n\nTeam members worked hard to coordinate their efforts, from top administrators to waste management crews, to pharmacists and lab technicians\u2014every department played a role. \"Every morning the team meets to discuss what worked well, what might be refined,\" Feistritzer says, looking for lessons that might be put into practice the next shift or the next day.\n\nThe Emory team does not claim to have all the right answers, Varkey says. But what they do know, they're sharing. \"Our entire 84-page document, in terms of our protocols,\" he says, \"is now available to any person who wants to access that on the Web.\" Those protocols went live a week ago. So far, more than 11,300 people have registered to get access to them.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership between NPR, WABE, and Kaiser Health News.",
    " Title: Houston Struggles with Looting, Curfew as Tropical Storm Harvey Causes Mass Evacuation and Billions in Damage\n\nArticle:\n\nHouston, the fourth-largest city in the United States, is grappling with the aftermath of Tropical Storm Harvey, which made landfall near Corpus Christi on Friday. The storm, the most powerful to hit Texas in over 50 years, has resulted in at least 25 deaths, forced 30,000 people to seek shelter, and caused an estimated tens of billions of dollars in damage.\n\nIn response to the crisis, the Houston City Council has allocated $20 million from a rainy day fund for storm recovery efforts. However, officials anticipate that far more resources will be needed. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has suggested that the state may require federal relief totaling over $125 billion, surpassing the aid provided to Hurricane Katrina victims in 2005.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, close to 49,000 homes in Texas have suffered flood damage, with over 1,000 destroyed. Thousands of other homes are threatened by two reservoirs swollen by as much as 52 inches (132 cm) of rain in some areas. Officials have ordered evacuations in several areas around levees or dams, but opted against calling for a mass evacuation to avoid potential chaos during the storm.\n\nLooting and armed robberies have been reported in Houston, prompting a midnight to 5 a.m. curfew. At least 40 people have been arrested for looting, including one individual who allegedly drove a sport utility vehicle into a cash machine. Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg has vowed to vigorously prosecute looters.\n\nThe George R. Brown Convention Center, which initially planned to house 5,000 people, has seen its population double due to the influx of evacuees from areas south and west of Houston. At least one man was arrested in the convention center for attempting to steal a cot and insulting police officers.\n\nTwo additional \"mega\" centers, the Toyota Center and NRG Park, were opened late Tuesday to accommodate more evacuees. As of Wednesday afternoon, about 8,000 people were taking shelter at the Houston convention center, with the population fluctuating as other centers open and some evacuees move on.\n\nA long-term solution for the evacuees has yet to be formulated. \"Right now we're just working in 12-hour increments,\" said Tom McCasland, director of Houston's housing and community development department and head of the convention center shelter.\n\nSome have criticized the decision not to order a mass evacuation, but officials noted that a 2005 evacuation ahead of Hurricane Rita turned into a nightmare for many in Texas and Louisiana who became trapped in vehicles that ran out of fuel on congested roadways.\n\nArea churches and aid organizations have donated clothing, bedding, and food for the evacuees. The Red Cross has brought at least 1,000 volunteers to staff the convention center and provided cots, blankets, and food for 34,000 across the region.\n\nHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner has called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to send cots, food, and other supplies, as well as to deploy staff directly into damaged communities, not just into shelters. \"I can't think of one district where there are not tremendous needs,\" said Turner. \"People are looking for results.\"",

Rubio's tax returns, dating back to 2000, show his family's adjusted gross income was $335,561 in 2014, with a 19.3% tax rate. Cruz released 2010-2014 tax returns, reporting an adjusted gross income of $1.2 million in 2014, with a 32.22% tax rate.\n\nRubio's tax returns, available on his campaign website, indicate a significant increase in income from previous years. In 2012, the Rubios reported nearly $1 million in income. In 2000, their largest monthly expense was a payment to Sallie Mae, and they paid bills by mail, hoping payments wouldn't arrive before the next paycheck. Today, their only debt is their mortgage on their house.\n\nCruz, who previously released 2006-2010 tax returns during his Senate campaign, called for Trump to release his returns, stating, \"It is time to stop the excuses.\" Cruz's statement continued, \"Donald Trump owes it to the American people to be fully vetted, and that includes releasing his tax returns so the voters can see the full financial picture.\"\n\nTrump faced criticism at Thursday's debate for not releasing his tax returns. When asked about the issue, Trump responded, \"I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously.\"\n\nAn NPR fact check found that there is no law barring Trump from releasing his returns while being audited, though an accountant or lawyer may have advised him otherwise. The information regarding Trump's tax returns and any potential advice from his accountant or lawyer was not available in the provided source text.",
    " Title: The Impact of Automation on American Jobs and Education\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate about economic recovery in the United States has led to growing frustration among Americans, with good-paying jobs remaining scarce and family incomes down by approximately $1,650 during President Obama's tenure. This trend has been compared to the economic recovery periods under former presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, where the annual growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 4.6 and 3.7 percent, respectively, compared to the current 2.2 percent under President Obama.\n\nHowever, the article suggests that the lack of workers adequately trained for a more technologically demanding workplace is slowing growth, not the other way around. The article argues that automation has been a persistent theme throughout American history, with machines replacing workers in various industries, pushing them into more highly paid professions or less well-paid occupations.\n\nThe article points to the increasing role of robots in the workforce, with machines taking over tasks requiring subtle manual dexterity and complex cognitive processes. By 2030, it is predicted that 90 percent of jobs could be replaced by smart machines. The real challenge, according to the article, is training most Americans to engage in intellectually demanding and creative work, or risk being relegated to low-paying jobs better suited for androids.\n\nThe article also criticizes the state of education in the United States, with less than 40 percent of 12th graders being ready for college-level reading and math, and four in ten college graduates lacking the complex reasoning skills needed for white-collar work. The article suggests that the focus on sexism in education and the workplace, as well as the opposition to universal standards for more academic rigor like the Common Core, is misguided and detrimental to the future prosperity of the country.\n\nThe article is written by Peter Morici, an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist. The article calls for a shift in focus from anger about false injustice or an omnipresent state to building and teaching the machines that will do the work that has burdened humanity since the first branch was shaped into a hunting implement. The article concludes by warning that without young people trained and encouraged to do sophisticated work, the locus of prosperity will permanently shift from America to Asia.",
    " Title: Senate Leaders Prepare for Showdown Over Presidential Nominations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a developing political standoff, the top Democrat in the Senate, Harry Reid, has vowed to proceed with a series of votes this week that could potentially alter Senate rules to expedite the confirmation of President Obama's executive branch and independent agency nominees. This move, known as the \"nuclear option,\" could end the bipartisan cooperation that is crucial to the Senate's operations.\n\nSen. Reid aims to amend the rules to prevent Republicans from filibustering when President Obama nominates individuals for executive branch or independent agency positions, while maintaining the filibuster for judicial nominees. In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Sen. Reid defended the proposed rule change, stating, \"The changes we're making are very, very minimal. What we're doing is saying, 'Look, shouldn't President Obama have someone working for him that he wants?'\"\n\nUnder this scenario, Sen. Reid would leverage the Democrats' majority in the Senate to overturn decades of precedent, effectively changing the rules when it comes to parliamentary procedure. This would establish that nonjudicial nominees are not subject to the same level of debate as bills.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, countered that Democrats are seeking a fight where there is none. He argued that Senate Republicans have confirmed President Obama's picks at a faster rate than President George W. Bush's at the same point during his term, and that Republicans have not defeated any of the president's major executive nominees.\n\nThe tension between the two leaders is palpable, as they did not appear together during their interviews on NBC. Sen. Reid has scheduled seven potential filibuster votes for Tuesday morning, including nominations for the Labor Department secretary, Environmental Protection Agency administrator, three members of the National Labor Relations Board, president of the Export-Import Bank, and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe question remains whether Sen. Reid would force a rules change if Republicans filibuster only some of these nominees. He has scheduled the three most controversial votes\u2014for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and two of the NLRB picks\u2014to be first, suggesting he is trying to pressure Republicans to relent.\n\nSen. McConnell stated that Republicans would allow most of the nominees, including those to whom they strongly object, such as Thomas E. Perez, the Labor secretary pick. However, the three main fights over the NLRB and CFPB nominees are more complex. When these nominees faced potential Republican blockades early last year, President Obama used his recess appointment powers to name them to their positions, but he did so at a time when the Senate did not consider itself in recess.\n\nA federal appeals court has ruled that President Obama exceeded his authority with the NLRB appointment and invalidated one of the board's rulings, calling the rest into question. The Supreme Court is set to take up the case. Republicans argue that Sen. Reid is risking significant damage to the Senate institution in an attempt to save the NLRB from its precarious position.\n\nAhead of the showdown, each side has presented numbers to support their arguments. Republicans claim they have confirmed an exceptional number of President Obama's nominees, including every executive branch appointment that has reached the Senate floor. They assert that they have obstructed only a few judges who were outside of mainstream legal thought.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, argue that Republicans have used nominations as a means to attack President Obama's policies and the role of government. Sen. Reid stated, \"They have nothing against the qualifications. They don't like the jobs these people have.\"\n\nThe filibuster is not part of Senate rules. It is a term applied when a single senator or group of senators wishes to prolong debate on an issue indefinitely. Some issues and motions, such as bringing a budget to the Senate floor, are considered nondebatable and cannot be filibustered, but most regular motions are debatable. It takes 60 votes to end debate, and a failed vote to cut off debate is considered a filibuster.",
    " Title: White House Faces Controversies in Second Term, but Agenda Remains Focus\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is currently embroiled in several controversies, with some comparing the situation to previous presidents' scandals during their second terms. The past week has seen headlines of potential scandals, including the secret subpoena of journalists' phone records, the IRS targeting of conservative groups, misleading statements about the Benghazi terrorist attack, and others.\n\nHowever, a rocky start to a second term does not necessarily mean the derailment of a president's goals or agenda. According to Howard Kurtz, the host of CNN's \"Reliable Sources,\" presidents such as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton signed major fiscal legislation during their lame-duck terms.\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney insisted Tuesday that the controversies have little connection to President Barack Obama's second-term agenda. He stated that the president is focused on issues such as economic growth, expanded opportunities for the middle class, and immigration reform, as per the campaign promises made during his re-election last November.\n\nOne of the controversies in question is the secret subpoena of AP phone records. The Republican National Committee has called for Obama to demand Attorney General Eric Holder's resignation over the matter. If not, said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, it will show that \"the president of the United States believes his administration is above the Constitution and does not respect the role of a free press.\"\n\nAnother issue is the IRS political targeting, with Republican senators characterizing it as a broad abuse of power by the administration. The embattled Holder, who was cited for contempt of Congress during Obama's first term over the botched \"Fast and Furious\" gun walking program, also confirmed that he recused himself last year from his department's investigation of classified leaks that led to the recent secret subpoenas of telephone logs of The Associated Press.\n\nThe Benghazi issue has renewed GOP criticism of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, considered the likely Democratic frontrunner if she decides to run for president in 2016. The GOP accuses the administration of not bolstering security prior to the attack, of botching the response to it, and of misleading the public in its slow-to-evolve explanation of events less than two months before the November election.\n\nDespite these controversies, the full details remain unknown, and they are certain to continue to dominate Washington in coming days. Carney spoke as Attorney General Eric Holder announced a Justice Department investigation of whether any laws were broken in the IRS political targeting. Congress is also looking into the matter, with a House committee hearing scheduled for Friday.",
    " Title: House Passes Clean Debt Ceiling Bill, Relying on Democratic Support\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 221-201 vote, the House of Representatives has passed a bill to lift the debt ceiling until March 2015, removing the threat of a default until after the November midterm election. The bill was supported by 193 Democrats and just 28 Republicans.\n\nThe bill's passage marks a reversal for Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who, in 2011, stated that when Congress raises the debt limit, it should also enact budget cuts of equal or greater magnitude. The vote also signifies the House Republican Conference's inability to move beyond fiscal fights and highlights the leadership's inability or unwillingness to corral votes for their priorities.\n\nAll Republican leadership, including Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), voted for the bill. Other notable Republican supporters include Reps. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Peter King (R-N.Y.), Buck McKeon (R-Calif.), Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), and Peter Roskam (R-Ill.).\n\nHowever, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), a potential 2016 presidential candidate, voted against the bill. House Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), GOP Policy Chairman James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), the chairman of the party's political arm, also voted against the bill.\n\nThe Senate could vote on the debt limit bill as early as Wednesday. Once the Senate clears the bill, Congress will not face a major fiscal decision until government funding runs dry on September 30.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney called the House vote a \"positive step in moving away from political brinkmanship.\"\n\nTuesday's vote was the culmination of a series of fits and starts over the last few weeks. Republicans considered attaching various policy provisions to the debt limit increase, such as changes to Obamacare, the Keystone XL pipeline, updates to the Medicare reimbursement rate, and reversals to recent military pension cuts. However, each time leadership floated a new policy, the rank and file rejected it.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Boehner announced during a meeting at the Capitol Hill Club that he would seek to pass a clean debt limit increase. Boehner denied that it was a result of having less leverage after the October 2013 government shutdown.\n\n\"No, it's the fact that we don't have 218 votes,\" Boehner said. \"And when you don't have 218 votes, you have nothing. We've seen that before, we see it again.\"\n\nThere was rancor within the rank and file and in leadership, where many wanted to dispense with the issue, especially since the GOP is gaining political momentum due to troubles with Obamacare. However, outside conservative groups, including the Club for Growth, called on Republicans to oppose the bill.\n\nBoehner blamed President Barack Obama for the divisions within the House Republican Conference.\n\n\"You've all known that our members are not crazy about voting to increase the debt ceiling,\" Boehner said Tuesday morning. \"Our members are also very upset with the president. He won't negotiate. He won't deal with our long-term spending problems without us raising taxes. He won't even sit down and discuss these issues. He's the one driving up the debt, and the question they're asking is, why should I deal with his debt limit?\"",
    " Title: U.S.-Germany Tensions Escalate over Alleged Surveillance of World Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions between the United States government and its allies, including Germany, have escalated following reports that the National Security Agency (NSA) may have monitored the phone calls of 35 world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The latest report in The Guardian suggests a secret memo reveals that the NSA encouraged top departments to share their contact lists to keep numbers for top foreign leaders in their surveillance systems. The document reportedly states that an official handed over 200 numbers, some of which covered 35 world leaders, though their identities remain unnamed.\n\nGermany's government has already expressed outrage over the allegations that Merkel's cellphone may have been targeted. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, while stating that the U.S. \"is not monitoring and will not monitor\" Merkel's communications, did not deny that such surveillance may have occurred in the past.\n\nOn Thursday, the German Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador John B. Emerson for a meeting with Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. In a written statement, Westerwelle said he told the ambassador \"it is unacceptable that the mobile phone of our Federal Chancellor may have been subject to surveillance activities by our American partners.\"\n\n\"For us, spying on close friends and partners is totally unacceptable. This undermines trust, and this can harm our friendship,\" the foreign minister said. \"We need the truth now.\"\n\nThe latest incident is the latest in a series of flare-ups over reported surveillance that has involved France, Mexico, and Brazil. More damaging information could be on the horizon, as The Washington Post reported Friday that U.S. officials are telling some foreign intelligence agencies that NSA leaker Edward Snowden has documents detailing their cooperation with the United States.\n\nFrance demanded explanations over a report that the U.S. swept up millions of French phone records and also summoned the American ambassador to demand an explanation. Germany, which has Europe's biggest economy, has been one of Washington's closest allies in Europe. The United States was West Germany's protector during the Cold War, and the country is still home to thousands of U.S. troops.\n\nCarney said Wednesday that President Obama assured Merkel that \"the United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the chancellor.\" The German government did not comment on Merkel's response to Obama's statement, but a prominent lawmaker with her party who heads Parliament's domestic affairs committee criticized Carney's statement.\n\n\"I think we are all outraged, across party lines,\" Wolfgang Bosbach told Deutschlandfunk radio. \"And that also goes for the response that the chancellor's cellphone is not being monitored - because this sentence says nothing about whether the chancellor was monitored in the past.\"\n\n\"This can not be justified from any point of view by the fight against international terrorism or by averting danger,\" Bosbach said.\n\nMerkel had previously raised concerns over allegations of mass electronic eavesdropping when Obama visited Germany in June, demanded answers from the U.S. government, and backed calls for greater European data protection. Her government is striking a markedly sharper tone now, and signaling frustration over the answers provided so far by the U.S. government.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Consider Same-sex Marriage Cases from Five States\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court has scheduled same-sex marriage cases from Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana, and Wisconsin for consideration at its private conference on Monday, indicating a willingness to engage in the ongoing national debate. The justices have the option to consider some or none of these cases, preferring to delay their decision until later in the fall.\n\nBy listing all five cases for consideration simultaneously, the justices have given equal consideration to the Indiana and Wisconsin cases, which were decided last month by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. The 10th and 4th Circuits previously ruled in the other cases.\n\nThe court could choose to hear one or more cases this winter, deny them all, or delay its decision for a while. In all five states, federal district and appellate judges have agreed that state bans on same-sex marriage should be struck down as unconstitutional. However, these decisions are on hold pending the Supreme Court's review.\n\nAdditional same-sex marriage cases could be added to the justices' list soon. A ruling is expected from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit on cases from Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The 9th Circuit heard oral arguments earlier this month in cases stemming from Idaho and Nevada. Cases from Texas and Florida remain at the appellate court level.\n\nIn June 2013, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages legally performed in states that allow them. Since then, the number of states allowing same-sex marriage has grown to 19, along with the District of Columbia. The court also refused to overrule a California court's decision striking down that state's ban.\n\nThirty-one states continue to prohibit gays and lesbians from marrying, including all the states with cases pending before the Supreme Court. The justices are widely expected to rule this term on whether such bans are constitutional.",
    " Title: Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis Skips Women for Trump Event Due to Scheduled Execution\n\nArticle:\n\nFlorida First Lady Casey DeSantis will not attend the Women for Trump event in Tampa, scheduled for Thursday, due to a conflict with a planned execution, according to the governor's office. The event, titled \"An Evening to Empower,\" is centered around the 99th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.\n\nThe event, which is being billed as a get-out-the-vote rally, is also set to feature notable Republican women such as Kellyanne Conway and former Attorney General Pam Bondi, according to an email announcement. However, Casey DeSantis, the wife of Governor Ron DeSantis, will not be in attendance due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nThe execution of Gary Ray Bowles, a serial killer who targeted gay men, is the main reason for Casey DeSantis' absence, according to Alex Garcia, who is overseeing Trump re-election campaign efforts in Florida. Garcia stated that an announcement advertising the event was a \"tad premature.\"\n\nThe celebration event is planned at roughly the same time as the execution of Gary Ray Bowles, for whom Governor Ron DeSantis signed a death warrant earlier this summer. Department of Corrections officials usually maintain constant contact with the governor's office during executions in case questions arise. The governor is informed when an execution has been carried out.\n\nHelen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, a spokesperson for the governor, stated that, though the first lady is not an elected official, \"out of protocol, the executive office of the governor does not participate in any public event\" while an execution is carried out.\n\nIn 2013, Pam Bondi, who is also scheduled to speak at the event, came under heavy criticism after she asked then-Governor Rick Scott to move the date of an execution because it conflicted with a kickoff fundraiser for her re-election. She later stated she should not have requested the date change.",
    " Title: Final Republican Debate of 2015: Seven Observations from the CNN/Salem Radio Debate at The Venetian Las Vegas\n\nArticle:\n\nThe final Republican debate of 2015 took place on Tuesday, December 16, 2014, at The Venetian Las Vegas. This debate, hosted by CNN and Salem Radio, featured nine candidates, a decrease from the previous gathering at the Reagan Presidential Library in September. The debate was truncated, lasting 40 minutes less than the three-hour debate in September.\n\nHere are seven observations from the debate:\n\n1. No One Trumped Trump: The candidates attempted to challenge Donald Trump, the front-runner, on various issues, but their efforts did not significantly impact his position. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul criticized Trump on Internet policy, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush expressed disapproval of Trump's approach. However, Trump's position on the stage was not earned through profound thinking or refined elegance, making it challenging for his rivals to make a lasting impression.\n\n2. The Cage Match: Candidates such as Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Gov. Chris Christie engaged in verbal exchanges, with Rand Paul taking swings at Trump, Rubio, and Christie. The media-desired confrontation between Trump and Cruz did not occur, as both candidates were too smart to take the bait.\n\n3. Executive Order: The debate focused on national security and leadership skills, providing an opportunity for governors Chris Christie and John Kasich to showcase their qualifications. However, both candidates faced challenges. Christie struggled to stand out in a round-robin style of Q&A, while Kasich's rhetorical substance abuse, reciting a long Washington biography, did not resonate with the Republican base.\n\n4. Auld Lang Syne: The debate marked the end of the GOP's debate circuit for 2015. The next debate is scheduled for January 14, 2016, in North Charleston, S.C., hosted by the Fox Business Network.\n\n5. Exam Vibe: The debate had a tired atmosphere, with candidates seeming weary of sharing the same oxygen. Tempers were short, giving the debate a sense of being the last exam before an extended break.\n\n6. Debate Winners: Trump and Cruz were considered the winners of the debate, as they played error-free ball.\n\n7. Debate Losers: Anyone who missed the \"Star Wars\" premiere by staying home to watch the debate was considered a loser, as the debate was mostly uneventful.",
    " Title: Major U.S. Stock Markets Close at Record Highs on Renewed Trade Hopes and Strong Earnings\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all closed at record highs on Monday, as renewed trade hopes and strong earnings propelled stocks higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 114 points, or 0.42 percent, to book its first record close since July 23. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished in record territory for a second straight day.\n\nThe record-setting day came after the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have remained in contact while negotiators craft the final language for the \"phase one\" of the trade agreement between the two economic powers.\n\nMcDonald's shares were lower after the company parted ways with CEO Steve Easterbrook over his consensual relationship with an employee. Easterbrook was instrumental in the company's turnaround, emphasizing a technological shift that included third-party delivery through apps and the installation of kiosks that let customers customize their orders.\n\nUnder Armour was sharply lower after confirming the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission are probing its accounting practices. The athletic-apparel maker reported better-than-expected third-quarter results on Monday morning but cut its sales outlook for the remainder of the year.\n\nFord gained after the United Auto Workers union approved the tentative labor deal that was reached last week.\n\nEarnings reports continued to exceed Wall Street estimates, with over 70 percent of S&P 500 companies reporting, about 76 percent have topped earnings-per-share estimates and 59 percent have beat on revenue, according to Refinitiv.\n\nThe Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14 percent increase in third-quarter profit versus a year ago to $7.86 billion, as its cash pile swelled to a record $128.1 billion.\n\nElsewhere, the luxury automaker Ferrari beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending shares higher.\n\nCommodities gained with West Texas Intermediate crude oil up 0.57 percent at $56.52 a barrel and gold ended little changed near $1,510 an ounce. Treasurys were lower as selling ran the yield on the 10-year note up 5.8 basis points to 1.786 percent.\n\nGlobal stock markets followed Wall Street higher on Monday after the unexpectedly strong U.S. jobs data helped to soothe investor worries. On Friday, the Labor Department said American employers added 128,000 jobs in October, better than the 89,000 forecast.\n\nIn Europe on Monday, Germany's DAX all gained 1.35 percent to pace the advance. In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.6 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.7 percent. Japan's markets were closed for a holiday.\n\nFOX Business' Ken Martin and the Associated Press contributed to this article.",
    " Title: Pope Francis' Comments on Free Speech Spark Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis, a prominent figure in the Catholic Church, has faced criticism following lighthearted comments that included a pretend punch to a colleague during a flight to the Philippines. The comments were made in an attempt to emphasize the need for limits on free speech, including the right to insult another's faith.\n\nWhile speaking to reporters on the plane, the Pope gestured as if he were punching someone, stating, \"If someone were to say a swear word against my mother, this is what I would do.\" The Vatican later clarified that the Pope's words were \"spoken colloquially\" and consistent with his \"free style of speech.\"\n\nThe Pope's comments have raised concerns about his stance on free speech, particularly regarding religion. He stated, \"One cannot provoke, one cannot insult other people's faith, one cannot make fun of faith. There is a limit. Every religion has its dignity... In freedom of expression, there are limits.\"\n\nThe Pope's comments were made in response to a general question about the balance between religious liberty and free expression, and they appear to reference the massacre of journalists at Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. Although the Pope did not directly blame the slain cartoonists for the attack, his comments could be interpreted as implying that such criticism of religion is problematic.\n\nNotable Catholic figures, such as Bill Donahue, president of the New York-based Catholic League, have also raised similar concerns. Donahue stated, \"Charlie Hebdo's Stephane Charbonnier didn't understand the role he played in his own death.\"\n\nIn contrast, Jim Wallis, president of Sojourners, a progressive, evangelical community and publication, suggested a different approach to responding to religious attacks. Wallis wrote, \"Loving your enemies certainly includes supporting the foundational commitment to free speech, and defending the right of free speech, even, or especially, for those who offend you.\"\n\nIn the United States, the Supreme Court outlawed blasphemy laws in 1952. It is hoped that the Pope's comments were intended as counsel for his followers rather than an advocacy for any legal position. As the article concludes, \"No one has the right not to be offended. Even the Pope.\"",
    " Title: CNN and MSNBC Inject Analysis into Chyrons During 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nTelevision news networks, such as CNN and MSNBC, have historically used graphics, known as chyrons, to identify people and places in their news stories. However, during the 2016 presidential race, these networks have begun to incorporate analysis into their chyrons during their news reporting.\n\nThe practice started in June when Donald Trump denied having said Japan should have nuclear weapons. CNN inserted a snarky line in their chyron: \"TRUMP: I NEVER SAID JAPAN SHOULD HAVE NUKES (HE DID)\". Last week, when Eric Trump claimed his father had apologized to the Khan family over remarks he made about them after they spoke at the Democratic National Convention, CNN went with: \"Last week, Trump claimed his father had apologized to the Khan family\".\n\nMSNBC followed suit, using parentheses to add analysis to Trump's statements. When Trump claimed he had seen video of $400 million being sent to Iran by the Obama administration around the time they were releasing American hostages, MSNBC put out: \"TRUMP SAYS HE WATCHED (NONEXISTENT) VIDEO OF IRAN RECEIVING CASH\".\n\nOn Thursday, after Trump described Obama and Hillary Clinton as founders and co-founders of ISIS \u2013 similar to remarks President Obama made in 2015, when he laid the rise of ISIS at the feet of President Bush \u2013 CNN wrote on its graphic: \"OH CNN, YOU SO SNARKY\".\n\nWhile fact-checking may or may not be a legitimate new use of the chyron, what is noticeable is a distinct absence of chyron fact-checking for various claims made by Clinton. For instance, Clinton recently told Fox News' Chris Wallace that FBI Director James Comey had called her answers about her private email use as secretary of state \u201ctruthful\u201d \u2013 he did not make such a sweeping statement. Last month, she claimed GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence had \u201cslashed\u201d education spending as governor of Indiana \u2013 he had not. For these statements, Clinton received a \"false\" rating from Politifact. The CNN and MSNBC chyrons, however, did not deploy their parentheses for those statements.\n\nOutlets like Mediaite and The Daily Caller have also raised questions about a double-standard with the chyrons.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Secure Necessary Votes to Maintain Iran Nuclear Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats have garnered the 34 votes required to maintain the Iran nuclear deal in Congress, marking a significant foreign policy victory for President Barack Obama. Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland provided the crucial 34th vote on Wednesday, stating that the agreement is the most effective means to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nCongress is set to vote later this month on a resolution disapproving the deal, which is universally opposed by Republicans, who label it a risky concession to Iran. Obama has pledged to veto the resolution if it passes, and with 34 votes in hand, Democrats now have the necessary support to uphold his veto.\n\nThe agreement, signed by Iran, the U.S., and five other world powers, aims to dismantle Iran's nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Secretary of State John Kerry is sending a letter to all members of Congress outlining U.S. security commitments to Israel and Gulf Arab states in light of the nuclear deal.\n\nIn a nationally broadcast interview on Wednesday, Kerry stated, \"I really believe the fastest way to a genuine arms race in the Middle East is to not have this agreement. Because if you don't have this agreement, Iran has already made clear what its direction is.\"\n\nWith opposition to the agreement failing to gain traction among Democrats, supporters may even be able to muster the 41 votes needed to block the resolution from passing in the first place, sparing Obama from having to use his veto pen. This would require eight of the 11 remaining undeclared senators to support the deal.\n\nSenators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Chris Coons of Delaware announced their support for the deal on Tuesday, bringing the total number of Senate supporters to 33. In statements, both senators expressed their belief that the agreement will significantly constrain Iran's nuclear program and is the best option available at this time.\n\nRepublicans in Congress and presidential candidates unanimously oppose the deal, which aims to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The Israeli government is strongly against it, contending that concessions made to Iran could empower that country, which has sworn to destroy Israel. However, critics have failed to turn the tide against the agreement during the summer recess, despite a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign funded by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).\n\nOnly two Democratic senators have come out against the deal\u2014Chuck Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey\u2014while in recent weeks undeclared Democratic senators, even from red states, have been breaking in favor of the deal one after another.\n\nEven if Congress were able to pass the disapproval resolution, it would not prevent the deal, which was agreed to among Iran, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China. In July, the U.N. Security Council unanimously endorsed the nuclear deal, approving a resolution that would lift international sanctions on Iran in 90 days.",

The Democratic members of the committee, led by Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), addressed a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf.\n\nThe committee expressed \"serious concerns\" about the \"Constitutional implications\" of officials' statements that left-wing and right-wing extremists are instigating violence at Floyd protests. The committee seeks to understand the truth and evidence behind reports of extremist involvement in protests, as well as how the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the FBI are responding to these issues while ensuring the protection of Americans' civil rights and civil liberties.\n\nThe committee has requested all documents from January 1 to the present related to intelligence on ongoing protests, including information given to law enforcement partners, the designation of groups as domestic terrorist organizations, the deployment of DHS employees at demonstrations, and the surveillance of protesters. The deadline to deliver the documents is June 19, and the committee will be briefed by the DHS and the FBI by June 12.\n\nThe letter follows reports that right-wing and left-wing anti-government groups have been involved in the Floyd protests within Minnesota and across the country. President Trump announced on Monday that the U.S. plans to designate anti-fascist activists, known as antifa, as a terrorist organization, although federal authorities are unable to label domestic groups as terrorist organizations.\n\nAttorney General William Barr also called out the decentralized group on Sunday, stating, \"The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\"",
    " Title: Hope Hicks Returns to White House as Senior Advisor\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington \u2014 Hope Hicks, a former top White House aide and longtime confidante to President Donald Trump, is rejoining the administration approximately two years after her departure. A White House official confirmed that Hicks will work closely with Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and political director Brian Jack. She will not be part of the communications department.\n\nHicks, 31, previously served as a top communications aide before leaving the White House in 2018 to take a position at the Fox Corporation in California. The announcement of Hicks' departure came a day after she testified before the House Judiciary Committee during the Mueller investigation. Hicks is expected to begin her new role in early March, although the exact timeline remains uncertain.\n\n\"There is no one more devoted to implementing President Trump's agenda than Hope Hicks. We are excited to have her back on the team,\" Kushner said in a statement.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham added, \"Hope Hicks is one of the most talented and savvy individuals I have come across. She has always impressed me with her quiet confidence, loyalty, and expertise, and I am beyond thrilled to welcome Hope back to the White House.\"\n\nPrior to her tenure at the White House, Hicks had minimal experience in politics, joining the Trump campaign in its earliest days. Hicks became one of the president's closest advisers, leaving a significant void when she departed. The end of Hicks' tenure at the White House was marked by controversy, as then-White House staff secretary Rob Porter was accused of abuse by his two ex-wives. Porter eventually resigned.\n\nDuring congressional testimony, Hicks admitted to telling some \"white lies\" to defend the president.\n\nHicks' return to the White House follows the formal conclusion of two significant investigations into the president\u2014the Russia investigation and the impeachment saga.\n\nAccording to a source close to Hicks, she is returning out of a sense of duty and purpose. While she enjoyed her life in the corporate world, outside the White House, she is returning partly due to a sense of duty to this president and this administration. The former model had been considering a return over the past few months.",
    " Title: PG&E to Plead Guilty to 84 Counts of Involuntary Manslaughter in Connection with 2018 California Wildfire\n\nArticle:\n\nPacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) has announced it will plead guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in connection with the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California that resulted in the deaths of 84 people and the destruction of three towns. The plea agreement, announced on Monday, resolves the charges facing PG&E as part of a previously sealed indictment in Butte County.\n\nThe plea agreement marks the second time this decade that the company's negligence has resulted in a criminal conviction. In 2010, PG&E was convicted of six felony counts for falsifying records and other safety violations following a natural gas explosion in San Bruno, California, which killed eight people. As with its prior criminal conviction, no one from PG&E will go to prison for the company's felony crimes. Instead, its plea agreement with the Butte County District Attorney's office calls for PG&E to pay a $4 million fine, the maximum allowed.\n\nPG&E will also help pay for efforts to restore access to water for residents affected by the loss of a canal destroyed by the Camp Fire. \"We can not replace all that the fire destroyed, but our hope is that this plea agreement, along with our rebuilding efforts, will help the community move forward from this tragic incident,\" PG&E Corp. CEO Bill Johnson said.\n\nButte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said he hopes the plea agreement will bring \"a bit of a sense of justice done\" for the fire. However, some survivors and victims' families are outraged with the outcome. \"It's a crime against society,\" said Camp Fire survivor Lisa Williams. \"A fine doesn't change their behavior. They pay it and repeat bad behavior.\"\n\nJay Downer, whose wheelchair-using brother died in the fire, also expressed dismay at the price PG&E will pay for its lethal negligence. \"If I fell asleep at the wheel of a car and killed one person, I would be charged with manslaughter and I would be spending time in jail,\" Downer said.\n\nPG&E is scheduled to enter its plea and face sentencing at a court hearing scheduled for April 24. The Nov. 8, 2018, Camp Fire was fanned by strong winds, forcing thousands of people to quickly flee in their cars as flames ripped through the narrow canyon communities. Butte County officials have pegged the 2018 wildfire's death toll at 85, but Ramsey disclosed Monday that further evidence cast doubt about whether one of the deaths was directly caused by the blaze.\n\nThe Camp Fire followed a series of 2017 blazes that tore through Northern California and killed 44 people. Although state investigators didn't find PG&E culpable for those fires, the company is accepting responsibility for them in its bankruptcy case as part of a $13.5 billion settlement that will pay the victims of the 2017 and 2018 fires.\n\nLess than three months after the Butte County fires, PG&E filed for bankruptcy in early 2019 to help shield the utility from more than $50 billion in claimed losses stemming from a badly outdated electrical grid. PG&E has settled those claims for $25.5 billion, including the fund set up for the wildfire victims. Since the bankruptcy filing, PG&E hired Johnson as its new leader to shape up its culture as the company steps up its efforts to improve the safety and reliability of its power lines.\n\nJohnson hailed the plea agreement as a sign that PG&E is \"working to create a better future for all concerned. We want wildfire victims, our customers, our regulators, and leaders to know that the lessons we learned from the Camp Fire remain a driving force for us to transform this company.\" Johnson has previously acknowledged that it will take many years to pull that off while PG&E pours an estimated $40 billion into badly needed upgrades.\n\nIn the meantime, PG&E plans to periodically turn off the power during extremely windy and dry conditions to minimize fire risks in parts of a sprawling service territory that provides electricity to 16 million people. By its own admission, PG&E bungled the deliberate blackouts it imposed last autumn to the exasperation of customers and community leaders who complained about not being told about the outages.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom had previously expressed doubts about whether the company has made enough changes to reform its ways, and he had been threatening to block PG&E's plan to get out of bankruptcy this summer. PG&E's chief regulator, the California Public Utilities Commission, still must approve the company's bankruptcy plan, a decision that's expected within the next few weeks. Last week, Newsom dropped his objections amid the coronavirus outbreak that prompted him to order everyone in the state to remain in their homes as much as possible to reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\nCalifornia holds unusual leverage over PG&E's fate in bankruptcy because the company needs state approval of its plan to qualify for coverage from a wildfire insurance fund that the state created last summer. Newsom backpedaled in a Friday bankruptcy court filing, saying he now believes PG&E's plan qualifies it for the coverage. As part of his deal with PG&E, the Democratic governor is still reserving the right to pursue a government-financed takeover of the company if it doesn't emerge from bankruptcy by a June 30 deadline.",
    " Title: All Members of President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities Resign in Protest of Trump's Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nThe entire 17-member President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities (PCAH) has resigned in response to President Donald Trump's controversial remarks regarding a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The resignation follows Trump's disbanding of the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategy and Policy Forum after several business leaders resigned from these groups in protest over his remarks.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday morning, committee member Kal Penn shared a letter of resignation, stating that the committee's reproach and censure are necessary following Trump's support of the hate groups and terrorists who caused harm in Charlottesville. The letter, which includes an acrostic spelling out \"RESIST,\" has become associated with protests against the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House issued a statement on Friday afternoon claiming that the president had intended to disband the council anyway. This mirrors Trump's previous claim that he was disbanding the Strategy and Policy Forum after all its members had made the decision to disband it on their own.\n\nThe PCAH is a federal agency, unlike the other advisory councils Trump has recently disbanded. It is responsible for education and cultural ambassadorship for the arts and is headed by Melania Trump as honorary chair. Its members were appointed by President Obama and include such cultural figureheads as author Jhumpa Lahiri and writer-director George C. Wolfe.\n\nIn the resignation letter, the committee condemned the administration's refusal to quickly and unequivocally condemn hatred and noted the importance of the arts in creating empathy and love, and the humanities in supporting a vibrant free press. The letter also criticized Trump for his actions and words that the committee deemed as attacking civil liberties, including the elimination of arts and culture agencies, threatening nuclear war, and withdrawing from the Paris agreement, among other actions.\n\nAll 17 members of the committee signed the letter, including Wolfe, who added his signature after Penn's tweet featuring the initial 16 signatories. Though the committee had not met under Trump's administration, Politico reports that it had continued to do some of its basic work, which includes overseeing educational programs and diplomatic functions. The resignation of the full committee makes the PCAH the first White House agency to officially dissolve under President Trump.\n\n\"Supremacy, discrimination, and vitriol are not American values,\" the letter concluded. \"We must be better than this.\"",
    " Title: Trump Prepares to Expand Travel Ban, Considering Additional Countries for Restrictions\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is reportedly planning to extend his travel ban executive order to include more countries, with potential penalties such as enhanced screening for travelers from these nations. Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke has submitted recommendations for countries that should face travel restrictions or additional screening, though the specific countries under consideration have not been disclosed.\n\nThe current travel ban, which temporarily halts some admissions from six countries with terrorist connections, is set to expire on Sunday. Administration officials, including White House, Homeland Security, and State Department officials, have stated that they are looking to update the ban.\n\nThe Trump administration went through a months-long, two-tier review of other countries' information-sharing with the U.S. Countries deemed \"inadequate\" were given a 50-day notice that if they did not comply, they could face restrictions. According to Miles Taylor, counselor to Ms. Duke, some countries were \"still unable or worse yet, deliberately unwilling to comply,\" and will face new restrictions.\n\nThe new standards suggested by Ms. Duke are conditions-based, rather than the time-based 90-day approach taken in the initial executive order. Critics of the travel ban have accused the administration of using religious animus as a driving force behind the policy.\n\nThe original travel ban, which grew out of then-candidate Trump's demand for \"extreme vetting\" of travelers, particularly from Muslim countries, was met with resistance in the courts. The Supreme Court had been set to hear oral arguments on the current version of the travel ban, but may find the case moot if substantial changes are made to the policy tied to the end of the 90-day pause.\n\nOfficials briefing reporters Friday said they cannot predict how the updates will affect the court case since Trump has not announced a final decision yet. The Justice Department has been consulted throughout the process. Under the current ban, the administration is free to block some travel, but must admit refugees worldwide and visitors from the six targeted countries if they prove they have \"bona fide\" ties. The Supreme Court has delivered a mixed verdict on the current ban, ruling that Trump does have important national security powers that must be respected, but also finding that visitors with \"bona fide\" ties to a person or institution in the U.S. have rights that must be respected.",
    " Title: Colorado Baker Files Lawsuit Against State Over Refusal to Make Cake for Transgender Woman\n\nArticle:\n\nJack Phillips, the Colorado baker who won a narrow Supreme Court victory over his refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, has filed a lawsuit against the state after it launched another case against him for declining to create a cake for a transgender woman. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Denver on Tuesday, alleges that Colorado's Civil Rights Commission has violated Phillips' constitutional rights to free speech, freedom of religion, equal protection, and due process.\n\nThe lawsuit names Governor John Hickenlooper, Cynthia Coffman, the state attorney general, and the Colorado Civil Rights Commission as defendants. Phillips seeks permanent injunctions against the state from taking any enforcement action against him, who the lawsuit says was \"vindicated\" by the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn June, the Supreme Court ruled that the Colorado's civil rights commission was hostile toward Phillips' Christian beliefs when it cited him for refusing to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple in 2012. However, the ruling did not rule on whether he violated Colorado's public accommodation statute.\n\nThe lawsuit stems from a complaint filed by Denver attorney Autumn Scardina with the civil rights commission in 2017, in which she claims that Phillips refused to bake a cake that \"celebrates my transition from male to female.\" Scardina did not immediately return a phone message left at her law office.\n\nThe director of the state's Civil Rights Division, Aubrey Elenis, ruled in June that Phillips discriminated against Scardina. \"The evidence thus demonstrates that the refusal to provide service to (Scardina) was based on (her) transgender status,\" Elenis wrote in a probable cause determination. The finding by Elenis requires both sides to resolve the issue through \"compulsory mediation,\" the document said.\n\nPhillips is also seeking $100,000 in punitive damages against Elenis \"for her unconstitutional actions,\" according to the lawsuit. Daniel Ramos, executive director of One Colorado, a group that advocates for the LGBTQ community, blasted the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the conservative Christian group whose lawyers represent Phillips.\n\n\"We have seen the ADF launch similar lawsuits across the country that target nondiscrimination laws and civil rights agencies, and this broad lawsuit they filed on behalf of Jack Phillips reads as more of the same,\" Ramos said. The Colorado Civil Rights Commission declined to comment on Phillips' lawsuit.",
    " Title: Study Indicates Bias in Mainstream Economic News Coverage Favoring Democratic Presidents\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in the journal American Politics Research suggests that mainstream economic news coverage tends to be biased in favor of Democratic presidents. The research, conducted by Eric Merkley, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of British Columbia, provides evidence that the media is more charitable to Democrats than Republicans.\n\nMerkley used automated content analysis software to evaluate the tone of 400,000 news articles related to unemployment and inflation, published between 1985 and 2013 by 23 high-circulating American newspapers and the Associated Press. The study excluded editorials and opinion pieces.\n\nMerkley found that the tone of economic news coverage was more positive during Democratic presidencies, even after controlling for the economic performance. \"Journalists broadly lean to the political left and this has become increasingly true over time,\" Merkley told a media outlet.\n\nHowever, Merkley emphasized that the findings do not suggest that mainstream media deliberately manufactures false or misleading content to harm Republican presidents. Instead, the findings are consistent with confirmation bias, where journalists appropriately reduce tone in economic news in response to worsening economic conditions under Republican presidents, but are problematically more charitable during Democratic administrations.\n\nThe study includes some limitations, and the current research is no exception. Merkley noted that the findings only apply to economic news content and may vary across broader issue types. He also acknowledged that his methodology cannot address the growing conservative echo chamber, such as Fox News, Breitbart News, and Town Hall, and that more work should be done on this issue.\n\nMerkley's study adds to the mixed academic research on media bias, with some studies finding that media outlets present topics in a largely nonpartisan manner, while others suggest patterns of bias vary across issue types. The study's findings highlight the importance of objectivity and impartiality in journalism, particularly during economic news coverage.",
    " Title: Grand Jury to Decide Fate of Ahmaud Arbery's Accused Killers\n\nArticle:\n\nAhmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was shot and killed in February in a neighborhood outside Brunswick, Georgia. The shooting occurred in the Satilla Shores neighborhood, where Arbery did not reside, according to his father. His family stated that he was jogging when the shooting took place.\n\nArbery's friend, Akeem Baker, told The Atlanta Constitution-Journal that Arbery was a frequent runner. A Facebook page and GoFundMe campaign called \"I Run With Maud\" were started to raise awareness about Arbery's killing. As of Wednesday, the GoFundMe had raised over $14,000, and the page had over 21,000 followers. A dedication run is planned for Friday.\n\nNo arrests or charges have been made in the case, according to prosecutor Tom Durden, who stated that a grand jury will hear the evidence in the shooting, but a hearing will not occur until mid-June at the earliest when Georgia courts reopen from coronavirus restrictions.\n\nOn Tuesday, Durden requested the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) to look into the case. GBI Director Vic Reynolds issued a statement Wednesday, stating that his team would operate the investigation out of its headquarters and \"bring to bear every resource and experience this agency has in resolving this matter.\"\n\nAccording to a police report, Arbery was shot after two men saw him running in their neighborhood and armed themselves with guns before getting in a truck to pursue him. Gregory McMichael, one of the men, told police he was in his front yard when he saw \"the suspect from the break-ins\" running. McMichael and his adult son, Travis, grabbed guns because they \"did not know if the male was armed or not.\"\n\nMcMichael and his son chased Arbery, with Travis getting out of the truck with a shotgun. Arbery \"began to violently attack\" Travis, and the two men then started fighting over the shotgun, according to the police report. Travis fired two shots, and Arbery was shot multiple times.\n\nVideo footage of the event has been posted online, showing a black man jogging on a road in daylight. A white truck is parked in the road ahead of him; a man stands in the pickup bed, and another is beside the open driver's-side door. The runner passes the pickup on the passenger side. There is shouting, then a gunshot, and the video shows the runner grappling with a man in the street over what appears to be a shotgun or rifle. A second shot goes off, and the runner punches the man. A third shot is fired at point-blank range. The runner staggers a few feet and falls face down.\n\nA statement released by S. Lee Merritt, an attorney representing Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper, stated that a \"false narrative\" had been created that the video disproved. \"Mr. Arbery had not committed any crime, and there was no reason for these men to believe they had the right to stop him with weapons or to use deadly force in furtherance of their unlawful attempted stop. This is murder,\" Merritt said.\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp, who had not addressed the shooting until this week, tweeted Tuesday that \"Georgians deserve answers.\" Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr stated on Twitter late Tuesday that he is \"deeply concerned with the events surrounding the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery\" and expects \"justice to be carried out as swiftly as possible.\"\n\nDozens of demonstrators walked through Brunswick Tuesday, holding signs that said, \"Justice for Ahmaud Arbery\" and \"I run with Maud.\" More demonstrators walked around the state Capitol in Atlanta on Wednesday, demanding justice. The Georgia NAACP is to hold a protest with Arbery's family at the Glynn County Courthouse on Friday.\n\nSeveral lawmakers have spoken out, including Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who tweeted late Tuesday that Arbery was \"killed in cold blood.\" Former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams stated, \"Our systems of law enforcement and justice must be held to the highest standards.\" She called for a \"full investigation, appropriate charges, and an unbiased prosecution.\" Senator Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a former Democratic presidential candidate, stated on Twitter the video \"sickens me to my core.\" \"Exercising while Black should not be a death sentence,\" she said.",
    " Title: Former Senator Jeff Flake Predicts Republican Challenge to President Trump in 2020\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ), a known critic of President Donald Trump, has predicted that a Republican will challenge the incumbent in the 2020 presidential election. Flake, who has had a contentious relationship with Trump, expressed his belief that a Republican contender will emerge, and he also suggested the possibility of an independent candidate.\n\nDuring an interview, Flake stated, \"I do think the president will have a challenge from the Republican Party. I think there should be. I also think that there will be an independent challenge, particularly if the Democrats insist on putting somebody up from the far left of the party.\"\n\nFlake's comments come as President Trump has announced his intention to run for re-election in 2020, citing his accomplishments in his first year, such as tax reform, a record number of judicial appointments, and the appointment of a new conservative justice to the Supreme Court.\n\nFlake's potential rival, Ohio's Republican Governor John Kasich, has been mentioned as a possible contender for the White House. When asked about his own presidential aspirations, Flake did not rule out the possibility of an independent run.\n\nThroughout the past year, Flake and Trump have clashed on various issues. In July 2017, Flake published a book titled \"Conscience of a Conservative,\" in which he criticized Trump for leading the Republican Party to compromise its principles. Trump responded to Flake's book during a rally in Arizona in August 2017, labeling him and Senator John McCain as \"weak\" on border issues.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, Flake announced his retirement from the Senate. During his farewell speech, he compared Trump's rhetoric to that of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's, stating, \"I do not think that we should be using a phrase that's been rejected as too loaded by a Soviet dictator.\"\n\nIf Flake decides to challenge Trump in 2020, the debates between the two would likely be a highly anticipated event.",
    " Title: False Claims Act in Healthcare: A Study on Its Impact and Misuse\n\nArticle:\n\nA new working paper from the Independence Institute, penned by attorneys Mark W. Pearlstein and Laura McLane, discusses the use and misuse of the False Claims Act (FCA) in the healthcare sector. The FCA, enacted in 1863 to combat fraudulent billing during the Civil War, has become a tool for private individuals to sue entities suspected of defrauding the federal government.\n\nBetween 2009 and June 2016, over 4,700 FCA actions were filed, with awards ranging from $11,000 to $22,000 per detected fraud, and treble damages. The Act's spoils are divided among the person alleging the fraud, their attorneys, and the federal government. In 2014, the Department of Justice reported that FCA \"recoveries\" totaled $5.79 billion, with health care lawsuits accounting for $2.3 billion of that amount.\n\nThe federal government investigates every FCA case, with the initial investigation conducted under seal. Defendants may be unaware of the investigation until their business documents are subpoenaed. An individual alleging fraud can proceed with a case even if the government decides against it.\n\nThe FCA's original intent was to prosecute fraud cases involving contractors billing the U.S. government for nonexistent or worthless goods, not to prosecute contractors for failing to adhere to specific manufacturing standards or minor differences of opinion. However, the paper suggests that the FCA is increasingly used as a blunt instrument to extract large sums from businesses, leading to lawsuits against nursing homes, hospitals, doctors, insurers, clinical laboratories, pharmaceutical manufacturers, software providers, managed care organizations, and universities funded by federal grants.\n\nPlaintiffs allege various issues, including too little care, too much care, billing errors, record-keeping violations, and differences in opinion about medical necessity. The Department of Health and Human Services certifies provider performance using various methods and has administrative enforcement tools to influence contractor behavior.\n\nIn 2015, the Fourth Circuit upheld a $237 million FCA verdict in United States ex rel. Drakeford v. Tuomey. The case involved a business entity related to Tuomey Regional Medical Center, which had part-time employment agreements with 19 surgeons and gastroenterologists. The physicians had agreed to use Tuomey facilities when they performed procedures on their private patients. Plaintiffs argued that the contract violated the Stark Law because physicians who performed more procedures earned more.\n\nAfter 10 years of litigation, Tuomey settled with the federal government, agreeing to pay $72.4 million and sell itself to another health system. Many FCA defendants settle because they cannot afford to prove their innocence. The government often requires signing a Corporate Integrity Agreement as part of the settlement terms, giving it control of the defendant's business activities for many years.\n\nA judge in the Tuomey case wrote that the hospital was caught in \"a n impenetrably complex set of laws and regulations that will result in a likely death sentence for a community hospital in an already medically underserved area.\" He concluded that \"even for well-intentioned health care providers, the Stark Law has become a booby trap rigged with strict liability and potentially ruinous exposure\u2014especially when coupled with the False Claims Act.\"\n\nPearlstein and McLaine argue that the aggressive use of the FCA in healthcare cases goes beyond the traditional understanding of fraud. Unless Congress revises the statute, it will continue to harm patients by allowing routine second-guessing of physician decisions, raise costs by encouraging meritless whistle-blowing for money, and impair access to care as risk-averse participants bow out.\n\nLinda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Center at the Independence Institute, a free-market think tank in Denver, notes the impact of the FCA on healthcare.",
    " Title: Obama's West Coast Fundraising Tour Aims to Bolster Democratic Party Committee Coffers\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama embarked on a three-day fundraising tour in the West Coast to support the Democratic Party committees for the 2014 election cycle. The tour comes at a time when the political climate has become challenging for Democratic candidates, particularly in the Senate, due to the flawed rollout of the Affordable Care Act's federal insurance marketplace and the ongoing debate over the law's implementation.\n\nThe fundraising tour is a critical obligation for Obama, who can now focus on this task after having built a billion-dollar war chest for his own re-election. Jim Manley, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and a Democratic strategist with QGA Public Affairs, stated, \"It's kind of better late than never.\" He added, \"There are a whole bunch of Democrats on the Hill who wish he had done more in years past.\"\n\nThe Affordable Care Act's implementation issues and the controversy surrounding whether Obama knowingly misled the public about insurance coverage have caused concern among Democrats across the country about the law's future. Vulnerable red state Democrats, such as Sen. Mary Landrieu (R-La.), and challengers, like Michelle Nunn, who is running for Senate in Georgia, have proposed various solutions, including delaying the individual mandate and allowing Americans to keep their health insurance coverage indefinitely.\n\nObama's job approval and favorability ratings have declined, according to a recent \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll. These sentiments could negatively impact Democrats running for re-election in 2014. Bill Galston, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton and chair of the Brookings Institute's Governance Studies program, noted, \"If the president is way down in the public's esteem, that's going to create a big headwind for Democrats running for re-election.\"\n\nHowever, Obama is not the first (nor will he be the last) president to face criticism within his own party. Poll numbers can be volatile, and the government shutdown, which seemed to leave Republicans in a weakened position weeks ago, has since energized the GOP due to the health care law's early troubles. If Democrats can shift the focus away from the broken website and onto economic issues, they may perform well in 2014, according to top Democratic pollster Joel Benenson.\n\nObama is also facing criticism from Democratic activists who are frustrated with the lack of progress on other issues, such as immigration reform. Despite the support of Silicon Valley CEOs, who have donated tens of thousands of their own money to boost Obama and advocate for immigration reform, the prospects of an immigration bill passing through the House of Representatives are slim.\n\nThe timing of Obama's fundraising swing has been criticized, with some suggesting it could not have been worse for the president and his political team. Tickets to one of Obama's fundraisers were reportedly discounted, and at an event on immigration reform in San Francisco, he was heckled by pro-immigration reform activists.\n\nRepublicans are capitalizing on the health care law's troubles, viewing its implementation as their greatest political advantage. They are unlikely to shift their focus away from the health care law and onto other issues like immigration reform or gun control. Even news of a potential deal on Iran's nuclear program has not deterred Republicans from viewing the health care law as a political asset.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Obama's numbers will improve and whether 2014 will prompt a full-scale revolt among vulnerable or even potentially vulnerable Democrats running. However, in the meantime, Galston suggested that Obama's primary focus should be on extending a lifeline to his fellow Democrats, as he is, to some extent, responsible for their current predicament. Galston stated, \"The president's position now has to be that he will be inclined to do almost everything that the party asks him to do to get them out of a tough spot.\"",
    " Title: Democrat Governors Criticize President Trump's Handling of Reopening Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint response, Governors J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan have criticized President Donald Trump for his support of protests demanding the reopening of businesses in their respective states. The governors claim that Trump's stance is spreading fear and potentially endangering the public.\n\nGovernor Pritzker, speaking to Washington Post reporter Robert Costa, stated, \"I know what he's trying to do. It's a political maneuver in the middle of a national emergency, and he should stop it. What could it mean? It could mean terrible things. You could end up with violence.\"\n\nPritzker also expressed concern that large gatherings of protesters could lead to the spread of the coronavirus, potentially causing illness and death among the population. \"People gathering in large crowds will be giving each other coronavirus, and people, unfortunately, will get sick and some people may die as a result of the president\u2019s rhetoric that has brought them out to protest,\" he said.\n\nGovernor Whitmer, in an interview with The Associated Press, criticized Trump's call to suspend immigration during the coronavirus crisis, stating it was part of a series of \"inconsistent messages\" designed to spread fear and put the public at greater risk. Instead, she emphasized the need for resources to increase coronavirus testing, stating, \"This is what we need right now, not additional new things to be upset about, fearful of or mad about.\"\n\nWhitmer also denied that her comments against Trump's actions were an attempt to position herself as a potential running mate for presumptive Democrat nominee Joe Biden. Instead, she stated her focus is on managing the coronavirus crisis in her state. However, her strict rules, including bans on certain purchases or travel to property owned in the state, have led to protests at the state capital, including from people who want to return to work as Michigan's unemployment rates soar. More than 1 million people in her state are unemployed due to closures under the governor's office or job losses since the outbreak began.",

The conversation provided a glimpse into Trump's diplomatic strategy.\n\nTrump stated, \"You are a terrific guy. You are doing amazing work which is visible in every way,\" during the call, according to the readout. He also expressed his readiness to play any role that Prime Minister Sharif wants him to play in addressing and finding solutions to outstanding issues.\n\nThe call, which included Sharif's congratulations on Trump's election victory and an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, showcased Trump's penchant for hyperbole, a trait he often exhibited during his off-the-cuff campaign speeches.\n\nTrump further stated, \"Please convey to the Pakistani people that they are amazing and all Pakistanis I have known are exceptional people.\"\n\nThe full readout of the call, according to the Pakistani government, is as follows:\n\n\"Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif called President-elect USA Donald Trump and felicitated him on his victory. President Trump said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, you have a very good reputation. You are a terrific guy. You are doing amazing work which is visible in every way. I am looking forward to see you soon. As I am talking to you Prime Minister, I feel I am talking to a person I have known for long. Your country is amazing with tremendous opportunities.

    " Title: Federal Court's Interpretation of Trump's Travel Ban Challenged for Alleged Misinterpretation of Precedent\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a nationwide injunction on President Donald Trump's temporary halt on immigration from six majority-Muslim countries, sparking controversy and allegations of misinterpretation of existing precedent. This new interpretation, coined as \"Trumplaw,\" has been criticized for its potential impact on national security and disregard for established legal principles.\n\nThe court's ruling hinges on two main points: first, that Trump's campaign statements were so offensive that they granted a Muslim resident standing to challenge an executive order that did not apply to him; second, that the harm caused to the plaintiff's feelings and potential delayed entry of his wife into the United States outweighs the government's asserted national-security interest in pausing immigration from hostile and war-torn countries.\n\nCritics argue that Trumplaw is difficult to reconcile with existing precedent, as it often requires courts to yank laws out of context, misinterpret them, and rewrite them to reach a desired outcome. One example is the Fourth Circuit's reading of the Supreme Court case, Kleindienst v. Mandel. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled against a Belgian journalist seeking a non-immigrant visa due to his advocacy of Marxist doctrines, despite the First Amendment's protection of such activities.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit, however, interpreted Mandel to argue that the Court looked only at the face of the document to determine whether its supporting reasons were legitimate, not whether they were \"bona fide.\" This interpretation, according to critics, would have altered the outcome in Mandel and other key Supreme Court cases, and goes against the Court's refusal to look behind notices and documents to explore the subjective motivations of relevant government officials.\n\nThe dissent, led by Judge Paul Niemeyer, argues that this approach grants the court the power to conduct an extratextual search for evidence suggesting bad faith, which is prohibited by three Supreme Court opinions. The dissent asserts that the majority's interpretation rejects clear holdings in Mandel, Fiallo, and Din, and favors a politically desired outcome.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the travel ban and the interpretation of Trumplaw is ongoing, with critics arguing that the court's decision risks national security and sets a dangerous precedent for future administrations. The principle established by the Fourth Circuit's decision is that a judge's dislike of a politician's campaign statements can taint actions that clearly contradict those statements, potentially allowing for the manipulation of legal interpretations for political purposes.",
    " Title: Wind Energy Helps Texas and Other States Weather Extreme Cold Weather, Highlighting U.S. Grid Vulnerability\n\nArticle:\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas set a new winter record for power usage due to frigid temperatures. However, the state managed to avoid major power outages, in part due to increased output from West Texas wind farms. This is not the first time wind energy has helped Texas avoid power outages in extreme weather; in 2011, high wind outputs during peak demand helped Texas's grid weather 100-plus temperatures.\n\nSimilarly, wind energy is aiding other states in dealing with the ongoing Polar Vortex. According to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), when the temperatures began dropping in the Upper Midwest, wind generated enough energy to power 6 million average homes. The Mid-Atlantic region also saw high wind energy output, which helped bolster the grid after some power plants failed unexpectedly due to the weather.\n\nHowever, this week's Polar Vortex has put the vulnerability of the U.S. energy grid in focus. On Tuesday, electricity demand in parts of the Southeast U.S. was the second-highest it's been in winter since the 1920s, according to the Tennessee Valley Authority. Parts of Tennessee lost power during the night, and parts of South Carolina instituted rolling blackouts to manage the electricity demand. Earlier this week, 40,000 people in Indiana lost power, and people across the country were urged to conserve power to help the grid deal with the spike in demand.\n\nSevere weather is the number one cause of power outages in the U.S., meaning that as extreme events become more common, the U.S. power grid will be put more and more at risk. Between 2003 and 2012, extreme weather caused over 675 power outages and cost the U.S. between $18 billion to $33 billion per year, according to a report by the President's Council of Economic Advisers and the Department of Energy. The report, released in August, states that transmission line construction in the U.S. has slowed from 10,000 miles built per year in the late 1960s to just 1,000 miles per year in the mid-2000s. This slowdown means about 70 percent of U.S. transmission lines and power transformers are over 25 years old.\n\nMassoud Amin, an electrical engineering professor at the University of Minnesota, estimates that updating the country to Smart Grid technology would cost $21 billion per year for the next two decades, but would ultimately result in savings of between $79 and $94 billion per year.\n\n\"As a nation, we must take action to improve our electric grid if we want to meet the power needs of a pervasively digital society,\" Amin wrote in Forbes in 2012. \"Americans should not accept or learn to cope with increasing blackouts.\"",
    " Title: Conservative Groups Launch Ad Campaign, Town Hall Meetings to Defund Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nConservative political advocacy groups, including Heritage Action for America, ForAmerica, and Tea Party Patriots, are escalating their efforts to defund President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) by launching new online ad campaigns and town hall meetings starting this week.\n\nHeritage Action for America, a leading conservative advocacy group, announced on Monday that it would spend over half a million dollars to run online ads in the districts of 100 House Republican lawmakers who have not joined the push to defund the healthcare law. Last month, Heritage Action joined 49 other conservative groups in demanding the House GOP leadership pass a bill to fund the government but not allow any money for Obamacare.\n\nIn a statement, Heritage Action CEO Michael A. Needham said, \"The American people may have been locked out of the legislative process that gave us Obamacare, but they will be the force behind stopping this unworkable, unaffordable law. Congress should seize the moment and defund the entire law.\"\n\nOn the same day, two other conservative groups, ForAmerica and Tea Party Patriots, also launched an online ad campaign targeting GOP senators and House Speaker John Boehner in an effort to persuade them to defund Obamacare.\n\nSome conservative lawmakers, including Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Mike Lee of Utah, are using upcoming budget battles as leverage, vowing to oppose any measure that provides funding for the federal government that includes funding for the health care law. The measure funding the federal government expires on September 30, setting up another Capitol Hill budget battle between congressional Republicans and the White House.\n\nHowever, so far, only slightly more than a dozen fellow Republican senators have signed up to support the cause, leaving it up to outside conservative groups to rally the base.\n\nThe announcement of internet ads by Heritage Action, which is a sister organization of the Heritage Foundation, one of the oldest and largest conservative think tanks, comes on the same day the group is launching a nine-stop \"Defund Obamacare Tour.\" Joining the series of townhalls, which kick off on Monday in Fayetteville, Arkansas, are former Sen. Jim DeMint, the Heritage Foundation president, and Rafael Cruz, the father of Sen. Cruz. The senator from Texas will join DeMint and his father at the second town hall on Tuesday in Dallas.\n\nTwo progressive groups, Americans United for Change and Protect Your Care, plan counter-protests outside the townhalls. \"Pro-Health Reform advocates are going to meet the repealers and defunders on the battlefield and confront them directly and aggressively,\" says Brad Woodhouse, president of Americans United for Change. \"A strong majority of the American people want the Affordable Care Act implemented and fixed if necessary \u2013 they do not want it repealed \u2013 which is the only plan for health care Republicans have.\"\n\nAmericans appear divided on whether they want the law, which passed in 2010 along party lines when the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. In one of the most recent surveys on the law, conducted last month for CBS News, nearly four in ten called for the entire law to be repealed, with 18% saying that just the measure's controversial individual mandate should be repealed. Thirty-six percent of those questioned said that the law should be kept as is, or expanded.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Support Universal Background Checks for Gun Purchases, Despite Opposition from Gun Lobby\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll, 91% of Americans expressed support for universal background checks for gun purchases, with only 8% opposing the measure. This overwhelming majority was consistent across households with guns, with 88% in favor and 11% against.\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA), a powerful lobbying group known for its advocacy of gun rights, has been identified as a key opponent of universal background checks. The NRA, with approximately 4.5 million members, has been accused of being influenced by gun manufacturers who prioritize profits over public safety.\n\nThe poll suggests that the NRA's efforts to portray universal background checks as a potential precursor to gun confiscation have been successful, with 48% of respondents believing that such checks would lead to the government confiscating legally owned guns. However, this belief is widely considered to be unfounded, as the poll indicates that only 8% of the population opposes the checks.\n\nThe opposition to universal background checks primarily stems from concerns about the potential impact on profits for gun manufacturers. Background checks would close a loophole in the current system, preventing sales to felons and the mentally ill, which would reduce the market for guns and, consequently, profits.\n\nThe poll also revealed that some gun owners are concerned about additional gun regulations, while others fear that background checks could expose them to potential tyranny from their own government or foreign powers. However, these concerns seem unfounded, as universal background checks would not infringe on the constitutional right to bear arms or lead to gun confiscation.\n\nDespite the opposition from the gun lobby, the poll suggests that a majority of Americans support measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. The poll also found that many other countries, with similar requirements and lower rates of gun violence, have successfully implemented similar measures.\n\nIn conclusion, the poll indicates that a significant majority of Americans support universal background checks for gun purchases. Despite the opposition from the gun lobby, the poll suggests that the public is largely in favor of measures to keep guns out of the hands of those who should not possess them.",
    " Title: Trump, Pence, and Rubio Unveil New Cuba Policy in Miami\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump in Miami, Florida on Friday to announce the White House's new Cuba policy. Rubio praised the president for his compassion towards the Cuban people, who continue to face challenges under the dictatorial leadership of Raul Castro.\n\nIn multiple conversations since the election, Rubio shared that Trump had frequently asked, \"What are we going to do about Cuba?\"\n\nPresident Trump outlined some of the ways he intends to empower the people of Cuba, starting by canceling many of the provisions in the Obama administration's \"one-sided\" deal with the Castro regime.\n\n\"The Cuban American community has so much love,\" Trump said, acknowledging the warm welcome he received upon his arrival. He commended the community for building a vibrant culture in Miami, noting it as \"a testament to what a free Cuba can be.\"\n\n\"With God's help, a free Cuba is what we will soon achieve,\" he added.\n\nPresident Trump, in contrast to his predecessor, pledged to expose communism as a failed system. He promised, \"Now that I am president, we will expose the crimes of the Castro regime.\"\n\nThe president outlined several demands his administration will be making of Castro. These include not lifting sanctions until all political prisoners are free, all parties are legalized, and free elections are scheduled. He also plans to restrict U.S. dollars going to a military that is the cause of the Castro regime, enforce the ban on tourism and embargo, and ensure that investments flow directly to the people so they can open private businesses.\n\nFurthermore, Trump demanded that Castro stop harboring fugitives and criminals like Joanne Chesimard, who escaped from prison in 1979 and has been hiding in Cuba since gaining political asylum in 1984.\n\nTrump concluded his remarks and proceeded to sign the new policy document. \"America will expose the crimes of the Castro regime and stand with the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom,\" he said.",
    " Title: World Leaders Adopt Flattery Strategy in Dealing with President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nDiplomacy, a complex art, requires an understanding of other cultures to avoid potential faux pas during diplomatic visits. Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz has demonstrated a unique approach in dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump, employing a strategy of flattery that has been adopted by various world leaders since Trump took office.\n\nDuring Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia on Sunday, King Salman greeted him with a grand ceremony that included a military flyover, cannons, an elaborate cardamom coffee service, and the presentation of a gold medal. This level of adulation was not extended to the last American president, Barack Obama, during his visit in 2009.\n\nThe New York Times recently published a checklist of dos and don'ts for leaders meeting with President Trump. The advice includes being concise, offering numerous compliments, and avoiding lengthy monologues. Leaders are also advised to acknowledge Trump's Electoral College victory, contrast him favorably with his predecessor, and maintain regular contact.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, during her January visit, called Trump's election win \"stunning.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referenced Trump's book, The Art of the Deal. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe complimented Trump's golf swing.\n\nHowever, Trump's efforts at statecraft on his first day in Saudi Arabia were not as overt as those of other leaders. First Lady Melania and daughter Ivanka, who accompanied the president, opted not to wear headscarves, despite Trump's own deep knowledge of Middle Eastern manners. Trump, however, did thank King Salman for the medal by dipping what appeared to be a tiny curtsey.",
    " Title: ISIS Militants Attack Kirkuk in Northern Iraq, Clashes Continue in Other Regions\n\nArticle:\n\nISIS militants have launched an attack on the strategically important city of Kirkuk in northern Iraq, a move that could potentially be an attempt to capture the oil-rich city or to divert Kurdish troops engaged in the fight to capture ISIS' stronghold of Mosul. The city, located on top of some of Iraq's largest oil reserves, has not fallen to ISIS, unlike many other notable cities in northern Iraq.\n\nFor months, ISIS has been clashing with the Peshmerga, armed fighters who protect Iraqi Kurdistan, to the west of Kirkuk. The militants have moved into areas on Kirkuk's outskirts but not the central city. On Friday, heavily armed militants attacked an abandoned hotel in central Kirkuk that local police had used as their headquarters. Peshmerga and Kurdish anti-terror units later regained control of the hotel, killing three militants and two suicide bombers.\n\nIn addition to the attack on Kirkuk, ISIS militants took over Maktab Khalid, an area about 12 miles southwest of Kirkuk, after heavy clashes with the Peshmerga. Among those killed was Brig. Gen. Shirko Fateh, the highest-ranking operational commander of the Peshmerga brigade located in Kirkuk. Photos posted by ISIS purportedly show the group's militants in control of parts of south and southwest Kirkuk, burning tents that had been used by Peshmerga troops.\n\nThe U.S. military said Friday that an ISIS chemical weapons expert was killed during a coalition strike late last week. Abu Malik worked in Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons program before joining al Qaeda in 2005, U.S. Central Command said. \"His death is expected to temporarily degrade and disrupt the terrorist network and diminish (ISIS's) ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people,\" the military said.\n\nThere is no public evidence that ISIS has a dedicated weapons of mass destruction program. However, U.S. Central Command said: \"His past training and experience provided the terrorist group with expertise to pursue a chemical weapons capability.\"\n\nKirkuk is one of the few notable cities, apart from the region of Kurdistan and its capital, Erbil, that have not fallen to ISIS. The Kurds and the central Iraqi government in Baghdad have long disputed control of Kirkuk's oil reserves, with each side wanting to keep hold of them. ISIS, which relies heavily on revenue from oil smuggling to fund its operations, has also been coveting them.\n\nPeshmerga forces took over the Kirkuk area in June when the Iraqi army crumbled in the face of ISIS' advances and have played a vital role in defending it from ISIS since. In December, ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack there that killed at least 17 people and injured more than 20. The attack, according to ISIS, was meant to send a message to the Kurdish people and Peshmerga fighters.\n\nStill, Kirkuk is hardly the only place that has seen recent fighting. The group has been fending off an offensive from Peshmerga fighters around Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict, that has left the Sunni extremist group on its heels. The city of 1.5 million people on the Tigris River has been held by ISIS since June. ISIS has invested heavily in governing the city. Its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the Grand Mosque there in July.\n\nKurdish officials say that as long as ISIS holds Mosul, it threatens Kurdistan. Likewise, neither the government in Baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy Iraq's second-largest city. Peshmerga forces have made steady progress against ISIS north and west of Mosul over the past two months. They have taken some 3,000 square kilometers (1,160 square miles) of the Sinjar area, as well as the area around the Mosul Dam, choking off access routes and threatening ISIS' main resupply routes.\n\nThere's little doubt that ISIS remains a very real force and threat in much of Iraq. The group, which calls itself the Islamic State, still controls a vast swath of that Middle Eastern nation and neighboring Syria. Its goal is to have a vast caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law, with its followers proving they will stop at nothing\u2014having been blamed for the large-scale killings of civilians, mass kidnappings, and forcing women and girls to become sex slaves\u2014during its quest. That violent campaign continued Friday, and not just in Kirkuk.\n\nDozens of gunmen believed to be from ISIS faced off Friday morning about 175 miles (285 kilometers) away in central Ramadi, police and health officials in that city said. Several hours later, that onslaught had been foiled, and 20 gunmen were dead, according to the officials. Elsewhere in Ramadi, a suicide car bomb explosion at an Iraqi army checkpoint killed one soldier and wounded six others. Violence flared in other parts of Iraq as well, further proof of the country's unsettled state. Six explosions went off Friday around Baghdad, leaving at least seven dead and 23 wounded, according to police officials. The deadliest such blast was in Bab Al Sharji, a busy commercial area in central Baghdad, leaving three dead and 10 hurt.",
    " Title: Progressives and Historical Figures: A Dilemma of Moral Judgment and Selective Memory\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate surrounding the removal of historical figures with controversial pasts, such as Confederate generals and other racially insensitive individuals, has sparked a discussion about the proper rules of exemption for progressives when waging war against the past. The question arises: do progressives erase the history of their racist heroes or only their racist enemies?\n\nIn some cases, the condemnation of figures from the past may be warranted, such as Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest, a founding member of the Ku Klux Klan, or Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney, who wrote the majority opinion in the racist Dred Scott decision. However, the wide liberal search for more enemies of the past may lead progressives down a hypocritical path, as they may have to disassociate themselves from historical figures who were once considered progressive icons, such as Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, who was an unapologetic racist and eugenicist.\n\nThe issue of selective memory and moral judgment is further complicated by the fact that many historical figures, such as Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Susan B. Anthony, Earl Warren, President Woodrow Wilson, and Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, have been associated with racist or discriminatory actions or statements. The question then becomes: what are the proper rules of exemption for progressives when waging war against the dead?\n\nSome argue that the rules should be based on a tally of the dead's good and bad behaviors, with a 51 percent \"good progressive\" cutoff that exempts them from condemnation. Others argue that reactionary sins may cancel out all the progressive good, at least in the eyes of self-styled moral superiors.\n\nThe debate also raises questions about the ultimate purpose of progressives condemning the past. Does toppling a statue or renaming a building improve racial relations or reduce unemployment in the inner city? Does it make us feel better about doing something symbolic when we can't do something substantive? Or is it a sign of raw power and ego when activists force authorities to cave to their threats and remove images and names in the dead of night?\n\nThe debate over historical figures with controversial pasts is a complex one, with no easy answers. It raises questions about moral judgment, selective memory, and the role of historical figures in shaping our society. As the debate continues, it is important to approach the issue with a nuanced and thoughtful perspective, recognizing the complexities and nuances of history and the role that historical figures have played in shaping our society.",
    " Title: Analysis of Trump Derangement Syndrome and Its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe concept of Trump Derangement Syndrome, a term coined over a decade ago, has resurfaced in recent times, characterized by intense criticism and perceived psychological issues towards President Donald Trump. This syndrome is not just general outrage towards the president, but also the inability to discern legitimate policy differences from signs of mental instability.\n\nOne example of this is Trump's decision regarding climate change and the Paris Agreement. The response to his withdrawal was met with hyperbolic language, such as \"America just resigned as leader of the free world.\" However, the Paris Agreement, according to the author, was a failure due to its lack of uniform commitments and enforcement provisions. Critics argue that developing countries like China and India should be given leeway due to a two-century head start in industrialization.\n\nThe author argues that the Paris Agreement was \"hot air\" and withdrawing was a reasonable policy choice. The subsequent attacks on Trump were deemed unhinged due to the president's other behavior providing ample opportunity for shock and dismay.\n\nThe article also discusses Trump's tweets, which the author suggests serve as a direct conduit from the president's unconscious mind. The president's tweets have been criticized for their inappropriate and insensitive content, particularly during times of crisis.\n\nExamples of this include Trump's tweets mocking the mayor of London after a terror attack, using the atrocity to renew an old feud with a foreign official, and undermining the case for his travel ban as it goes to the Supreme Court. The author also criticizes Trump's tweets about the administration's \"extreme vetting\" process, which contradicts the purpose of the travel ban.\n\nThe article concludes by questioning the sustainability of Trump's behavior, quoting economist Herb Stein's statement, \"If something can not go on forever, it will stop.\" However, the author expresses doubt about what, other than a smoking gun produced by the Russia inquiry, could actually stop Trump's behavior.\n\nThe article does not take a political stance but instead provides a critical analysis of Trump's behavior and the concept of Trump Derangement Syndrome. It is important to note that the author's opinions and interpretations are presented as such, and readers are encouraged to form their own conclusions based on the information provided.",
    " Title: First Lady Michelle Obama Discusses Alleged Racial Experiences in Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with People magazine, First Lady Michelle Obama discussed her experiences with alleged racism. The interview, published this week, details an incident at a Target store where she felt she was treated as a subservient.\n\nAccording to the interview, Mrs. Obama recounted an incident where a woman asked her for help reaching an item on a shelf. She described this as a \"challenge\" for the country to overcome, stating that such incidents are \"the regular course of life\" for African-Americans.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the specific details of the incident, as well as the broader context of the experiences Mrs. Obama described, have been met with skepticism by some. Critics argue that the incident at Target, as described, is not an example of racism but rather a common act of courtesy between equals.\n\nIn the past, Mrs. Obama has shared a similar anecdote, but in a different context. In 2012, she recounted the same incident on David Letterman's show, presenting it as a feel-good story demonstrating her relatability.\n\nThe first lady's discussion of her experiences has sparked debate, with some arguing that her narrative is a calculated attempt to pander to America's aggrieved leftists. Critics point to her past statements and actions, such as her senior thesis at Princeton University, titled \"Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community,\" which decried her racial otherness and accused her university of pushing her towards \"assimilation into a white cultural and social structure.\"\n\nDespite these criticisms, it is important to approach such discussions with a nuanced and balanced perspective, recognizing the complexities and nuances of race relations in America.",
    " Title: Senate Votes to Proceed with Impeachment Trial Without Additional Witnesses or Evidence\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate voted 51-49 on Friday to set rules for the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump that do not allow for any more witnesses or motions. The vote ensures that the trial will proceed without additional testimony or evidence, and a final vote is set for Wednesday at 4 p.m., where Trump is expected to be acquitted.\n\nThe decision to proceed without witnesses was met with criticism from Democrats, who argued that a trial without witnesses and evidence would not be legitimate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said, \"To not allow a witness, a document, no witnesses, no documents, in an impeachment trial is a perfidy. It's a grand tragedy.\"\n\nRepublicans countered that Democrats bungled the impeachment in the House, denying Trump fair rights and delivering two articles that were fatally flawed. One White House official said Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) move to hold onto the articles for weeks, saying she wanted to try to dictate the terms of the Senate's trial, helped build GOP unity against the impeachment effort.\n\nOne of the most significant mistakes made by Democrats was Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) attempt to drag Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. into the political fray. In a question to the chief justice, Warren asked, \"At a time when large majorities of Americans have lost faith in government, does the fact that the chief justice is presiding over an impeachment trial in which Republican senators have thus far refused to allow witnesses or evidence contribute to the loss of legitimacy of the chief justice, the Supreme Court, and the Constitution?\"\n\nRepublican senators say no such threats had been made, and for Warren to suggest it irked key GOP lawmakers. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said it had \"become clear some of my colleagues intend to further politicize this process, and drag the Supreme Court into the fray, while attacking the chief justice.\"\n\nIn the final days of last week, Democrats made several other efforts to try to rope the chief justice into the political fray, including offering a proposal to have the Senate outsource key decisions over witnesses and evidence to him.\n\nWith Sen. Murkowski firmly in the GOP corner, the Senate was able to avoid a tie-breaking vote by the chief justice, preserving his independence. Chief Justice Roberts made clear he would have declined to cast a vote anyway.\n\nThe handful of Republicans sympathetic to the Democrats' complaints about the president didn't go as far as Schumer in criticizing the Democrats' handling of the impeachment trial. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) called Trump's demand for Ukraine to investigate a political opponent \"inappropriate,\" but said the answer was to let voters decide, not remove the president by Senate conviction.\n\nAlexander was the 50th vote against witnesses, and Sen. Murkowski was the crucial 51st. In the case of a 50-50 tie, the chief justice would have been under pressure to cast a tie-breaking vote. With Murkowski in board, the GOP was able to avoid that and preserve the chief justice's independence.",

The incident, which occurred on Wednesday, involved Marilyn Synek, a communications specialist who was identified as a former volunteer for Republican U.S. Senator Ben Sasse and a supporter of the Nebraska Family Alliance, a conservative policy organization.\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner, Synek, 23, told the paper that an employee approached her, called her by name, and began yelling profanities at her. The employee allegedly asked Synek to leave and informed her that she would be denied service due to her \"bigoted\" views.\n\nSynek, who stated she frequents the coffee shop weekly, also told the Examiner that the employee declared, \"You are f*cking bigoted trash, and we do not want you in our restaurant.\" The employee reportedly added, \"Over 80 percent of the people who work here are queer. You are not f*cking wanted in our restaurant, so get out and don't come back!\"\n\nThe employee, Natalie Weiss, wrote on Facebook that \"when this person was leaving the store, I told them in no uncertain terms, and admittedly vulgar ones, that they were not welcome to come back.\" Weiss added that the Nebraska Family Alliance \"really is a bigoted anti-LGBT2QIA+ organization who lobbies every year for legalized discrimination against my community in my state\" and that \"apparently Cultiva would like their LGBT2QIA+ staff to understand they must serve our literal societal oppressors with a smile.\"\n\nCultiva Espresso & Crepes management wrote on Facebook that the employee in question was \"fired almost immediately\" following the incident. The management stated, \"We're proudly liberal personally, and believe in human rights and diversity to the fullest degree. Let it be known that we would * never * condone treating a customer this way.\"\n\nThe management further explained, \"We're running a business, and we try to instill professionalism in our staff, usually successfully.\" They added, \"We're more than happy to have people sit in our stores and discuss politics with civility, as has been a tradition in coffee shops for centuries. When the heat rises to this level, it's not good for anybody.\"\n\nThe management continued, \"We'd like everyone to know that * anyone * is welcome in our stores anytime, as long as they're not harassing customers or staff members, committing crimes, damaging property, etc. Whatever your race, religion, gender identity, or general political beliefs, we just want you to enjoy our food and coffee, and have a good time, and tell other people you had a good time.\"\n\nWeiss, in a subsequent Facebook post, noted, \"Cultiva Espresso & Crepes, you just let neo-conservative Trump allies drive out a trans employee.\" She added, \"So, for those keeping track, in Nebraska, you can be fired or lose your home because you identify in the LGBT2QIA+ umbrella, and you can also be fired for telling people who fight for that status quo to get lost.\"\n\nAccording to the Lincoln Journal Star, Synek said that while she believes Americans can disagree politically, she hopes the incident demonstrates the need for civility. Synek also noted that the coffee shop's owners apologized to her personally and asked her to return, the paper said.\n\n\"I've always enjoyed their coffee and crepes, and I accept their apology,\" Synek added, according to the Journal Star.",
    " Title: Former Senator John Edwards Acquitted on One Count, Mistrial Declared in Corruption Case\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Edwards, the former Democratic presidential candidate, walked out of a federal courthouse in North Carolina on Thursday afternoon following a mistrial declaration in his high-profile corruption case. The jury found him not guilty on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions but were deadlocked on the remaining five counts, leading to the mistrial decision by Judge Catherine Eagles.\n\nThe former senator was on trial for allegedly skirting campaign finance law by using contributions to keep secret his extramarital affair during the 2008 campaign. Prosecutors argued he knowingly had nearly $1 million in donations channeled to his mistress to keep her silent and prevent the affair from derailing his presidential bid. The defense argued he was merely trying to keep the secret from his wife.\n\nThe one count on which Edwards was acquitted was a charge that he received campaign contributions from wealthy donor Rachel \"Bunny\" Mellon in excess of the legal limit in 2008. Other counts were similar, though the jury could not come to an agreement.\n\nThe mistrial announcement followed a day marked by confusion and miscommunication at the North Carolina courthouse. The judge initially indicated the jury was ready to announce a verdict on all counts by mid-afternoon Thursday. However, the jury had only reached a verdict on one count. In response, the defense argued for a mistrial. But Eagles initially granted the prosecution's request to urge the jurors to resume deliberations. She later apologized for calling them into the courtroom and then sending them back for more discussions.\n\nEdwards, a former U.S. senator, had faced a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. In his emotional statement on the courthouse steps, Edwards spoke of his love for his daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, whom he fathered out of wedlock with his mistress Rielle Hunter. He also expressed his desire to continue helping children in need.\n\n\"I really believe (God) thinks there's still some good things I can do,\" Edwards said. \"Whatever happens with this legal stuff going forward, what I'm hopeful about is all those kids that I've seen, you know, in the poorest parts of this country and in some of the poorest places in the world, that I can help them, in whatever way I'm still capable of helping them.\"\n\nThe trial brought out lurid testimony from a succession of witnesses who described the behind-the-scenes drama involving Edwards' family and his staff as they began to learn of his affair. It is unclear whether federal prosecutors will seek to retry Edwards. A Justice Department spokeswoman had no immediate comment on the next step. A law enforcement official later told Fox News that it is unlikely the Justice Department would retry Edwards.",
    " Title: June Jobs Report Shatters Expectations, Media Outlets Question Report's Legitimacy Amidst Rising COVID-19 Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nThe June jobs report, released on Thursday, surpassed expectations with a gain of 4.8 million jobs and an unemployment rate of 11.1 percent. However, several broadcast network evening newscasts questioned the report's legitimacy due to the recent surge in coronavirus cases across the country.\n\nABC, CBS, and NBC collectively presented a \"reality check\" due to the report being based on data collected before the recent spike in coronavirus cases. They suggested that the economy could face another setback as a result of the ongoing pandemic.\n\nCBS Evening News anchor Margaret Brennan stated, \"The President celebrates as the economy adds nearly five million jobs, but will that work dry up as businesses are forced to shut down again?\" During two segments totaling over three minutes, Brennan emphasized that the good news came with a \"big catch.\"\n\nCorrespondent Adriana Diaz warned that the positive numbers were taken before many states experienced a resurgence in coronavirus cases. She also noted that the unemployment rates for Black and Hispanic workers were significantly higher than the national average, at 14.5 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively.\n\nWhite House correspondent Weijia Jiang, known for her critical stance towards the Trump administration, further questioned the report's legitimacy and praised Joe Biden for his criticism of the President's optimism.\n\nNBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt also expressed skepticism, stating that the record number of jobs added was \"not telling the whole story.\" White House correspondent Peter Alexander echoed this sentiment, suggesting that while Americans were returning to work faster than expected, many of the jobs added were not new positions but rather furloughed workers returning to their previous jobs.\n\nABC's World News Tonight ran a chyron during the opening teases stating, \"Recovery Reality Check.\" Weekend anchor Tom Llamas warned that while the jobs report was \"good news,\" critics were \"cautious\" due to 19 states either reversing course on reopening or pausing their reopening plans.\n\nChief business correspondent Rebecca Jarvis was slightly more balanced in her reporting, acknowledging both the record rehiring and the ongoing layoffs. She also noted that analysts expect the White House will allow the $600 weekly unemployment benefit to expire at the end of the month, although some additional stimulus may be necessary due to persistent layoffs and high unemployment rates.\n\nThese dismissals of the June jobs report were made possible by advertisers such as IBM (on ABC), Capital One (on CBS), and Liberty Mutual (on NBC).

    " Title: Senate Democrats and Republicans Disagree on Timing of Supreme Court Justice Scalia's Replacement\n\nArticle:\n\nThe passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative justice who died on Saturday in Texas, has sparked a dispute between Senate Democrats and Republicans over the timing of his replacement. The vacancy, which arises in an election year, has led to a disagreement over whether the Constitution compels President Obama to act or if the court should function with eight members until a new president is elected.\n\nSenate Democrats argue that there is no constitutional clause that prevents President Obama from nominating a replacement, while Republicans contend that the high court can function with eight members, allowing voters to shape its future. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has already ruled out a vote this year, stating that the American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice.\n\nJustice Scalia, who was 79, was found dead in his room at a West Texas resort early Saturday after he did not come out for breakfast. Known for his outspoken and often humorous demeanor, he endeared himself to conservatives during his three decades on the bench while vexing liberals who frequently disagreed with him yet admired his candor.\n\nThe debate over Justice Scalia's replacement adds a remarkable wrinkle to an already challenging year on Capitol Hill. Republicans in charge of both chambers say there are few opportunities for bipartisan agreement, though mental health care reform could be one. Instead, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, wants to put forth an agenda of \"ideas,\" offering voters a clear contrast to President Obama's agenda. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to get back to basics by passing a budget and all twelve appropriation bills in a legislative year shortened by this summer's nominating conventions and November's general elections.\n\nThe standoff has already spilled onto the campaign trail, with Senate candidates discussing the issue. Texas Senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz said his chief rival, businessman Donald Trump, could not be trusted to nominate a worthy replacement. Cruz argued that Americans' right to bear arms and other \"basic liberties\" would be at risk if President Obama is able to tilt the court toward a liberal majority.\n\nOther candidates, such as Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have also weighed in on the issue, expressing their opinions on the constitutional process for filling a Supreme Court vacancy. The debate is expected to continue as both parties jockey for position ahead of the 2016 elections.",
    " Title: Congress Frustrated as Obama Delays Request for Authorization for Use of Military Force Against ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing war against the Islamic State (ISIS) has sparked frustration among members of Congress, as President Barack Obama has yet to formally request an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). The Washington Times reports that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) expressed his discontent, stating, \"The process should come from him. He\u2019s the commander in chief. If he feels he needs this authority, he wants this authority, then he should be the leader. He should write down what he\u2019s looking for in terms of authority and let us debate it.\"\n\nSen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) also voiced his concern, stating, \"I have always felt that we should be continuing on an AUMF, but it\u2019s a little difficult when the administration doesn\u2019t produce any witnesses. So either they want an AUMF or they don\u2019t.\"\n\nFox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly, commenting on the recent beheading of Peter Kassig, 26, of Indiana by ISIS, said, \"The bad guys are winning and the president seems hesitant to do what's necessary to turn things around. He can talk all he wants. Meantime, Americans are being murdered.\"\n\nRobert Gates, Obama's former defense secretary, expressed his belief that Iraqi troops need U.S. special operations troops on the ground to defeat ISIS. The Washington Post reported Gates' statement, \"When you deny the military the authorities they require to achieve the objective, you leave them with a great sense of frustration.\"\n\nBernadette Meehan of the National Security Council told the Times that \"the administration continues to have conversations with members of both parties regarding an AUMF to suit the current fight and our current strategy against ISIS.\" However, Graham insists a written request is needed. \"I think he doesn't want to make that hard decision,\" he told the Times. \"He doesn't want to write down on a piece of paper what he would like Congress to do because he's afraid of the left.\"\n\nThe Washington Post commented that \"Mr. Obama appears to recognize the severity of the threat posed by the Islamic State (ISIS) and appears to be focused on the job of leading the fight against it. But if he continues to allow his ideological resistance to steps such as the deployment of ground forces to constrain the campaign, he will ensure its failure.\"\n\nObama has stated that a final resolution on the approach to the campaign against ISIS \"may carry over into the next Congress,\" according to The Washington Times. The New York Times argues that instead of waiting on Obama to act, Congress should take action immediately on its own. \"Increasingly, it seems as if the current lame-duck Congress will leave the issue to the next one,\" the Times wrote. \"The priority in the lame-duck session should be to pass a new and separate authorization for the war against ISIS.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Decision on Obamacare Subsidies Leaves Health Insurance Market in Limbo\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's recent reversals on maintaining Obamacare subsidies to insurers have created uncertainty about the availability and cost of health insurance for consumers when enrollment for 2018 begins in two weeks.\n\nLast week, Trump announced his administration would stop paying billions of dollars in subsidies that help insurers provide discounts to low-income households, one of several moves to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. However, Trump has since shown support and dismissed an effort by Republican and Democratic senators to reinstate the subsidies for two years, until a broader replacement for the 2010 ACA can be negotiated.\n\nBryna Koch, special projects coordinator at the Arizona Center for Rural Health, expressed concern that consumers on Obamacare plans may be confused by the back-and-forth and proposed policy changes, which could lead them to not seek assistance.\n\nTrump, who campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare, has called the subsidies a \"bailout\" for insurance companies. By law, health insurers must still offer the discounts on deductibles, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket costs, even if the government stops reimbursing them. Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies.\n\nIn anticipation of Trump's move, insurers proposed higher premiums for 2018 to recoup the lost funding. In all but a handful of states, they submitted two sets of premium rates\u2014a lower rate to use if the subsidies remained, and a higher rate to use if the funding was cut.\n\nThe fate of the subsidies remained uncertain on Thursday. A senior White House aide stated that Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, casting doubt on the prospects for the bipartisan effort to shore up insurance markets.\n\nA California court is expected to consider on Monday a request by Democratic attorneys general to keep the subsidies flowing until a legal challenge to Trump's decision is resolved. If the funding is not restored when 2018 enrollment opens on Nov. 1, many consumers will see premium rates that are on average 20 percent higher than they would have been otherwise.\n\nEven before Trump's decision on the subsidies, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted that the Republican president's policies to roll back Obamacare enrollment efforts would lead to 4 million fewer people signing up for insurance in 2018 than previously forecast. The CBO still expects 11 million people to sign up for next year\u2014an increase from this year's enrollment of 10 million.\n\nThe federal government has already halted a subsidy payment to the insurance industry for October. However, leading insurers are not yet sure whether that is the last word. Anthem Inc. Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he could not yet predict how ending the subsidies or restoring them through \"potential congressional action\" would affect pricing next year. Anthem has submitted premium rates that account for the subsidies being cut.\n\nShould the subsidies be restored at any time after Nov. 1, insurers may be able to revert to the lower monthly premium rates or provide rebates for consumers. \"A midyear change in premiums would be highly unusual, but this would be the right thing to do,\" said Marc Harrison, CEO of Intermountain Healthcare, a Utah-based health plan and hospital chain. \"Intermountain Healthcare would pursue this.\"\n\nWashington state's insurance regulator said it would allow insurers to change rates as soon as practical\u2014even the next month\u2014if lawmakers reinstate the funding, an approach backed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. However, this could run up against federal government objections, as the Affordable Care Act does not allow for changes to premium rates after they have been finalized. The administration is working to approve higher rates in several states that did not take into account Trump's cut in subsidies for 2018.",
    " Title: Hungary Declares State of Emergency, Deploys Military to Border Amid Migration Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nHungary has declared a state of emergency in two of its southeastern counties, a move that enables the deployment of the military to the border with Serbia in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants entering the country. The state of emergency grants authorities increased powers to manage the crisis, allowing them to close roads, limit the functioning of public institutions, and expedite court processes for asylum-seekers.\n\nThe state of emergency, which requires parliamentary approval for the military deployment, has already seen heavily armed military personnel, vehicles, and dogs at the border in recent days, according to Associated Press reporters.\n\nThe declaration comes as Hungary enacted tougher laws on Tuesday aimed at preventing asylum-seekers from entering the country. The legislation criminalizes attempts to breach the razor-wire fence along the border with Serbia and includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.\n\nTwo of seven border crossings with Serbia were closed Tuesday morning, and a boxcar covered with razor wire was used to close a key border crossing along a railroad track, which had been the main entry point for migrants.\n\nChaotic scenes were reported at the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as Hungarian authorities opened a temporary office to process people on the edge of no man's land, and crowds tried to enter. A small group of about 20 managed to enter, but thousands remained outside.\n\nA group of migrants also blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, stating they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary. The sit-in protest is happening on the no man's land between Roszke and Horgos, Serbia, the main border crossing between the two countries.\n\nThose who made it into Hungary the day before were boarding buses, with a Hungarian police officer confirming they were being sent directly to Austria.\n\nIn recent days, people have rushed to enter Hungary, hoping to reach Western Europe before it was too late. A record 9,380 migrants entered Hungary on Monday, surpassing the previous record of 5,809 set just a day earlier.\n\nAs of 2015, approximately 200,000 migrants have entered Hungary, with almost all entering by foot across the southern border with Serbia. However, most migrants simply transit Hungary on their way to Germany or other Western European nations.\n\nUnder the new laws, most migrants entering Hungary from Serbia can be turned away because Serbia is considered a safe country and could theoretically provide asylum. The new law also makes it a crime to damage the 4-meter razor-wire fence that Hungary has built on the 110-mile border with Serbia, giving police the power to detain anyone trying to breach it.\n\nThe state of emergency allows the government to mobilize the army, pending parliamentary approval next week, to assist police with border control. Courts are also required to prioritize cases involving migrants caught entering Hungary illegally. Police can enter and search homes where migrants who entered Hungary illegally are believed to be hiding.\n\nGermany's interior minister, Thomas de Maiziere, on Tuesday expressed support for the idea of cutting European Union funding to countries that refuse to share the burden of hosting refugees. Several EU countries, particularly those in the former Eastern bloc, have rejected calls from Germany and the EU's executive Commission for mandatory quotas to distribute refugees among the 28-nation bloc.\n\nDe Maiziere suggested that there should be discussions on how to exert pressure, stating that countries rejecting quotas often receive significant amounts of EU funding. He also mentioned that Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested reducing funding from the structural funds for such countries.",
    " Title: Local Politicians Adopt Bipartisan Approach Amid Federal Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nAcross the United States, local politicians are adopting a bipartisan approach in the face of the ongoing federal government shutdown. From New Jersey to California, Republican and Democratic officials are emulating each other's strategies to ensure the delivery of essential services to their constituents.\n\nIndiana's Republican Governor, Mike Pence, announced on Tuesday that the state will fund food stamps and welfare checks during the shutdown. In Wisconsin, Republican Governor Scott Walker, known for his battles with public sector labor unions, has removed barriers to a federally supported boat launch on the Mississippi and has stated that the state will fund state parks that were ordered shut down due to their reliance on federal funds.\n\nIn California, Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, who has been reluctant to announce plans to help those affected by the shutdown, is being praised for his fiscal conservatism. As the shutdown continues, David McCuan, political science professor at Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, California, predicts that there will be more and more \"purple ground\" at the local level.\n\n\"It's no longer the suburbs versus the cities; it's delivery of services to the people,\" McCuan says, referencing an old adage that there are no Democratic or Republican streets, only American streets. Over the long term, if the shutdown persists, McCuan anticipates this tone will rise to the national level as well, with increasing calls for moderates in both parties to find common ground.\n\nPoliticians' decisions are influenced by politics, notes government policy attorney Leonard Wolfe of Dykema in Lansing, Michigan. \"Politicians who are up for reelection want to show that they are in control of their state,\" he says, explaining that the average voter does not differentiate between the source of their government services.\n\n\"People want to know why they can't get into their parks or get their benefits check,\" Wolfe says, adding that they are not interested in partisanship. \"They expect their local politicians to be able to help,\" he says. Consequently, politicians are making gestures that signal, \"I am in control here.\"\n\nRepublican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey has released a campaign ad with the slogan, \"Compromise is not a dirty word.\" However, there are limits to how much local politicians can \"bail out\" the federal government, even when they are inclined to do so, points out Christine Kelleher-Palus, associate professor and chair of Villanova University's Department of Public Administration in Philadelphia.\n\nThe recent economic downturn has left states in a difficult position, and they are struggling in many areas due to the shutdown, Kelleher-Palus says via email. \"States are doing a lot of analyses and contingency planning \u2013 trying to figure out how individual programs are affected, and for how long they can be sustained,\" she says.\n\nPolitical analyst Barbara O'Connor, director emeritus of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State University, Sacramento, notes that New Jersey's Governor Christie has been unpredictable and that he terrifies Republicans because they can't count on him to toe the party line. However, with the safety net being threatened for an ever-widening group of constituents, O'Connor expects more politicians to be willing to do the \"helpful thing.\"\n\nIn California, Governor Brown has also been a source of unexpected moves, a trend O'Connor expects to continue. \"Remember that he is a Jesuit who lived with Mother Teresa,\" she says, referring to Brown's religious background, \"yet he has held the line on expenses and been touted for his frugality.\"\n\nThe bigger question, O'Connor says, is how more extreme politicians will respond as the shared pain spreads among constituents. \"It's an interesting drama, and we don't know how it will play out,\" she concludes.",
    " Title: Former Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis Discusses Democratic Presidential Candidates' Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, former Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1988, expressed concerns about the current state of the U.S. tax system and its impact on the Democratic party. He stated, \"When you have a tax system that is so horribly skewed and loaded with loopholes as ours has become, and big companies don't have significant taxes to pay, you're seeing a lot of Democrats asking what their party is going to do about it.\"\n\nDuring his statement, Dukakis also mentioned his support for Hillary Clinton, stating, \"The vast majority of people should be doing better in this economic recovery.\" He further commented on the struggles of both Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the current Democratic presidential candidates, to convincingly sell a vision to majorities of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, despite months of trying.\n\nSanders, who has been criticized for his tax plans and lack of foreign policy experience, has raised concerns among some Democrats that he would focus on the economy at the expense of a strong American role in the world. For his supporters, however, Sanders' vision for the party is inspiring, with Erin Bilbray, a Nevada Democrat who ran for Congress in 2014, stating that she was willing to pay more in taxes to guarantee health insurance for her children.\n\nClinton, on the other hand, faces negative feelings among some voters who see her as too close to Wall Street and too hawkish on foreign policy. In a recent poll, 55 percent of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire called Clinton the least honest candidate in the party's field, compared with 46 percent in December.",
    " Title: White House and Democrats Respond to Contempt Proceedings Against Attorney General Eric Holder\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of statements on Thursday, Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, responded to the contempt proceedings against Attorney General Eric Holder. The proceedings, initiated by Republicans, are in response to the Department of Justice's (DOJ) crackdown on state voter ID laws and the ongoing investigation into Operation Fast and Furious.\n\nRepublicans, who have voted in favor of contempt at the committee level, are seeking more than 70,000 additional documents to answer questions on Fast and Furious. The White House, through Carney, described the contempt case as a \"fishing expedition,\" while Pelosi accused Republicans of targeting Holder due to his efforts to overturn voter suppression in the states.\n\nCarney, when asked about Pelosi's claim, could not \"divine\" Republicans' motivation for pursuing the contempt case against Holder. However, he defended both Holder and President Obama for asserting executive privilege over the documents Republicans are seeking. The documents in question, according to Carney, are \"internal Executive Branch documents.\"\n\nThe executive privilege claim, which has been invoked 24 times since the presidency of Ronald Reagan, does not necessarily imply the president or White House staff were involved in the Fast and Furious discussions, according to Justice Department officials. They argued that any \"deliberative communications\" among officials in the Executive Branch could be covered by the privilege assertion.\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner suggested that the White House's decision to invoke executive privilege implies White House officials were involved in decisions that misled Congress and covered up the truth regarding Fast and Furious. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also added his name to the list of lawmakers calling for Holder's resignation.\n\nThe White House and Justice Department downplayed the potential implications of the executive privilege claim, with Justice Department officials noting that the privilege assertion does not have to pertain to communications involving the president or White House staff. Any \"deliberative communications\" among officials in the Executive Branch, they said, could be covered.",
    " Title: Lawyers for Trump Seek to Halt Release of Book Containing Allegations About Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nLawyers for U.S. President Donald Trump are attempting to prevent the release of a book containing damaging allegations about his administration. The book, \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" cites former top aide Steve Bannon as describing a meeting with a group of Russians as \"treasonous.\" The book also portrays Mr. Trump as being surprised at winning the presidency.\n\nDespite the legal threat, the book's publishers have brought its release forward. Initially scheduled for Tuesday, the book's author, Michael Wolff, announced that it would now be available for purchase on Friday. The White House has disputed the book's accuracy. Mr. Trump earlier stated that Mr. Bannon, who was dismissed in August, had \"lost his mind\" after losing his White House position.\n\nAmong a number of explosive statements, Mr. Bannon reportedly said, referring to a Trump Tower meeting between top campaign officials and Russia, \"They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV.\" The meeting, which involved Mr. Trump's eldest child Donald Trump Jr., is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia to win the election.\n\nOn his Breitbart radio show on Wednesday, Mr. Bannon responded to the president's criticism by saying he was a \"great man\" and that he supported him \"day in and day out.\" After the president met Republican senators in the Oval Office to discuss immigration on Thursday, a reporter asked Mr. Trump if his former strategist had betrayed him. He responded, \"I don't know, he called me a great man last night so he obviously changed his tune pretty quick.\"\n\nThe legal notice, which has been published by the Washington Post, demands that author Michael Wolff and the book's publisher \"immediately cease and desist from any further publication, release or dissemination of the book.\" It accuses Wolff of making \"numerous false and/or baseless statements\" about Mr. Trump and says lawyers are considering pursuing libel charges.\n\nThe lawyers base their notice on excerpts of the book published in publications including New York Magazine and ask for a full copy of the book to be sent to them. The letter says the book \"appears to cite to [sic] no sources for many of its most damaging statements about Mr. Trump\" and that many claims are made without citing sources. Neither Wolff nor the publisher, Henry Holt and Co Inc, have yet responded.\n\nThe attorney who wrote the letter, Charles J. Harder, has been called Hollywood's favorite lawyer. He represents Jared Kushner, and represented wrestler Hulk Hogan in his case against now-defunct news website Gawker. Mr. Harder also briefly represented disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein. He sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mr. Bannon on Wednesday, saying he had violated a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nThe book is reportedly based on more than 200 interviews, but some of the book's excerpts have already been criticized and questioned. Still, even if only half of what the book contains is true, it paints a damning portrait of a paranoid president and a chaotic White House, according to BBC North America editor Jon Sopel.\n\nDonald Trump might want to familiarize himself with the so-called Streisand Effect. The lesson, most prominently learned by singer Barbra Streisand when she tried to quash photographs of her home that appeared on an obscure website, is that the more you fight against undesirable news, the more you call attention to it.\n\nThanks to his lawyer's \"cease and desist\" letter, Mr. Trump is giving Michael Wolff and his explosive book the kind of massive publicity boost money alone can't buy. The highly critical allegations are leading every news program and newspaper front page (and burying the latest round of glowing U.S. economic news that might otherwise garner attention).\n\nThreatening lawsuits is a common tactic for Mr. Trump, dating back to his days as a New York real estate mogul. Very seldom does he follow up with actual court action. In this case, such a move would be particularly risky. To meet the \"actual malice\" requirement of U.S. libel law, the president would open himself up to investigation from opposing lawyers seeking to prove that Wolff's allegations had substance\u2014or, at the very least, that he had reason to believe they did.\n\n\"Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,\" Mr. Trump said in a statement on Wednesday. Press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed the book as a \"trashy tabloid fiction\" that she said was \"filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Melania Trump said the First Lady had encouraged her husband's presidential bid. \"She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did,\" she said on Wednesday. On Thursday, the White House said it was banning personal devices, including mobile phones, from the West Wing, citing security concerns.\n\nIn researching the book, Wolff said he had been able to take up \"something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing\" following the president's inauguration.",
    " Title: National Security Advisor McMaster Allegedly Linked to George Soros, According to Multiple Intelligence Sources\n\nArticle:\n\nThree separate domestic and foreign intelligence sources have reported that National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster is an active operative of globalist billionaire George Soros. The allegations suggest that McMaster is a foreign intelligence agent for a multi-national combine controlled by Soros, which may explain his perceived efforts to obstruct President Trump's agenda.\n\nRoger Stone, a correspondent for \u2588\u2588\u2588, reported that he has received confirmation from sources within the White House, the Israeli government, and Israeli intelligence that General McMaster has been communicating with George Soros, providing him with information about what is happening inside the White House. Stone claims to have verified this information with two different high-level sources within Israeli intelligence, and expects the Israeli ambassador to the US to confirm it.\n\nThe implication of this allegation is that McMaster is a primary leaker, given Soros' extensive ties to the mainstream media. It is already known that McMaster was a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an organization that was funded by Soros' Open Society Foundation and another Soros-financed group.\n\nLast month, Israel publicly accused Soros of undermining democratically-elected governments. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized Soros when it spoke out against the vandalism of anti-Soros posters in Hungary, which were defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti. The Ministry stated that it deplores any expression of anti-Semitism in any country and stands with Jewish communities everywhere in confronting this hatred. However, the statement also criticized Soros for continuously undermining Israel's democratically elected governments by funding organizations that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself.\n\nSoros began infiltrating the National Security Council as early as May when his operative Fiona Hill, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Soros-funded Eurasia Foundation, joined its staff. Stone reported that Soros has planted a mole in the National Security apparatus in the form of Fiona Hill, who has a Harvard background and has been on the Soros payroll and the payroll of the Open Society Institute.\n\nHill has been associated with the Soros-founded Central European University (CEU) in Hungary, which has tried to influence the Hungarian government, which has defiantly refused EU migrant quotas and Soros' meddling in its affairs. CEU's rector, Michael Ignatieff, stated that they received unequivocal support from Hill's team at the National Security Council. Ignatieff also noted that there is a tiny ledge of commonality between Republicans and Democrats, and academic freedom is one issue that unites them both.\n\nHowever, it is unlikely that \"academic freedom\" exists at CEU, given that it was founded by Soros, a globalist socialist known for bankrolling institutions that promote his political agenda. It is also no secret that academic institutions are routinely used to steer government policies as part of the interconnected, globalist network of academia, technology, government, and media.",
    " Title: Potential Executive Actions on Gun Control by Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration has hinted at taking executive actions on gun control and gun-related violence, prompting questions about the specific measures they might implement without Congressional approval.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, one potential action could involve strengthening the FBI's background check database. Currently, federal agencies that do not contribute to the database, such as the Social Security Administration, have access to mental competence information about prospective gun buyers, or details about failed drug tests and other issues that might prevent a sale to the wrong person. The president could also demand that states share more information from their crime and mental-health databases.\n\nThe Hill reports that the specific executive orders Obama is considering are unclear, but a Democratic aide familiar with the discussions suggests that the president could bypass Congress and bolster federally funded mental-health programs.\n\nThe coalition of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, led by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has called for Obama to consider several measures that they claim can be implemented without congressional approval. These include stepping up prosecution by the Justice Department of felons and others prohibited from buying weapons when they attempt to do so, requiring federal agencies to report records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and appointing an ATF director. The federal agency charged with enforcing gun laws has been without a confirmed director for six years.\n\nThe Times adds that most changes to the current system, which allows easy access to weapons with hugely destructive power, will likely require legislation.\n\nFollowing the Dec. 14 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Vice President Biden was tasked with presenting \"concrete proposals\" on reducing gun violence this month. Among the groups he is due to meet with today is the National Rifle Association.\n\nUpdate at 12:35 p.m. ET: Biden Sees Recommendations Coming On Universal Background Checks And High-Capacity Magazines:\n\nAt the White House a short time ago, Biden stated that there has been broad agreement among the groups he has met with so far that a system of \"universal background checks\" for gun purchasers needs to be established. Additionally, he said, there has been broad agreement for controls on high-capacity ammunition magazines. Based on past statements from NRA leaders, it is unlikely they are among those Biden is speaking about when he talks of agreement on these issues.",
    " Title: Pete Buttigieg Launches Bid for Democratic Presidential Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nPete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has officially entered the race for the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2020 presidential election. At his launch event in South Bend, Buttigieg outlined his vision for a \"re-imagined future\" and differentiated himself from President Donald Trump's politics.\n\nShould Buttigieg secure the nomination, he would become the first openly gay U.S. president. At 37, he is the youngest candidate in a crowded field that includes Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (77) and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (69). Despite his relative inexperience, the former Rhodes Scholar has gained momentum in recent weeks, moving from the margins to the front of the pack.\n\nIn his campaign, Buttigieg has focused on gun control, climate change, LGBT rights, and other progressive issues he hopes will appeal to millennial voters. His tenure as mayor of South Bend, during which the city's economy has improved, has also earned him praise. Since announcing his presidential run in January, Buttigieg has raised over $7 million in funds in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nOpinion polls in Iowa and New Hampshire last week placed Buttigieg third in both states, behind Bernie Sanders and former Vice-President Joe Biden. Sanders launched his campaign last month, while Biden, who has faced allegations of inappropriate touching by several women, has yet to announce his candidacy.\n\nAt the rally, Buttigieg sought to differentiate himself from his rivals as a candidate taking the \"long view,\" especially on issues such as climate change. \"I recognize the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor,\" he said. \"More than a little bold\u2026 But we live in a moment that compels us each to act. The forces changing our country today are tectonic.\"\n\nMore than a dozen candidates are running to be the Democratic Party's candidate for the presidential election in November 2020. The process of selecting a nominee will begin early next year.\n\nBorn in South Bend in 1982, Buttigieg studied at Harvard and Oxford, graduating from the latter in 2007 with first-class honors in philosophy, politics, and economics. He worked as a consultant at McKinsey & Company between 2007 and 2010 and served for seven months in Afghanistan as a Navy reservist in 2014. At 29, he was elected mayor of South Bend, taking office in January 2012.\n\nDespite an unsuccessful run for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, former President Barack Obama name-checked Buttigieg as a rising star. The video announcing he will run for president focuses on his role in South Bend's redevelopment and takes aim at corruption and infighting in Washington.\n\nButtigieg came out as gay in 2015 and married Chasten Glezman, a middle school teacher, last year. In his rally speech, Buttigieg positioned himself as the voice of millennials. Critics say his campaign has so far emphasized values and his personal story rather than a distinctive policy agenda.\n\nTougher action on climate change, including the so-called \"Green New Deal\" proposals, and passing the Federal Equality Act, legislation that would give federal non-discrimination protections to LGBT people, are among Buttigieg's key policy priorities. The race to stop Donald Trump's re-election is underway, and many other candidates are vying for the Democratic Party's nomination.",
    " Title: Trump's Misleading Statements at Coronavirus Briefing\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump continued his pattern of false and misleading claims during a coronavirus briefing on Friday, as the number of confirmed cases in the United States surpassed 100,000. Here is a developing roundup of some of the President's statements and their factual inaccuracies:\n\n1. The real state of the stock market 22 days ago\nTrump claimed that 22 days ago, \"everything was going beautifully\" before the US was hit by the coronavirus. He said, \"22 days ago we had the greatest economy in the world, everything was going beautifully, the stock market hit an all-time high.\"\n\nFacts First: While the market had previously set all-time records under Trump, on March 5, 22 days before Trump's comments, the Dow dropped 3.6% or 970 points, then its fifth-worst single-day point drop on record, adding to a 3,000-point drop since its peak on February 12.\n\n2. The current situation is unprecedented and unforeseen\nThroughout Friday's press briefing, the President claimed the current situation was unprecedented and unforeseen. He said, \"In all fairness to all of the former presidents, none of them ever thought a thing like this could happen.\"\n\nFacts First: This is false. The US intelligence community and public health experts had warned for years that the country was at risk from a pandemic.\n\n3. Suggesting General Motors should manufacture ventilators\nAs he did on Twitter earlier on Friday, Trump suggested at the briefing that General Motors should manufacture ventilators at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio.\n\n4. Calling the coronavirus a germ, flu, or virus\nTrump said, \"You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus, you know you can call it many different names. I'm not sure anybody even knows what it is.\"\n\nFacts First: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Thursday that the coronavirus is \"very much more transmissible than flu and more importantly, it's significantly more serious\" with a mortality rate approximately 10 times higher than the 0.1% for the flu.\n\n5. Claiming thousands of ventilators were sent to New York and they were unaware\nTrump said, \"We sent thousands of ventilators to New York and they did not know about it at the time, they were complaining.\" Trump also said at the briefing that New York had been unaware of thousands of ventilators sitting in \"a warehouse.\"\n\nFacts First: There is no evidence that New York did not know ventilators had arrived from the federal government when Gov. Andrew Cuomo was demanding additional ventilators.\n\n6. Claiming China pays 25% interest on $250 billion worth of product that they send in\nTrump said, \"China pays 25% interest on $250 billion worth of product that they send in.\"\n\nFacts First: Trump was inaccurately describing his 25% tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese products. A tariff is not the same as \"interest.\" It is a tax paid by the importer, not a charge paid by an entity that has borrowed money.",
    " Title: President Obama Clarifies Red Line Statement on Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference in Stockholm on Wednesday, President Barack Obama clarified his statement regarding a \"red line\" on the use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\n\"First of all, I did not set a red line,\" the President said. \"The world set a red line.\" He explained that the world set a red line when governments representing 98% of the world's population condemned the use of chemical weapons and passed a treaty forbidding their use, even during war.\n\nCongress, according to Obama, also set a red line by ratifying the treaty and passing the Syria Accountability Act, which indicated that certain atrocities happening in Syria needed to be addressed.\n\nThe President further clarified that the international community's credibility, as well as America and Congress's credibility, is at stake in the Syria vote. He stated, \"My credibility is not on the line. The international community's credibility is on the line. And America and Congress's credibility is on the line because we give lip service to the notion that these international norms are important.\"\n\nThe President's comments come as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a Syria use-of-force resolution on Wednesday, but only by a close 10-7 vote. President Obama lost two Democrats and five Republicans, including Senators John Barrasso of Wyoming and Marco Rubio of Florida, who are not typically considered isolationists.\n\nThe President's comments suggest that he believes America is the enforcer of world order, and that there is no substitute for the President of the United States. However, he has yet to fully grasp, according to the article, that he must lead and cannot default to the international community or Congress. If he loses on Syria, it will be because he has not led effectively.",
    " Title: California's SB 50 Fails for Third Time in State Senate Amidst Opposition from NIMBYs and Housing Justice Advocates\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia's contentious housing bill, SB 50, failed to pass out of the state Senate for the third time on Thursday, falling three votes short. The bill, which aimed to revolutionize land use and housing in the state, has been a subject of debate in the state legislature for several years. The opposition, primarily from lawmakers representing the Los Angeles area, was a significant factor in the bill's failure.\n\nWhile many attribute the bill's defeat to the NIMBYs (Not In My Back Yard) who opposed top-down control and intrusion into their neighborhoods, the opposition was more complex. Housing justice groups, concerned about the bill's potential impact on low-income residents and its lack of protection for them, emerged as a significant and deeply entrenched opposition.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that the NIMBYs and housing justice advocates, despite sharing common ground in their opposition to SB 50, have different goals and motivations. While NIMBYs aim to prevent major development and sometimes low-income housing in their neighborhoods, housing justice advocates focus on addressing the displacement of low-income communities and communities of color in the development process.\n\nThis distinction is important as California lawmakers prepare to reintroduce housing production legislation. While NIMBYs may remain resistant to development near them, resistant housing justice advocates might cooperate if they feel the policy will help and not hurt vulnerable communities. Conflating the two factions overlooks the real concerns about the widening wealth and affordability gap in the state.\n\nFollowing the SB 50 vote, Senate President pro Tempore Toni Atkins, bill author Senator Scott Wiener, and Governor Gavin Newsom have affirmed their intention to reintroduce housing production legislation. Senator Wiener has already introduced two housing policy spot bills on Thursday, and the Assembly is currently considering legislation that guarantees a legal right to housing for families and children.\n\nSenator Atkins, who supported SB 50, challenged the bill's critics to put forward their own legislation on Thursday, stating, \"The opponents of SB 50 have real concerns, but have offered no substantive alternative with the same kind of scope of SB 50.\" The housing crisis in California is not going away and will remain a legislative focus over the next year and beyond.",
    " Title: Silicon Valley-Backed Political Advocacy Group FWD.us Launches, Focuses on Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has been anticipated for weeks, the political advocacy group FWD.us, backed by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, officially launched on Thursday. The group, whose name stands for Forward U.S., has a list of top Silicon Valley CEOs and a team of strategists.\n\nThe 11 founders of FWD.us include Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, and John Doerr, the venture capitalist who has backed Google and Amazon.com. Notable contributors include Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's chief executive, and Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman.\n\nThe group has enlisted political players from both sides of the aisle, including Rob Jesmer, a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee; Dan Senor, who also served as Rep. Paul Ryan's chief adviser during his vice presidential run; and Joe Lockhart, former White House press secretary for President Bill Clinton. Jef Pollock, the Democratic pollster, and Alida Garcia, former Latino vote deputy director for the Obama 2012 campaign, are also part of the team.\n\nIn an op-ed in The Washington Post on Thursday, Zuckerberg wrote about meeting a middle school student who is an undocumented immigrant and uncertain about his ability to attend college due to his immigration status. He expressed his concern about the current immigration policy, stating, \"We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants, and it's a policy unfit for today's world.\"\n\nThe group's exact actions are yet to be determined, but they may include ads, campaign support, public communications, and grass-roots organizing, according to a source familiar with the organization. The group's website features testimonials from its members.\n\nLast week, the group's co-founder and president, Joe Green, issued an apology after a leaked prospectus listed as members the names of executives who had not committed to the effort. The prospectus also included phrases that were criticized, such as \"Human Capital\" and an assessment that the group's members control \"massive distribution channels.\" Green expressed regret over some of the document's phrases.\n\nWith its official unveiling, FWD.us will focus its initial efforts on the passage of comprehensive immigration reform. Tech companies are pushing for an increase in the number of H-1B temporary visas for high-skilled foreign workers and a reduction in green card wait times for their workers.",
    " Title: Congressional Republicans Unveil $1.4 Trillion Tax-Cut Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Republicans have officially unveiled their final $1.4 trillion-plus tax-cut plan, which includes significant reductions in corporate and individual tax rates, the winding down of certain credits and exemptions, and the imposition of new international tax rules. The plan, which is the result of months of work and negotiations among Republicans, aims for quick passage next week.\n\nThe plan, known as the conference report, lowers the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. This reduction is being billed as the biggest corporate tax rate reduction in U.S. history. The plan preserves the existing number of individual tax rates at seven, not counting the zero rate, and lowers the top rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent.\n\nThe new top rate applies to individuals making more than $500,000 and couples making more than $600,000. Under current law, the top rate of 39.6 percent applies to individuals making more than $418,400 and couples making more than $470,700. The new individual rates are effective for 2018, but are set to expire after 2025, a move Republicans used to keep the plan's overall price tag within the $1.5 trillion limit set by fast-track budget rules.\n\nThe bill also roughly doubles the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families, increasing the number of \"zero filers\" who face no federal income tax liability and the amount of income not subject to taxation for those who opt to take the standard deduction.\n\nThe plan preserves the current mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages but imposes a $750,000 cap for future mortgages. It also preserves the existing deduction for charitable contributions.\n\nThe bill repeals Obamacare's individual mandate starting in 2019, an item added during the negotiating process as lawmakers hunted for revenue sources they could use to pay for other rate cuts. It also doubles the current exemption for the estate tax on inheritances from $5 million to $10 million, so fewer people will be affected.\n\nFor small businesses, there is a new 20 percent deduction that applies to the first $315,000 of joint income for so-called \"pass-through\" companies that file their taxes as individuals. For income above that level, there's a deduction for up to 20 percent on profits, a move tax-writers estimate would reduce marginal tax rates to a maximum of 29.6 percent.\n\nBusinesses will also be able to immediately write off capital expenses for new equipment, rather than the current system that has them do it over a number of years.\n\nThe bill repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, which is intended to make sure all companies pay at least some tax, and raises the income thresholds for the individual alternative minimum tax.\n\nThe state and local tax deduction, which had been on the chopping block at the start of the process, was preserved in part. People can now take a deduction of up to a total of $10,000 for sales, income, and property taxes paid.\n\nThe plan also doubles the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000, and makes $1,400 of it refundable against payroll taxes. This change was sought by Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Lee, among others, in order to reach more families that may not make enough to pay federal income taxes.\n\nOn the international side, the bill imposes a 15.5 percent \"repatriation\" tax for cash holdings that companies have parked overseas, and an 8 percent tax for non-cash holdings.\n\nWhile Republicans are looking for swift passage next week, Democrats have criticized the package, stating that it is tilted toward corporations and the wealthy and doesn't do enough for the middle class. \"This tax bill is a moral and economic obscenity,\" said Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont Independent. \"It is a gift to wealthy Republican campaign contributors and an insult to the working families of our country.\"",
    " Title: Former Russian Ambassador to U.S. Denies Significance of Meetings with Sessions, Downplays Extent of Interactions with Trump's Inner Circle\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview aired on Russian state-owned television, former Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak stated that it would take over 20 minutes to list every discussion he had with people close to President Trump. Kislyak made the comment in jest during an interview on Wednesday, after being asked to name every person associated with Mr. Trump he had either met with or spoken to on the phone.\n\nKislyak, 67, served as Moscow's ambassador to Washington from 2008 until August 2017, and in September he was elected to represent Mordovia in the Russian legislature's upper chamber. During his tenure in D.C., Kislyak made a lasting impression, particularly among Democrats on Capitol Hill who have continued to scrutinize his meetings with people close to Mr. Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions testified during his January confirmation hearing in the Senate that he \"did not have communications with the Russians\" while serving as a surrogate for Mr. Trump's campaign. However, during Tuesday's hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Sessions admitted to meeting with Kislyak at least twice during the 2016 campaign.\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) stated, \"That is exactly the opposite answer you gave under oath to the U.S. Senate. Either you're lying to the U.S. Senate or you're lying to the U.S. House of Representatives.\" Sessions responded, \"My story has never changed. I have always told the truth.\"\n\nSpeaking on Russian television the next day, Kislyak downplayed the significance of his meetings with Sessions. \"In not one meeting, not with Sessions, not with anyone else, did we use any kinds of techniques or arguments that I would not be able to speak about publicly,\" Kislyak said.\n\nKislyak added, \"This is no longer about me. This isn't about contacts with us. This is a war that's going on between the opponents of the president, the president and everyone surrounding him.\"\n\nSeparate from Sessions, other members of Mr. Trump's campaign, transition team, and administration have come under scrutiny in recent months for meeting with Kislyak prior to the president's inauguration. Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, resigned from that role in February after it emerged that he discussed lifting sanctions against Russia with Kislyak prior to Mr. Trump's inauguration and then to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of those talks.\n\nJared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, reportedly spoke with Kislyak during the transition period about establishing a secret back channel between the White House and Kremlin.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have determined that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the 2016 White House race in hopes of electing Mr. Trump over his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Russia's alleged involvement in the race and any collusion between Moscow and Mr. Trump's inner circle are currently being investigated by probes underway in the House, Senate, and Department of Justice, including a probe led by DOJ-appointed special counsel Robert Mueller that has resulted in criminal charges so far for three members of Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nRussia has denied meddling in the U.S. election, and the White House has denied colluding with the Kremlin.",
    " Title: Manchin Says Lack of Votes for Expanded Background Checks Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III (D-WV) has stated that proponents of a measure to expand gun-purchase background checks to online and gun show sales do not have the necessary votes to pass the bill on Wednesday. This setback for gun-control advocates comes after the Connecticut shooting rampage, where they had hoped for more ambitious controls, such as bans on certain types of weapons and magazines, and universal background checks on all gun sales.\n\nPresident Obama has been actively promoting the administration's package, which was crafted by Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who has been Mr. Obama's point man on the issue. On MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Sen. Manchin expressed optimism, stating, \"If we just had 20 percent of our Republican colleagues\u2014that\u2019s not a heavy ask; that\u2019s not a heavy lift\u2014only 20 percent, that\u2019s nine members, nine members. This thing would be home.\"\n\nSen. Manchin's spokesman, Jonathan Kott, stated that Mr. Manchin remains optimistic that if senators read the bill, they will support it. So far, Sen. Manchin has managed to garner support from an A-rated NRA member and three Republican senators, as well as 90 percent of his own party.\n\nSen. Manchin expressed uncertainty about the bill's passage on the Senate floor Wednesday, stating, \"I feel good. I feel I\u2019m here for this purpose. Whatever happens today will happen. I feel we\u2019ve done a good job, and I just ask my colleagues to consider this before we vote sometime this afternoon.\"\n\nThe prospects for the amendment have significantly faded Wednesday as Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) both announced they would not support it. Both senators had voted to move debate forward on the underlying legislation last week, which includes more far-reaching background-check language, stiff penalties for gun trafficking and straw purchasing, and provisions intended to bolster school safety.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has scheduled votes on eight other amendments to the underlying gun legislation, including bans on certain types of guns and magazines. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and other co-sponsors unveiled a substitute amendment Wednesday morning, intended to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and address mental health and school safety, among other provisions.\n\nSen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) also announced his own amendment, intended to replace the background-check provision from Sens. Manchin and Patrick J. Toomey (R-PA), that would allow people to conduct self-checks through a consumer portal, among other measures. Sen. Coburn stated that the amendment's provisions, which anger special-interest groups on both sides, is a sign of its strength.",
    " Title: Gun-Rights Group Challenges Pennsylvania's Closure of Gun Stores Amidst Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nA top gun-rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC), has filed a case with the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, challenging Democratic Governor Tom Wolf's inclusion of gun stores in a statewide shutdown of \"non-essential\" businesses due to the coronavirus outbreak. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has asked Governor Wolf to respond to the arguments in the case by 8 p.m. on Friday.\n\nBrandon Combs, president of the FPC, stated that his group filed the case on Friday, aiming to block Governor Wolf from ordering gun stores to close. Combs argued, \"Weapons and ammunition retailers are one of the most essential business types in the United States.\" He further stated, \"There is no \u2018 except in emergencies\u2019 clause in the Constitution, and the government cannot shut down the people\u2019s right to keep and bear arms.\"\n\nGovernment mandates shuttering businesses in several states, including California and Pennsylvania, have raised concerns that more gun retailers could be ordered to close. At least one gun store near San Jose has been forced to close, according to a Mercury News report.\n\nGun-rights advocates argue that Americans' access to firearms and ammunition should not be prohibited during the pandemic. Amy Hunter, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association (NRA), stated, \"They [retailers] are required by the government to be a point of access to the exercise of fundamental human rights.\"\n\nAs fears of the pandemic increase and police in major cities announce they will no longer make arrests over certain crimes, Americans have flooded gun stores and online ammunition dealers in recent weeks. A shutdown of gun stores would drastically limit their ability to purchase firearms for self-defense.\n\nGun-rights groups, including the FPC and the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF), have stated they will challenge any attempts to curb gun sales in court if lawmakers attempt to do so. Amy Hunter of the NRA stated, \"Law-abiding Americans must not be deprived of the right to defend themselves and their loved ones at any time.\"\n\nAlan Gottlieb, founder of the SAF, stated, \"Gun prohibitionists want to close down every gun store they can and will use any means necessary.\" He acknowledged that finding a case likely to succeed in court could take time due to several challenges for Second Amendment supporters in the courts.\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun industry's trade group, is also monitoring the situation and is prepared to intervene if necessary. Mark Oliva, a spokesman for the group, stated, \"We're monitoring how our businesses are going to be affected as governors start to say we're going to shut down non-essential businesses.\" He added, \"We believe our businesses are essential. We're starting to get ready to defend that if we have to.\"",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Hillary Clinton's Approval Ratings Dropping in Key States Amid Email Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll released by Quinnipiac University on Tuesday indicates that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is trailing in key states, including Florida and Pennsylvania, amidst the ongoing controversy surrounding her use of a private email account during her tenure as Secretary of State.\n\nIn the Sunshine State, Clinton trails former Florida Governor Jeb Bush by a narrow margin, with a 45% to 47% lead. In February, Clinton led Bush by a 10-point margin. The same poll shows Clinton with a 1-point lead over Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in Pennsylvania, a must-win state for the Democrats. In February, Clinton led Paul by 10 points.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll also reveals a decline in Clinton's favorability ratings in both states. Her favorability rating in Florida dropped by 4 points, while in Pennsylvania, it dropped by 6 points.\n\nPeter A. Brown, the pollster for Quinnipiac University, attributed the decline in Clinton's ratings to the ongoing email controversy, stating that it is \"taking a toll\" on her public image.\n\nRepublicans have seized on the email controversy to tarnish Clinton's image and raise questions about her trustworthiness. On Tuesday, the GOP chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi requested an interview with Clinton before May 1 to discuss her use of a private email account at the State Department and reports that she wiped her private server clean.\n\nClinton is expected to announce her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election later this month. The field of potential Republican challengers is growing, with Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) being the first to formally enter the race last week, and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) expected to announce their candidacies soon.\n\nThe deep bench of potential Republican challengers, which also includes Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, is emboldening Republicans.\n\n\"I think people are feeling optimistic, and it's really based on our candidates and our plan and vision for the future,\" said Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.). \"I think our country is really ready for a change.\"\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, warned that the Republican party could fumble its chance by becoming embroiled in internecine warfare or failing to reach out to Hispanic voters, an increasingly crucial bloc in presidential elections.\n\n\"We have to show we can govern,\" he said. \"There's one other issue, and that's immigration reform.\"\n\nThe email controversy has also revived interest in the Benghazi panel, with Republicans hoping to make a case against Clinton's character. The Quinnipiac poll shows 50% of voters in Florida say Clinton is not honest or trustworthy, while only 41% say she is. Her favorability rating in the state is 49% positive, down 4 points from a month ago.\n\nRon Kaufman, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, said the email controversy raises questions of trustworthiness.\n\n\"I do believe the two twin killers in politics that hurt people more than anything else are arrogance and hypocrisy. They kill people,\" he said. \"Everybody knows she's being totally arrogant \u2014 'I'll decide myself how I'll handle my emails.' The hypocrisy of pretending to be transparent really hurts her.\"\n\nDemocrats argue that Clinton maintains a sizable lead in the polls and predict that GOP candidates will begin to get into their own trouble as the race gears up.\n\n\"There's not one person right now, when you match them head to head, who is even in Clinton's weight class,\" said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist.\n\nAdrienne Watson, the communications director for Correct The Record, a group dedicated to defending Clinton, accused Republicans of reveling in political inanity.\n\n\"Secretary Clinton is talking about the future; about better jobs for working and middle-class Americans, Republicans are talking about a poll a year and a half before Election Day because they have no plan for America's future,\" she said.\n\n\"Manufactured scandals, politicizing an American tragedy like Benghazi and wanting into a person's personal emails will not work for the Republican politicians,\" she added.\n\nClinton has a major advantage over potential Republican opponents in that she faces a lightly contested path to the nomination. She has a huge lead over all likely Democratic candidates, according to polls.\n\n\"No amount of money or organization is going to erase Jeb Bush's family name or his brother's legacy,\" Mollineau said. \"As much as he says he's his own man, it seems the advisers he's collecting are a redux of the Bush-Cheney administration.\"",
    " Title: Sydney Cafe Siege: Gunman Takes Hostages in Central Sydney, Police Negotiating\n\nArticle:\n\nA gunman took an unknown number of hostages in a cafe in the central business district of Sydney, Australia, on Monday, prompting a city-wide lockdown and a six-hour standoff with police. The siege ended early Tuesday morning when armed officers stormed the cafe and gunshots were heard. The status of the hostage taker, identified as Man Haron Monis, an Iranian, is unclear.\n\nThe Lindt Chocolate Cafe, located near the state parliament, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the headquarters of two of Australia's largest banks, was the site of the incident. About a dozen people are believed to remain in the cafe, with dozens of buildings in the area evacuated due to police receiving information about up to four potential bombs around the city.\n\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott stopped short of labeling the hostage taking a terrorist attack but described it as politically motivated. \"This is a very disturbing incident,\" Mr. Abbott said. \"It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation.\"\n\nNew South Wales police commissioner Andrew Scipione stated that the police's priority was to safely evacuate the hostages. \"Our plan, our only goal tonight and for as long as this takes, is to get those people that are currently caught in that building, out of there safely,\" he said.\n\nThe hostage taker reportedly displayed a black and white flag with the Shahada, a general expression of Islamic faith, in the cafe's windows. The use of the Shahada flag suggests the hostage taker may be responding to calls by Islamic State to carry out attacks, according to Professor Greg Barton of Monash University in Melbourne.\n\nWorld leaders, including Stephen Harper of Canada, David Cameron of Britain, and Narendra Modi of India, conveyed messages of support. Local Muslim leaders swiftly condemned the hostage taking, with Australia's Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, stating that the Islamic community was devastated by the incident.\n\nThe Sydney siege bears similarities to recent attacks in Ottawa and Montreal, according to Justin Hastings, a senior lecturer in international relations at the University of Sydney. \"These are attacks that send a very strong message that there are terrorists among us and they're very difficult to stop precisely because there is not much planning involved,\" he said.\n\nMore than 70 Australians are believed to be fighting for Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, and a similar number have had their passports cancelled to prevent them from traveling to conflict zones in the Middle East.",
    " Title: Pope Francis' Unconventional Motorcade: The Symbolism of the Black Fiat\n\nArticle:\n\nPope Francis, the first pontiff to address a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress, has captured the attention of Washington D.C. not only for his historic speeches but also for his unique mode of transportation - a small, black Fiat.\n\nBill Newbrough, 51, and his colleagues stood on the sidewalk, discussing the car. \"This is Washington, after all, and this motorcade is slightly different from the ones we've seen before,\" he said, referring to the compact Fiat that navigated the city streets with ease.\n\nStephen Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies at The Catholic University of America, expressed his admiration for the car. \"It looks like a clown car when they all get in it, but it's just such a perfect metaphor for his message,\" he said.\n\nPope Francis' preference for a modest vehicle aligns with his vow of poverty taken when he became a Jesuit priest. Although no longer bound by this vow as a bishop, it remains an important aspect of his life, according to Schneck.\n\nIn the past, popemobiles became large and bulletproof after the 1981 assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II. However, Francis has reverted to the Fiat and a specialized Jeep with open sides, as noted by The Washington Post in a retrospective of 215 years of popemobiles.\n\nIn an interview with the Spanish daily La Vanguardia, Pope Francis explained that he prefers a more open and approachable vehicle, stating, \"It's true that anything could happen, but let's face it: At my age, I don't have much to lose.\"\n\nSchneck attributes the choice of the Fiat to Francis' message of humility and his call for Catholics to focus on the marginalized members of society. Alejandro Ca\u00f1adas, a professor of economics at Mount St. Mary's University, who has known the pope since his days in Argentina, agrees.\n\nThe name Fiat holds religious significance, as it appears in the Bible in Luke 1:38, where Mary responds to the angel Gabriel with the phrase \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word.\" In Latin, fiat translates roughly to \"let it be done,\" and for Catholics, this line is known as Mary's fiat.\n\nCa\u00f1adas suggests that the pope's choice of the Fiat reflects his attempt to emulate the Virgin Mary and live a life of humility and service to the marginalized.\n\nBack on Pennsylvania Avenue, the pope's motorcade made its way through the city, with the black Fiat nestled among the black SUVs. The simple, unassuming car, with its windows down and the pope waving, served as a tangible symbol of Francis' commitment to humility and accessibility.",
    " Title: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Defends Support for Cost-of-Living Increases for Members of Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) defended her stance on cost-of-living increases for members of Congress on Tuesday, stating that voting against such increases makes campaign finance reform more difficult. She argued that refusing a cost-of-living increase serves to \"punish members who rely on a straight salary, and reward those who rely on money loopholes and other forms of self-dealing.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets, Ocasio-Cortez explained that voting against cost-of-living increases creates pressure on members of Congress to keep \"dark money loopholes\" open. She also emphasized that all workers, including minimum wage workers, should receive cost-of-living increases, and suggested that worker co-ops and collective bargaining are other forums in which worker pay increases can be voted on.\n\nOn Monday, House Democrats withdrew a spending bill that would have provided raises to members of Congress for the first time in a decade due to pushback from swing state lawmakers. Ocasio-Cortez has been vocal on living wage issues and campaign finance reform.",
    " Title: Business Executives Puzder and Tillerson Face Mixed Reception in Democratic Circles\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees, Andrew Puzder and Rex Tillerson, have received a mixed response from the Democratic party, with their business backgrounds being a source of both concern and praise.\n\nAndrew Puzder, chosen to lead the Department of Labor, is the head of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Hardee's and Carl's Jr. fast-food chains. Puzder, who has experience in hiring and managing employees, has expressed opposition to significant increases in the minimum wage, a stance that has drawn criticism from some Democrats.\n\nIn a 2016 article, Puzder wrote, \"The fight for dramatic minimum-wage increases could leave millions with no wage at all.\" This viewpoint aligns with standard economic theory, as expressed by Nobel laureate Paul Krugman in 1998, who criticized those who believe that the price of labor can be set based on considerations of justice rather than supply and demand.\n\nPuzder has created jobs, with CKE and its franchisees employing approximately 90,000 people. He has expressed concerns about government regulations that increase his outlets' costs and reduce their profitability. Puzder's perspective, while different from that of a labor activist, may offer a unique viewpoint on labor issues.\n\nPuzder has shown a willingness to compromise on the minimum wage, stating that he is not against a minimum wage higher than the current federal level of $7.25 an hour or one indexed to inflation. Puzder could potentially mitigate some of Trump's more controversial positions, as he has expressed support for a path to legal status for illegal immigrants, albeit short of citizenship.\n\nRex Tillerson, selected for the position of secretary of state, is not a stereotypical Texas oilman. As president of the Boy Scouts of America, he advocated for allowing gay troop leaders. Exxon Mobil, Tillerson's former company, has donated to Planned Parenthood. Tillerson's stance on issues such as carbon taxes and global warming has led some to view him as a potential ally for liberals on environmental matters.\n\nCritics argue that Tillerson may prioritize the interests of the oil industry over those of the American public. However, CEOs, including Tillerson, are often driven by the interests of shareholders and customers. Tillerson's background in the oil industry may subject him to increased scrutiny, but it also invites a higher standard of accountability for decisions affecting his former industry.\n\nTillerson's appointment was suggested by Robert Gates, who served as defense secretary under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Gates' endorsement of Hillary Clinton notwithstanding, his recommendation carries bipartisan weight, despite his consulting firm's work for Exxon Mobil.\n\nTillerson lacks diplomatic experience, but he has worked with various regimes, as have other secretaries of state such as John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, and Condoleezza Rice. Tillerson is described as a \"hard-eyed realist\" by Gates, and his alleged affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin has been a point of contention. However, former Vice President Dick Cheney, known for his hardline stance on foreign policy, has endorsed Tillerson.\n\nBusiness executives, including Puzder and Tillerson, can bring valuable assets to government, offering relevant experience and seasoned judgment, which may be in short supply in the Trump administration. After weeks of controversial Cabinet nominations, such as Rudy Giuliani, Sarah Palin, and Newt Gingrich, Puzder and Tillerson are a relief for some, and Senate Democrats are urged to swiftly approve them before Trump might reconsider his choices.",

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) stated, \"For the 17th time, we asked to bring up the Born Alive Protection Act. For the 17th time, the Democrats refused.\"\n\nRep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) explained, \"There are babies being born alive and then ultimately murdered.\"\n\nChris Smith (R-NJ), the House pro-life caucus leader, described a case in a Florida abortion clinic where a baby, who was gasping for air, was put in a biohazard bag and thrown in the trash.\n\nDemocrats, who currently control the House, have prevented the act from coming to the floor for debate and a vote.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) expressed her disapproval, stating, \"This is the height of shamefulness. It is absolutely an abomination that this is going on and we're having to have this argument in the United States today.\"\n\nIn some states, lawmakers are pushing for radical abortion legislation to keep such practices legal. States like New York, Rhode Island, and Illinois are introducing bills that could potentially make their states abortion havens.\n\nJill Stanek, national campaign chair of the Susan B. Anthony List, explained, \"They've introduced the Reproductive Health Act, which (3107), according to one abortion group, could cement Illinois as the Midwest abortion oasis.\"\n\nMelissa Cifuentes, a pro-life activist, is fighting a similar law in Rhode Island. She stated, \"We are called to use our voice to speak the truth on behalf of innocent lives that are sacred and that are worthy of our protection.\"\n\nPro-life activists are urging Americans to contact their representatives in Congress to sign the discharge petition for the Born Alive Protection Act. If the petition gathers 218 signatures, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is required to let the bill come to the floor for a vote.",
    " Title: Trump's Remarks on Paris and London Attacks Spark Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the National Rifle Association (NRA) convention, U.S. President Donald Trump criticized gun control measures and highlighted the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris and an increase in knife violence in London. The comments sparked a response from French and British officials.\n\nFrance, in particular, was incensed by Trump's remarks, with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian issuing a statement on Saturday, expressing \"firm disapproval\" and calling for respect for the victims. Former French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande also tweeted his disapproval, stating that Trump's remarks \"say a lot about what he thinks of France and its values.\"\n\nTrump suggested that if Parisians in the cafes under attack had been armed, the outcome might have been different. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace responded by stating that \"the free flow of arms within society does not constitute a shield against terrorist attacks.\"\n\nIn the case of London, Trump compared an unnamed hospital to a \"war zone\" due to knife attacks, despite tough gun laws in the United Kingdom. British officialdom did not push back, with London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office declining to comment to CNN following Trump's remarks.\n\nFormer UK Cabinet minister Charlie Falconer tweeted his disapproval, stating that the U.S. murder rate is over five times higher than the UK's and that making it easier to obtain guns would not reduce the murder rate.\n\nAmid the furor, Dr. Martin Griffiths, a trauma surgeon at the Royal London Hospital, invited Trump to visit his hospital to discuss violence reduction in London. Professor Karim Brohi, a trauma surgeon at The Royal London Hospital and director of London's Major Trauma System, also hit back at Trump's speech, stating that the hospital has cut the number of young patients returning after further knife attacks from 45% to 1%.\n\nTrump and British Prime Minister Theresa May spoke by phone on Saturday, discussing China trade, North Korea, Iran, and Trump's upcoming visit to Britain. It's unknown whether they discussed Trump's remarks to the NRA.\n\nA previous version of this story misstated the source of France's comments and the time period when Charlie Falconer was a UK Cabinet minister. The comments came from the French foreign ministry, and Falconer served as Lord Chancellor from 2003 until 2007, and Secretary of State for Justice in 2007.",
    " Title: Grassroots Conservatives Express Disappointment Over GOP's Omnibus Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nGrassroots conservatives have expressed their dissatisfaction with the recent omnibus bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress, accusing the GOP establishment of breaking promises made during their election campaigns. The bill, which funds various government programs and agencies, has been criticized for including provisions that contradict conservative values, such as funding for Planned Parenthood, visas for un-vetted migrants, and H-2B visas for foreign workers.\n\nThe criticism stems from the belief that the GOP establishment, in collusion with lobbyists and corrupt politicians, has failed to deliver on their promises to halt the \"fundamental transformation of America\" as promised during the 2010 and 2014 elections. The omnibus bill, which was written by lobbyists and passed by politicians, has been described as a betrayal of conservative values and a step towards further government spending and debt.\n\nGrassroots conservatives have long rallied to action under the belief that change starts at the ballot box. Many have sacrificed personal time and resources to support Republican candidates, hoping for a conservative majority in Congress and a change in the federal government's direction. However, the passage of the omnibus bill has led to a sense of disillusionment and betrayal among grassroots conservatives, who feel that the GOP establishment has failed to deliver on their promises.\n\nThe criticism extends to the GOP establishment's perceived lack of concern for winning national elections. Some argue that the establishment would rather maintain their positions in Congress, even if it means a Democrat in the White House, as it allows them to avoid taking leadership roles and continue to enjoy the perks of office.\n\nDespite the criticism, there are still some within the GOP who are dissatisfied with the status quo and are working to bring about change. The Tea Party movement, for example, has brought more conservative-leaning members to Congress, offering a glimmer of hope for grassroots conservatives.\n\nIn conclusion, grassroots conservatives have expressed their disappointment with the GOP establishment over the omnibus bill, accusing them of breaking promises made during the 2010 and 2014 elections. The criticism extends to the GOP establishment's perceived lack of concern for winning national elections and their failure to deliver on conservative values. However, there are still some within the GOP who are working to bring about change, offering a glimmer of hope for grassroots conservatives.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Grows at 2.6% in Q4, Suggesting Sustained Growth Amid Fed's Patient Approach to Interest Rates\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy expanded at a 2.6% annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to a report by the Commerce Department on Thursday. This growth rate is slightly below the 2.2% median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg but follows a 3.4% advance in the previous three months.\n\nThe growth was driven by an increase in business investment, which grew 6.2% on equipment, software, and research spending. Consumption, which accounts for the majority of the economy, grew 2.8%, slightly below forecasts. Government spending slowed, trade was a minor drag, and inventories gave GDP a small boost.\n\nThe report suggests that the Republican-backed tax cuts may have continued to aid growth, helping bring the full-year figure to 3.1%, just above President Donald Trump's 3% goal. The expansion is poised to become the nation's longest on record at midyear, amid a still-healthy consumer, supportive Fed, and robust labor market.\n\nHowever, the pace could cool amid the trade war, slowing global growth, and fading impact of fiscal stimulus. A separate report Thursday from the Labor Department showed filings for unemployment benefits rose by more than expected last week to 225,000, still near a five-decade low.\n\nGrowth, while slower than the prior two quarters, remains above both the average pace of the expansion and what the Fed sees as the economy's long-run potential of 1.9%. Still, surveys and gauges such as Treasury yields indicate chances of a recession have increased in recent months while remaining unlikely for 2019.\n\nThe increase in consumer spending followed the third quarter's 3.5% gain. It contributed 1.92 percentage points to growth. Drivers included health care, financial services and insurance, and other nondurable goods and services, while spending on food services and accommodations fell.\n\nThe GDP data may reinforce analyst criticism of the government's recent report on December retail sales. That showed the biggest drop in nine years, even as other figures -- particularly reports from the country\u2019s largest retailers -- indicated consumers continued to open their wallets in the quarter.\n\nThursday's report showed the third-quarter slowdown in business spending may have been temporary. Nonresidential fixed investment contributed 0.82 percentage point to growth following 0.35 point in the third quarter. Within that category, spending on structures fell 4.2%, the biggest drop in a year, a slowdown that may partly reflect falling oil prices. Business-equipment investment rose 6.7% and intellectual property spending jumped 13.1%.\n\nHousing remained a weak spot last quarter, posting the fourth consecutive drag on GDP growth, with a contraction of 3.5%. Home sales tumbled in late 2018 amid elevated mortgage rates and price increases that continued to outpace wages, though there are signs of demand picking up in early 2019 thanks to a drop in borrowing costs.\n\nNet exports subtracted 0.22 percentage point from GDP growth during the quarter following a 1.99-point reduction in the prior period. The drag reflected a 2.7% rise in imports that outpaced a 1.6% increase in exports, with the tariff war buffeting both sets of flows.\n\nInventories added 0.13 percentage point to the pace of expansion. Meanwhile, inflation remained muted, adding little urgency for the Fed to consider resuming interest-rate hikes. The GDP report showed the Fed's preferred price index rose at a 1.5% annualized pace last quarter, below the central bank's 2% goal. Excluding food and energy, the index rose 1.7%.",
    " Title: Trump Signs $1.3 Trillion Spending Bill, Averts Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump signed the recently passed $1.3 trillion spending bill on Friday, ending a brief period of uncertainty sparked by a tweeted veto threat that hinted at a potential government shutdown.\n\nTrump stated that he had signed the bill, despite his reservations on certain issues, due to a $60 billion increase in military spending, which he considered a worthwhile compromise. He expressed his displeasure with the bill, stating, \"I am not going to do it again.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, White House and Capitol Hill aides were left in a state of confusion following Trump's criticism of the six-month spending bill, despite prior assurances from the administration that he would sign it before the midnight deadline. Trump's initial tweet read, \"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\"\n\nTrump subsequently held discussions with his senior advisers regarding a potential veto, but was advised against it. Advisers warned him that he would be blamed for a shutdown and that negotiations on the issues he is concerned about were still ongoing, according to one aide.\n\nBy early afternoon, Trump appeared before reporters in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House to announce he had signed the measure. He acknowledged his dissatisfaction with the bill, stating, \"There are a lot of things I'm unhappy about in this bill.\"\n\nThe bill includes $1.6 billion for six months' worth of work on the U.S.-Mexico border wall project, but Trump had sought $25 billion for it. Trump has also been at odds with Democrats in Congress over the fate of Dreamer immigrants - those brought to the United States illegally when they were children.\n\nTrump canceled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which grants work permits to Dreamers and protects them from deportation. The decision is currently tied up in court cases. He offered to extend the protections, tied to a sweeping set of changes to immigration laws, but subsequently rejected bipartisan offers from lawmakers.\n\nAs the six-month spending budget deal was being finalized, there had been reports that Trump had balked at the bill and had to be persuaded by Speaker Paul Ryan to support it. The conservative wing of Trump's party had criticized the bill due to its spending increases, while some deficit hawks cheered Trump's Friday morning threat to veto it.\n\nIt remains unclear how seriously Republican leaders took Trump's shutdown threat, as neither Speaker Paul Ryan nor Senate Leader Mitch McConnell commented publicly on it. Lawmakers in the Republican-dominated Senate and House of Representatives had already left Washington for a scheduled two-week spring recess, and Trump himself was scheduled to fly to Florida for a weekend at his private resort.",
    " Title: Sen. Cory Booker Proposes Federal Savings Account for Every U.S. Child to Address Economic Inequality\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a potential 2020 presidential candidate, has introduced a bill to establish interest-bearing savings accounts for every child born in the United States. The aim is to address rising economic inequality.\n\nThe bill, as outlined in a summary released Monday, would create interest-bearing accounts administered by the Treasury Department, with a $1,000 principal balance granted by the federal government at birth. The government would deposit up to $2,000 annually into each child's account, depending on total family income, until the recipient turns 18.\n\nThe accounts would be federally insured, and the funds could only be used for homeownership and \"human and financial capital investments that [change] life trajectories,\" according to the summary.\n\n\"Everyone in America should have a real shot to succeed, but federal policy over decades and an upside-down tax code that heaps benefits on the very rich and big corporations have grown the gap between those who have much and those who have little,\" Booker said in a statement. \"Today, nearly one in three American families have zero to negative wealth, and it's hard to get ahead if you begin life behind the starting line.\"\n\nThe program, if implemented in 2019, would cost approximately $60 billion and would be funded by increasing the capital gains tax rate by 4.2 points, increasing the estate tax to its 2009 level, and raising taxes on multimillion-dollar inheritances.\n\nEconomic inequality, typically measured by the wealth gap between the richest and poorest Americans, has steadily risen since the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The resulting spike in equity and property values has left much of the working class behind. There is also a significant racial wealth gap due to decades of discriminatory laws and business practices that have prevented minorities from accessing the same financial products and investments as whites. The median net worth of whites is roughly 10 times larger than that of blacks, and nearly 1 in 5 black families have zero or negative net worth, according to Federal Reserve data from 2017.\n\nBooker's bill is the latest sweeping policy proposal from a 2020 hopeful aimed at bolstering the economic stability of working- and middle-class Americans. Several of Booker's potential Democratic primary rivals, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.), have also introduced bills to bolster the supply of affordable housing and increase low-income household wealth. A similar federally funded savings program was instituted in Israel last year.",
    " Title: Turkey Launches Military Offensive Against Kurdish Fighters in Northern Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nTurkey launched a military offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria on Wednesday, following President Trump's announcement of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region. Airstrikes and artillery bombarded the area, softening defenses for a ground offensive as tensions escalated into a dramatic first day of what Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called \"Operation Peace Spring.\"\n\nErdogan described the operation as a push against terrorists, aiming to \"destroy the terror corridor which is trying to be established on our southern border and to bring peace... to the region.\" He also stated that Turkey's objective is to \"preserve Syria's territorial integrity and liberate local communities from terrorists.\"\n\nAlthough the U.S. administration agreed to remove U.S. troops, which had been working alongside local Kurds to fight ISIS, Trump stated in a Wednesday statement that the White House \"made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea.\" Trump also emphasized that Turkey \"has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place.\"\n\nTrump defended his decision to withdraw troops, stating, \"The United States has spent EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS fighting and policing in the Middle East. Now we are slowly & carefully bringing our great soldiers & military home. Our focus is on the BIG PICTURE!\"\n\nTurkey views the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in Syria as terrorists due to their ties to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey. Heavy shelling targeted border towns, causing civilians to flee for safer ground. Turkish jets reportedly pulverized suspected hiding spots of Syrian Kurdish forces in the town of Ras al-Ayn, creating booming explosions that could be heard across the border in Turkey.\n\nA US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, stated that the airstrikes were not coordinated with the U.S. military. Additionally, bombs hit an office of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Tal Abyad, sending nearby residents running for their lives.\n\nAt least seven civilians and one member of Kurdish-led forces were killed in the first day of fighting, according to Kurdish activists and a Syrian war monitor.\n\nTurkey had been poised to advance into Syria since U.S. forces began vacating the area following Trump's abrupt policy shift, which has been criticized in Washington, including by Republicans, as a betrayal of the U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters who helped combat ISIS.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, typically a reliable Trump supporter, lamented, \"Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration.\"\n\nDespite the reservations of Graham and others on both sides of the aisle, Trump insisted in his comments Wednesday that he wants to end \"forever wars\" claiming American lives. He also stated that the Kurds, while traditional allies of the Americans, haven't always been there.\n\n\"They didn't help us in the Second World War, they didn't help us with Normandy,\" said Trump, adding that they only fight for \"their land.\"\n\n\"With all of that being said, we like the Kurds,\" he added.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council is set to meet behind closed doors on Thursday to discuss the conflict. The sit-down was requested by the five European members of the 15-member council\u2014Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and Poland, diplomats said.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Overturns Obama-Era Rules on Handling University Sex Assault Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has overturned rules introduced during the Obama administration for handling university sex assault allegations. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stated that the previous administration's guidance was unfairly tilted against the accused.\n\nMrs. DeVos emphasized that campuses would continue to confront such \"horrific crimes,\" but she added that the process must be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes. The new interim instructions allow universities to decide the standard of evidence to be used when handling complaints.\n\nThe DeVos guidelines introduce the higher standard of proof, requiring \"clear and convincing evidence\" in campus sex assault cases. Under President Obama, universities were able to judge students based on a preponderance of evidence, instead of guilt being proved beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases.\n\nThe Obama administration's 2011 and 2014 college sexual misconduct policies also required colleges to investigate complaints even if there was a separate criminal inquiry. Critics of that approach said it protected survivors at the expense of the accused's rights.\n\nThe Obama administration took action after dozens of women said their sex assault cases had been mishandled. In one high-profile 2016 case at Stanford University in California, an athlete's six-month sentence, after he was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious student, was condemned as outrageously lenient.\n\nHowever, Mrs. DeVos stated earlier this month, \"Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today.\"\n\nAdvocates for sexual assault victims warned that Friday's policy reversal would deter victims from stepping forward. Kim Churches, chief executive officer of the American Association of University Women, said, \"This is a blatant rollback from the strong and much-needed guidance that was in place.\"\n\nHouse of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi denounced the change as a \"shocking attack\" on women. In July, Mrs. DeVos's top civil rights deputy, Candice Jackson, provoked fury when she told a reporter that 90% of campus rape investigations \"fall into the category of 'we were both drunk.'\"\n\nShe said the majority of such cases amounted to \" 'we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.'\" Ms. Jackson apologized, and a Democratic senator, Patty Murray of Washington state, called in vain for her to be fired.\n\nEarlier this month, the Education Department said 360 sexual violence cases were under investigation at 250 colleges and universities across the US.",
    " Title: Banning Flavored Vaping Products: A Case of Hasty Policies and Unclear Causes\n\nArticle:\n\nThe sale of flavored vaping products has been banned in several states, including Michigan and New York, due to a recent outbreak of lung-related illnesses. However, the cause of these illnesses remains unclear, and there is no evidence that the flavoring in these products is responsible.\n\nAccording to National Public Radio, the role of flavored vape products in the current outbreak is unknown. Some lawmakers and public health advocates have been pushing for flavored vape products to be banned since flavors first entered the market, out of a concern that they appeal to children. The timing of the recent move to ban flavored vape products may be linked to the current public concern about overall e-cigarette safety.\n\nHowever, this is a case of those who oppose vaping in general using the latest crisis as a means to create a banning frenzy. The Washington Post has reported that the vast majority of the sick vape users have reported using a marijuana oil called THC in their vape pens, and many people have started using illegal vape cartridges containing THC, which also contain significant amounts of vitamin E acetate. The medical news website MedPage Today quoted a New York health official who said, \"These were long-time vapers who had recently switched to cheaper THC- or CBD- products purchased from unlicensed retailers.\"\n\nThe matter also needs to be kept in perspective. Smoking combustible cigarettes is a dangerous habit, one likely to shave 10 years off of a smoker's life\u2014and lead to costly and debilitating health problems. Vaping is one of the most effective ways to help adult smokers break their deadly habit. In 2016, the Royal College of Physicians in Great Britain reported that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than smoking. More than half a million people die annually from tobacco-related diseases, so vaping's potential health benefits should not be ignored.\n\nVaping clearly is not without its health risks, and measures need to be taken to keep them out of the hands of underage people. However, e-cigarettes need to be available to help adult smokers quit a more-dangerous habit. If cigarette smokers can no longer buy vaping liquids, they may keep smoking cigarettes, which will still be available at their local convenience store.\n\nYoung people have been smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, toking marijuana, and vaping in contravention of the law since those substances have been available. The right approach is to enforce current laws and educate children about their dangers. That may not be satisfying amid calls for policymakers to \"do something,\" but it's sensible. That is, unless you seriously think that banning adult sales of wine, beer, and spirits is the best way to combat underage drinking.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling on Trademark Case Affects Native American Groups and Brands' Response to Racial Stereotypes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn 2017, the Supreme Court made a landmark decision in the case Matal v. Tam, which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the law to ban trademarks deemed \"disparaging.\" The Asian rock band, The Slants, celebrated the victory, with lead singer Simon Tam stating, \"It can\u2019t be a win for free speech if some people benefit and others don\u2019t.\" However, the outcome of Matal v. Tam had far-reaching implications, particularly for the decades-long legal challenge to the Washington Redskins trademark.\n\nThe same day as the court's ruling on the Tam case, Dan Snyder, the owner of the Washington football team, issued a statement, \"I am THRILLED! Hail to the Redskins.\" Suzan Shown Harjo, a Cheyenne and Muscogee Creek activist and scholar, and later a team of Native American plaintiffs led by Amanda Blackhorse, had been leading the challenge to the Redskins trademark. Harjo defiantly insisted, \"It may have killed our case, but it hasn\u2019t killed our movement.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, several brands are reevaluating the harmful stereotypes they once perpetuated. Recently, Quaker Oats, the owner of the 131-year-old Aunt Jemima brand, announced changes to the product name in pursuit of \"progress toward racial equality.\" The brand had long capitalized on a romanticized view of antebellum American slavery, even hiring a former slave to impersonate the character of Aunt Jemima at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair.\n\nFollowing Quaker's announcement, the Mars corporation announced similar changes to its Uncle Ben's rice products. Even Mrs. Butterworth's pancake syrup, with a bottle embodying a racist caricature of a black woman, is undergoing a \"complete brand and package review.\"",

    " Title: Interactive Tool Simulates Carbon Emissions Reduction in Response to COVID-19 and Climate Change\n\nArticle:\n\nA new interactive tool, \"ACES: A Post Covid Emissions Simulator,\" developed by artificial intelligence start-up HyperGiant, provides a perspective on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on carbon emissions and its relationship to climate change. The tool allows users to adjust pandemic-induced behaviors and calculate the potential carbon dioxide reduction if these changes were made permanent.\n\nFor instance, if 30% of the workforce works from home, air travel is reduced by 50%, and people eat 15% less meat, the tool estimates that 18 billion tons of carbon dioxide would be eliminated, which is 38% of the way towards the emissions reduction targets set by the Paris climate accord. The United States signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 and pledged to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by about a quarter by 2030 from 2005 levels. In 2019, the U.S. officially withdrew from the agreement.\n\nThe tool also allows users to activate new technologies, such as carbon capture, renewable power generation, and revolutionary land management and agriculture strategies, to determine what it would take to reach carbon neutrality (where the net total carbon emissions equal zero, either through reducing carbon emissions to zero or supporting enough carbon offset programs that offset carbon emissions).\n\nFor example, if 30% of the workforce works from home, air travel is reduced by 50%, people eat 15% less meat, and all vehicles in the U.S. are electric, the tool estimates that 33 billion tons of carbon dioxide would be eliminated by 2050. While this satisfies the Paris Agreement, it is not enough to \"reach carbon neutrality and avoid the worst effects of climate change,\" according to the simulator.\n\n\"One of the most difficult things about understanding climate change is understanding the size of the actual climate problem relative to the size of the potential solutions,\" HyperGiant climate advisor Noam Bar-Zemer tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 Make It. \"If I tell you that we will not emit billions of tons of CO2 as a result of Covid-19, that sounds like a lot unless you know how to compare it to the size of the greenhouse gas crisis.\" The tool makes it easier for people to compare and understand the impact of proposed solutions, Bar-Zemer adds.\n\nHyperGiant, headquartered in Austin, Texas, was founded in 2018 and has over 230 employees. The company works with companies in various industries, including space and healthcare, to problem-solve and boost efficiency via artificial intelligence solutions.

The president stated, \"If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.\" The president's remarks were followed by a discussion on the historical context and the disproportionate representation of African-Americans in the criminal justice system.\n\nPresident Obama acknowledged the complexities of the issue, stating, \"We understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country, and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history.\"\n\nThe president's comments touched on the disproportionate involvement of African-American young men in the criminal justice system. He emphasized that this is not an attempt to make excuses but rather to understand the issue in a historical context.\n\nHowever, the president's statement also sparked questions about the role of individual choices and societal factors in shaping the circumstances of African-Americans. Issues such as broken families, high abortion rates, and the portrayal of African-Americans in media and entertainment were not addressed in the president's statement.\n\nA reader on The Washington Post's website, posting under the name \"Chaquita1,\" shared a personal story about witnessing a confrontation between an African-American woman and two young men on a train. The woman reportedly admonished the young men for their behavior, stating, \"Trayvon Martin died for nothing. His death did not empower you, it should have been a wake-up call.\"\n\nThe president has called for a national conversation about race, and discussions like the one described by \"Chaquita1\" may contribute to this dialogue, as they highlight the complexities and nuances of racial issues in the United States.",

The language he used is offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable.\" They also expressed regret for not catching the clips earlier and for the subpar vetting process.\n\nA podcast from September 2018 was circulated in which Gillis mocked Chinese people and described his remarks as \"nice racism.\" In another episode from the same month, Gillis used homophobic slurs to describe Hollywood producer Judd Apatow and comedian Chris Gethard.\n\nGillis defended the comments on Twitter, saying he is a comedian \"who pushes boundaries.\" He continued, \"My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\"\n\nGood Good Comedy Theatre in Philadelphia, Gillis' hometown, stated on Twitter that they had \"deliberately chosen not to work\" with him because of his \"overt racism, sexism, homophobia - expressed both on and off stage.\"\n\nComedian Rob Schneider, a former SNL cast member, tweeted his support for Gillis, saying he had fallen foul of \"culture unforgiveness.\" Fellow comics Bill Burr and Jim Jeffries also criticized SNL's decision while appearing on the US series Lights Out with David Spade.\n\nJeffries said the move was a symptom of \"cancel culture.\" He said, \"The guy should not have been fired. It's just a couple of things back in his history - are we going to go through everyone's history? Or are we going to get rid of every sketch that SNL has done that involves race?\"\n\nBurr added, \"Did they go back and also try and look back at good things the person might have done, or are they just looking for the bad stuff?\"\n\nTaiwanese-American presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who Gillis referred to using a slur in a podcast, has said the comedian \"deserved another chance to keep his job\" but society has become \"unduly punitive and vindictive.\"\n\nYang said Gillis has reached out to him, and the two will be having a discussion soon. In addition to Gillis, SNL had announced the hiring of two other new cast members: Chloe Fineman and Bowen Yang. Yang will be the show's first full-time Chinese-American cast member.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Block Bills Aimed at 20-Week Abortion Ban and Health Care Provider Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats blocked two bills on Tuesday that aimed to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and impose penalties on healthcare providers who do not provide medical aid to babies born alive after failed abortions. The bills were introduced by Senate Republicans as a means to appeal to their conservative base in an election year and to highlight the Democrats' stance on expanded abortion rights.\n\nOne of the measures, sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), would have imposed criminal penalties, including a fine or a possible five-year prison term, for medical providers who perform abortions after a fetus reaches five months gestation. The bill included exceptions for pregnancy complications that threaten the pregnant person's life or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.\n\nThe Senate voted 53-44 to move forward with the 20-week ban, but it fell short of the 60 votes needed. Senators Joe Manchin III (D-WV) and Bob Casey (D-PA) voted with Republicans, while Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), two moderate Republicans, voted with Democrats to block the bill.\n\nThe bill targeting healthcare providers was blocked 56-41. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) introduced the measure, which required healthcare workers to give medical care to a baby born alive after a botched abortion, ensuring the child is admitted to a hospital. If they failed to act, they would have faced a fine or prison time.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said the two bills provided senators a chance to take a \"clear moral stand,\" suggesting the GOP leader wanted to put Democrats on record for abortion restrictions he called \"morally straightforward.\" Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) said the votes revealed Democrats stand for infanticide.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) said the measures were aimed at energizing the Republicans' far-right base. \"Priorities in the Senate are way out of line,\" the New York Democrat said, adding the chamber should be working on legislation dealing with election security, background checks for firearms, and dealing with the coronavirus.\n\nCritics of the bills said they are unnecessary and aimed at further limiting a woman's control over her body. They argued that state laws already ban murder, pushing back on the need for Sen. Sasse's bill. Proponents of the measures argued that the bills are humane and based on science.\n\nThe votes put the senators on record about late-term abortions. Only seven countries permit abortions beyond 20 weeks. Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT), the founder and chairman of the Pro-Life Caucus, said the votes against the measures were \"astonishing,\" and he promised to continue pushing pro-life policies. \"This shouldn't be about politics. It's about protecting life,\" he said.\n\nThe Democratic Party has moved toward expanding abortion rights, including for the first time in 2016 making overturning the ban on federally funding for abortions part of the party platform. The issues surrounding late-term abortion, however, remain dicey for the party. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a top 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, recently got into hot water when he dodged an Iowa voter's question about late-term abortions. He said it should be the pregnant person's decision, not the government's. The remark spurred complaints that he was alienating pro-life Democrats.",
    " Title: Bannon Faces Criticism Following Moore's Loss in Alabama Senate Race\n\nArticle:\n\nSteve Bannon, the CEO of Breitbart News and former White House chief strategist, has faced criticism following the loss of Republican candidate Roy Moore to Democrat Doug Jones in the Alabama Senate race. Bannon was one of Moore's earliest and most vocal supporters, campaigning for him both before and after the allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced.\n\nMatt Drudge, a prominent conservative media figure, commented on the election results, stating, \"Luther Strange would have won in a landslide... Just too much crazy in nerve-racking times. There is a limit!\" Strange was President Trump's preferred candidate in the primary race, leading many to point their finger at Bannon for the whole debacle.\n\nSteve Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, issued a statement saying, \"This is a brutal reminder that candidate quality matters regardless of where you are running. Not only did Steve Bannon cost us a critical Senate seat in one of the most Republican states in the country, but he also dragged the President of the United States into his fiasco.\"\n\nBen Shapiro, editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire and a former Breitbart editor, also weighed in, writing, \"Bannon's sure showing those establishment cucks a thing or two right now.\" Dana Loesch, a talk radio host, author, and NRA spokeswoman, commented on Twitter, \"Can we stop now with the 'Bannon is a masterful strategist' nonsense? I've never seen such descriptions used more and deserved less.\"\n\nJosh Holmes, former chief of staff and campaign manager to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, tweeted, \"Before we get the results, I'd just like to thank Steve Bannon for showing us how to lose the reddest state in the union and Governor Ivey for the opportunity to make this national embarrassment a reality.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Megan McCain, co-host of \"The View\" and daughter of Sen. John McCain, simply had this to say: \"Suck it Bannon.\" The criticism comes as Bannon continues to promote his political agenda and influence within the Republican Party.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Indicts Twelve Russian Intelligence Officers for 2016 U.S. Presidential Election Interference\n\nArticle:\n\nA Grand Jury in the District of Columbia has charged twelve Russian intelligence officers with conspiring to hack into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, steal documents, and stage releases of the stolen documents to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. The operation, according to the indictment, targeted over 300 individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign, DCCC, and DNC.\n\nThe indictment alleges that the operation was sustained and sophisticated, and it was consequential. While the scale of the attack on the Clinton campaign, the DCCC, and the DNC was troubling, the available public evidence at this point suggests that the Russians also attempted to hack Republicans, but the indictment outlines a comprehensive and sustained effort against the Democrats and is silent about a similar conspiracy aimed at Republicans.\n\nThe indictment provides a clearer picture of the precise details of alleged Russian election meddling than any other source. It demonstrates why it's important that Special Counsel Robert Mueller be permitted to finish his work, as our nation needs to know what happened in 2016.\n\nThe indictment also indicates that Mueller possesses evidence and information that the public hasn't yet seen. For example, paragraph 43a of the indictment contains the first evidence of possible Russian collusion with an American candidate for public office, not President Trump, but an unnamed candidate for Congress. The indictment also includes a disturbing detail about a transfer of information, including the personal identifying information of Democratic donors, to a \"state lobbyist and online source of political news.\"\n\nFurthermore, there's a partial record of communication between the newly indicted Russians and a \"person who was in regular contact with senior members\" of Trump's presidential campaign. While the indictment doesn't establish collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, it clearly indicates that Mueller possesses evidence and information that the public hasn't yet seen.\n\nThe indictment makes it even more troubling that President Trump mocks, denigrates, and undermines the Mueller investigation as a \"witch hunt.\" We now know that there was real wrongdoing; we just don't yet know its extent. We don't yet know if Trump cooperated in any way with Russian schemes. However, when we learn more about the extent of Russian efforts to disrupt the 2016 election (and aid Trump), when we remember that Donald Jr. actually tried to collude, when we ponder for more than a few moments the web of financial connections between senior Trump aides such as Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn and the Kremlin or Kremlin allies, and when we know that Russians contacted Trump friends and advisers to offer \"dirt\" on the Clinton campaign\u2014well, Trump's repeated demands that the investigation end become much less understandable.\n\nRepublicans were rightly outraged when Barack Obama opined about the pending Clinton-email investigation, and we have since learned that his gratuitous and public exoneration of the then\u2013likely Democratic nominee created a headache for the FBI. Now it's time for Republicans to be consistent. As Mueller reveals more facts about Russian interference and indicts more individuals for troubling crimes uncovered as part of his entirely legitimate investigation, it's time for the GOP to tell the president that the hunt needs to continue, because the witches are very real.",
    " Title: Pelosi Calls for Removal of Confederate Statues from U.S. Capitol\n\nArticle:\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has called for the removal of nearly a dozen Confederate statues from the U.S. Capitol building, following the death of George Floyd and nationwide protests against racial injustice. In a letter to Joint Committee on the Library Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Vice Chair Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Pelosi stated that the statues in the Capitol should embody the nation's highest ideals, not its divisive past.\n\nPelosi pointed out that two of the statues currently in National Statuary Hall, a landmark in the Capitol housing various historical members, are the statues of the president and vice president of the Confederate States, Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens \u2013 both of whom were charged with treason against the United States.\n\nStephens is known for his infamous speech on the Confederacy, in which he stated, \"Our new government is founded upon \u2026 the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.\" Pelosi wrote, \"Monuments to men who advocated cruelty and barbarism to achieve such a plainly racist end are a grotesque affront to these ideals. Their statues pay homage to hate, not heritage. They must be removed.\"\n\nVice Chair Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) told Fox News, \"I agree that the Joint Committee and Architect of the Capitol should expediently remove these symbols of cruelty and bigotry from the halls of the Capitol. I stand ready, and call on the Chair of the Joint Committee to swiftly approve the removal of these statues.\"\n\nPelosi attempted to have the Confederate statues removed in 2017, appealing to then-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Ryan argued that it should be up to the states that placed them in Statuary Hall to remove them. While states have the right to switch out their statue of choice from the Hall, Congress has the final say on what is and is not allowed to be kept in the Capitol.\n\nAccording to a 1864 law passed by Congress, Statuary Hall allows each state to place up to two statues in the Hall. The law was further amended in 2000, to allow states to replace sculptures placed in the Hall. However, Congressional Research Service reports state that the Architect of the Capitol, upon the approval of the Joint Committee on the Library, is authorized to locate or relocate collection statues within the Capitol.\n\nPelosi wrote, \"While I believe it is imperative that we never forget our history lest we repeat it, I also believe that there is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country.\"",
    " Title: New Research Suggests Microplastic Pollution in Oceans and Rivers May Be Underestimated\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study suggests that the abundance of microplastic pollution in the oceans may have been significantly underestimated. Researchers from the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the UK and other institutions found many more microplastic particles using nets with a fine mesh size compared to coarser ones typically used to filter microplastics.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Environmental Pollution, used nets with mesh sizes of 100 microns (0.1mm), 333 microns, and 500 microns. The team found 2.5 times more particles in the finest net than in the 333 micron net, which is the kind usually used to filter microplastics, and 10 times more than in the 500 micron net.\n\nThe surface trawls off the coast of Plymouth in the UK and the coast of Maine in the US showed similar results, suggesting they are representative of waters near populated land. The particles were dominated by fibers from textiles such as ropes, nets, and clothing.\n\nProf. Pennie Lindeque, who led the research, said, \"Using an extrapolation, we suggest microplastic concentrations could exceed 3,700 particles per cubic meter \u2013 that's far more than the number of zooplankton you would find.\" These tiny animals are among the most abundant species on the planet.\n\nAnother new study, published in the journal Global Change Biology, shows how microplastics have entered the food chain in rivers. The research analyzed the droppings and regurgitated pellets of white-throated dippers at 15 river sites in south Wales. The scientists found that the birds, which feed on river insects, were eating about 200 pieces of plastic a day. These were mostly fibers, and a quarter were larger than 500 microns.\n\nThe team also found that the dippers were feeding thousands of plastic fibers to their nest-bound chicks during their development. Previous research by the scientists had shown that half of the river insects contain microplastic fragments.\n\nThe impact on the health of the birds is not yet understood. \"It is imperative we understand whether microplastics add to the other pollution problems that affect dippers and other river organisms, and we use that knowledge to guide remedial action,\" said Prof. Steve Ormerod, who led the work.\n\nMicroplastic pollution has contaminated the whole planet, from Arctic snow and mountain soils to many rivers and the deepest oceans. It is also being consumed and inhaled by people, and the health impacts are as yet unknown.",
    " Title: Sen. Rand Paul Introduces Bill to End No-Knock Warrants, Citing Breonna Taylor's Death\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has introduced legislation to abolish no-knock warrants, a measure that has bipartisan support as lawmakers discuss broader police reforms. The bill, titled the Justice for Breonna Taylor Act, would prohibit federal law enforcement from executing a warrant until an officer provides notice of their authority and purpose.\n\nThe legislation also applies to state and local law enforcement agencies that receive funding from the Justice Department. In a statement, Sen. Paul stated, \"After talking with Breonna Taylor's family, I've come to the conclusion that it's long past time to get rid of no-knock warrants. This bill will effectively end no-knock raids in the United States.\"\n\nTaylor, a 26-year-old black woman, was fatally shot in her home in Kentucky by police executing a no-knock warrant. The bill comes as Congress debates how to respond to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who was killed while in police custody in Minneapolis.\n\nA proposal unveiled by House and Senate Democrats earlier this week would ban the use of no-knock warrants in federal drug cases and tie law enforcement funding to state and local agencies on a similar ban. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) is drafting a Senate GOP proposal, which he is expected to unveil next week.\n\nPaul's legislation also comes after he had disagreements with Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) over an amendment to the bill that would make lynching a federal hate crime. In a statement earlier this month, Sen. Paul stated that he was trying to add an amendment that would \"apply a serious bodily injury standard, which would ensure crimes resulting in substantial risk of death and extreme physical pain be prosecuted as a lynching.\"\n\nHowever, Sens. Booker and Harris accused him of trying to water down the bill. The details of the amendment and the response from the senators are not specified in the provided text.",
    " Title: Progressive Movement Divided: Sanders Endorses Biden, but Not All Follow Suit\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has endorsed Joe Biden for the Democrat nomination, but not all members of his political movement are following suit. On Monday, shortly after Sanders' endorsement, his one-time campaign spokeswoman, Briahna Joy Gray, announced that she was not endorsing Biden.\n\nGray, who has been vocal about her disagreement with other high-profile national Democrats, cited Biden's unwillingness to adopt progressive stances on the economy and healthcare as the reason for her decision. \"With the utmost respect for Bernie Sanders, who is an incredible human being [and] a genuine inspiration, I don't endorse Joe Biden,\" she wrote on social media.\n\nGray supported Sanders because he backed ideas like Medicare for All, cancelling all student debt, and a wealth tax. However, she noted, Biden supports none of those.\n\nThe ideological differences highlighted by Gray underscore the challenge that lies ahead for Biden. Since the former vice president routed his opposition on Super Tuesday to become the presumptive nominee, progressives aligned with Sanders have been exploring their options for the general election. Many seem to have found Biden, who has unequivocally come out against universal healthcare and has shown disdain for the \"socialist\" label, wanting.\n\nIn recent weeks, as it became apparent that the former vice president would be the nominee, a small but vocal \"Never Biden\" community has sprouted up on social media. Its members include former campaign operatives, sympathetic media pundits, and the types of average voters that made Sanders' 2016 insurgent campaign possible.\n\nBiden has offered several olive branches to the disaffected Sanders supporters. Last month, the former vice president opted to adopt the bankruptcy proposal authored by his former rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). The decision was a full repudiation of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which Biden authored and progressives have long claimed was a giveaway to big banks. Biden's shift on bankruptcy was followed up last week by an embrace of lowering the age of Medicaid eligibility to 60 and student loan forgiveness for individuals making below $125,000-per-year.\n\nHowever, these efforts have not been successful. More than a few members of Sanders' political movement have rejected the olive branches as not going far enough. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who endorsed the Vermont senator last year and campaigned for him ahead of the Iowa Caucuses, described Biden's proposal as \"almost an insult.\"\n\n\"I think Hillary [Clinton] was looking at policies that lowered it to 50,\" the congresswoman told The New York Times in an interview published Monday. \"So we're talking about a 'progressive concession' that is ten years worse than what the nominee had in 2016.\"\n\nPolicy differences are not the only reason why many members of Sanders' political movement remain uncommitted about backing Biden. Some, in particular, are concerned about new sexual assault allegations leveled against the former vice president by former staffer Tara Reade.\n\nIn fact, when Reade's allegations first surfaced last month, a top Sanders supporter announced they believed the accusations were true. Others from the Never Biden community soon echoed the sentiment, with some even openly saying the allegations were disqualifying for the former vice president's candidacy.\n\nThis poses a major predicament. In 2016, President Donald Trump won the White House, in part, because disaffected Sanders supporters opted to stay home or vote third party. Decreased turnout for the Democrat ticket that year, coupled with Trump's populist appeals to white working-class voters in the Midwest, led to a GOP victory.\n\nA similar scenario could repeat itself this year. Exit polls from last month's Michigan primary found that only two out of five Sanders supporters would be willing to back Biden in November, according to Politico. If those numbers hold on election day, it would spell disaster for Biden, especially as Michigan is considered a must-win if Democrats have any hope of retaking the White House.\n\nSanders, himself, appears to understand the predicament members of his one-time movement pose for Biden. On Monday, while endorsing the former vice president, the Vermont senator urged his supporters to fall in line behind the Democrat nominee.\n\n\"We must come together to defeat the most dangerous president in modern history,\" Sanders said.",
    " Title: Sanders' Influence and Work in Congress: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat and close ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, described Senator Bernie Sanders as working independently during his time in the House, with little recall of his collaborations or projects. His influence appears to be more pronounced in the Senate, according to Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio and progressive.\n\nSenator Brown noted that while some senators, such as Hubert Humphrey and Teddy Kennedy, were effective in both internal and external strategies, Sanders has chosen to focus on external strategy, building support from outside the Senate. His work as the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee has been mixed, with difficulties in recruiting and retaining top-tier staff for the committee.\n\nSenator Sanders has reportedly sought the assistance of Senator Patty Murray, a highly regarded legislative technician, to help navigate complex budget matters. Sanders is said to have a disdain for mundane, technocratic tasks, as evidenced by a former aide's recollection of him asking, \"What's the news for today?\" during a discussion of routine committee business.\n\nSenator Sanders' primary objective has been to shift the Democratic Party to the left, rather than negotiate compromises within the system. He has made an impact on select issues, such as challenging both parties' leadership on President Trump's support for Saudi intervention in Yemen, and pushing for improved pay and benefits for large employers like Amazon, Disney, and Walmart.\n\nHowever, Sanders acknowledged that the legislation aimed at large employers is unlikely to reach the floor. He views the legislation as a means to demonstrate support for workers and assert that significant success can be achieved without passing specific legislation.\n\nDespite his often-perceived curmudgeonly demeanor, Senator Sanders has made efforts to maintain a positive working relationship with Senator Elizabeth Warren. Recently, he was seen reconciling a disagreement between the two campaigns in a Senate hallway.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush's Presidential Campaign Faces Fundraising Challenges as Donor Support Wanes\n\nArticle:\n\nJeb Bush's presidential campaign, which has raised significantly more than his Republican rivals to date, is experiencing difficulties in maintaining its initial momentum. The former Florida governor is slipping in the polls, and top party donors are withholding their commitments.\n\nOn Friday, a finance aide for Mr. Bush sent an email to contributors inviting them to a breakfast fund-raiser in Washington next month, with a plea for new donors. Sarah Corsaro, the staff member, wrote, \"Please note\u2014this is new money only.\" She explained, \"We are utilizing this event to drive in new funds\" for the next quarterly fund-raising disclosure.\n\nThe email suggests that in his initial push to raise money after announcing his candidacy in June, Mr. Bush maximized his support among backers in the Washington area capable of giving the $2,700 legally allowed. The campaign is now eager to add wealthy donors who have previously not contributed to Mr. Bush.\n\nThe co-chair committee for the $1,000-per-person breakfast indicates why Mr. Bush is so focused on finding new donors: it is a list heavy with family, friends, and former aides and loyalists to his father, brother, and himself.\n\nMr. Bush raised a combined $114 million for his campaign and \"super PAC\" in the first half of the year. However, with Donald J. Trump unexpectedly surging and Mr. Bush falling in Republican polls, some of the party's top money raisers are remaining on the fence in terms of supporting Mr. Bush.\n\nThis reluctance, and the prospect of a hard-fought Republican contest that could last well into 2016, has prompted Mr. Bush to institute cost-saving measures in his campaign. Some aides have seen their pay cut back as part of an effort to curtail spending.\n\nAdditionally, on Friday, three of the candidate's Florida fund-raising consultants left the campaign after apparently clashing with the new leadership team Mr. Bush installed in June. Mr. Bush's hard-charging campaign manager, Danny Diaz, has pushed staffers to work longer hours and be more cost-conscious.\n\nTim Miller, communications director for Mr. Bush, commented, \"Ann Herberger is his longtime fund-raising consultant in Florida. We have a full-time finance staff in Miami HQ, as well. These are consultants with multiple clients. We moved in a different direction.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Halts Funding to World Health Organization Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn April, the White House announced a decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) pending a review of the organization's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States, historically the largest funder of the WHO, is followed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe announcement has sparked a heated debate, with both sides presenting strong arguments. The WHO is a part of the United Nations, composed of and run by 194 member nations. Member states choose a delegation to represent the country in the World Health Assembly, and the Executive Board operationalizes policies set by the World Health Assembly.\n\nEstablished in 1948, the WHO has a history of successes, such as eradicating smallpox, and perceived failures, like its delayed response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014. The organization is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and functions through a collection of six semi-autonomous regional offices. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus serves as the Director-General of the WHO, currently in a five-year elected term.\n\nThe WHO is funded by assessed contributions and voluntary contributions. Assessed contributions are required of each member state, scaled by income and population. Voluntary contributions may be made by member states (in addition to assessed contributions) or by individual donors. As noted, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the second-largest funder of the WHO via voluntary contributions. Overall, voluntary contributions make up 80% of the total.\n\nThe WHO's objective is to monitor and coordinate activities related to health issues, including genetically modified foods, climate change, tobacco and drug use, and road safety.\n\nCriticism of the WHO's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been widespread, with particular concern over China's influential role in the information released during the early stages of the crisis. A new article in the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine states, \"Influence from powerful political donors, which has become most evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic, the global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system, nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the WHO.\"\n\nHowever, the White House's move to halt funding entirely during the pandemic has also been met with considerable criticism. In the analysis below, we'll walk through the key points made by proponents of halting funds and opponents to halting funds.\n\nBoth sides agree that the world needs effective and coordinated leadership to respond to global health crises. Proponents argue that halting WHO funding is necessary to address the missteps and clear political bias demonstrated by the WHO. Opponents of halting WHO funding say it's irresponsible to discontinue funding of the world's most influential health organization in the middle of a pandemic.",
    " Title: North Korea Agrees to Talks on Denuclearization with U.S. and South Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has expressed a willingness to engage in open-ended dialogue with the United States regarding denuclearization and normalizing relations, according to South Korean National Security Advisor Chung Eui-yong. This development follows unprecedented meetings in Pyongyang between high-level South Korean officials and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nKim Jong Un has also agreed to refrain from conducting nuclear and missile tests while engaging in dialogue with South Korea, as per Chung's statement after his return from the meetings. The North Korean leader has shown a desire to be recognized as the primary decision-maker in his government, according to an unnamed official with deep knowledge of North Korea.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump believes North Korea is sincere in its peace talks with South Korea, stating, \"I really believe they are sincere. I hope they are sincere. We'll find out.\" The U.S. will continue with joint military exercises with South Korea, as per a senior administration official.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un will meet for a summit at the demilitarized zone in April, with the two sides opening a hotline for direct communication between the leaders. The April summit will take place at Panmunjom Peace House on the South Korean side of the demilitarized zone.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea expect to proceed with their joint military exercises, but it is unclear if Tuesday's developments will alter that. During the Tuesday meeting, Kim Jong Un expressed understanding of South Korea's position on the military drills.\n\nThe U.S. is looking for North Korea to take concrete actions or \"credible moves\" toward denuclearization before agreeing to direct talks, according to a senior administration official. The official indicated that a North Korean pledge to stop testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles would not suffice if North Korea privately continues to develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nThe U.S. has long maintained a policy of bringing \"intensifying economic and diplomatic pressure\" to bear until North Korea completely and verifiably abandons its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program, as stated by Vice President Mike Pence last month.\n\nThe announcement represents a significant diplomatic accomplishment for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has been a proponent of dialogue and engagement with North Korea since his days as a presidential aide to former President Roh Moo-hyun. The detente brought about by the Olympic diplomacy offered Moon an opportunity to dispatch a high-level delegation to Pyongyang, where they met with Kim Jong Un and some of his top aides, including his sister, Kim Yo Jong.\n\nThe April summit will mark the first inter-Korean summit since 2007, when South Korean President Roh met Kim Jong Un's father, late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Though surprising, the statements from North Korea are not a complete U-turn, as Pyongyang has long maintained its development of nuclear weapons is a response to what it calls the U.S.'s \"hostile policy\" toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name.\n\nExperts have noted that the statements from North Korea reiterate its longstanding position, but the context and timing matter, and this opens up the opportunity for more diplomacy. The U.S. and South Korea had postponed joint military exercises during the Winter Olympics but the drills had been expected to resume after the Paralympics end later this month. It is unclear whether Tuesday's developments will alter that.",

The violence, which took place between February 24 and 27, resulted in the deaths of 52 people, mostly Muslims, and caused significant property damage and destruction of religious structures.\n\nThe opposition Congress party members of Parliament walked out after Home Minister Amit Shah praised the police for ending the rioting in northeastern areas of the capital within 36 hours and preventing it from spreading across New Delhi. The violence followed a series of anti-Muslim hate speeches by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including Kapil Mishra, who warned Muslims protesting against a new citizenship law to wind down their sit-ins in northeast Delhi.\n\nAsaduddin Owaisi, the chief of the opposition All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party, accused the governing BJP of spreading hatred against Muslims, the country's largest minority. \"What is my dignity when 19 mosques have been destroyed or damaged? What is my dignity when I see a saffron flag being erected on a mosque?\" Owaisi said during his speech, referring to the flag associated with Hindu far-right groups planted on a mosque minaret during the violence.\n\nOpposition Congress party leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary accused the police of ignoring hundreds of distress calls from people who were under attack and failing to protect them. \"In light of the scale of violence and consequent loss of lives and property, we strongly demand the resignation of the home minister,\" he said.\n\nThe Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), passed last December, fast-tracks naturalization for minorities of all major faiths in South Asia except Islam. Muslims and liberal Indians say it is against the officially secular nation's constitution and is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agenda of Hindu supremacy.\n\nHome Minister Amit Shah, in a statement to the lower house of the Indian Parliament, assured strict action would be taken against the perpetrators of violence and offered his condolences to the families of those killed during the riots. He blamed inflammatory speeches by the Congress party and some Muslim leaders for triggering the rioting. He declined to say how many were Hindus or Muslims but media reports say most of those killed were Muslims.\n\nMuslims have reportedly suffered most of the damages to their properties and religious structures, with many of them living in relief camps. BJP member of Parliament Meenakshi Lekhi accused a little-known Islamist organization and elements of the ISIL (ISIS) group of organizing the violence. She also alleged that US financier and philanthropist George Soros pledged to donate $1bn to finish India's nationalism.\n\nIn light of the scale of violence and consequent loss of lives and property, we strongly demand the resignation of the home minister. Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, Congress party leader.\n\nAnother senior Congress leader, Kapil Sibal, accused the government of protecting the guilty. \"We know what will happen. You will punish the innocent and give protection to the guilty. Even when you know who the accused are, no FIRs are filed. Don't let such a thing happen,\" Sibal said in Parliament.\n\nOwaisi, the member of Parliament from Hyderabad, accused the government of failing in discharging its constitutional duties to save the lives of Indians. \"Do you have any remorse on your faces? Do you have any embarrassment for what has happened right under your nose? No. You have no embarrassment, you take pride on the dead bodies, which are lying in drains,\" said Owaisi, who has emerged as a leading voice of Indian Muslims.\n\nOwaisi also accused the government of presiding over two pogroms, referring to the Gujarat 2002 pogrom when more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed under Modi's chief ministership. Prime Minister Modi and his close aide Shah have not visited the violence-affected areas of Delhi, with Modi's only comment being a call for calm on his Twitter handle.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Leaders Criticize Democrats for Delaying Paycheck Protection Program Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) have criticized Democrats and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for refusing to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) of the CARES Act, which is expected to run out of funding in a matter of hours.\n\nIn a statement, the two leaders stated, \"The Small Business Administration and the Department of the Treasury report that the Paycheck Protection Program will exhaust its funding in a matter of hours. It will have to stop accepting applications for job-saving loans.\"\n\nAs of late Wednesday, the Small Business Administration had approved over 1.5 million loans valued at more than $324 billion, with loans still being processed. Both Democrats and Republicans want to add $250 billion to the small-business aid program, but have been sparring over whether to add restrictions to the funds.\n\nDemocrats have proposed expanding access to the loans and including more money for hospitals, food assistance, and state and local governments. Republicans, on the other hand, want to keep the bill focused on increasing small-business aid and defer other funding debates until the next, broader legislation is crafted.\n\nThe leaders' statement continued, \"This did not have to happen. Republicans have been sounding the alarm for more than a week. Last Thursday, Senate Republicans tried to pass a narrow and clean bill that would have simply put more money into this critical program without changing any of the underlying policies that passed the Senate and the House unanimously. Democrats blocked it.\"\n\nThe news comes as large swaths of the American economy have been effectively closed for the last few weeks due to the coronavirus outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China. The U.S., which has led the world in widespread testing, has nearly 630,000 confirmed cases and over 25,000 reported deaths from the virus. The hardest-hit states in the U.S. are New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, and California. The New York City area has been the hardest-hit area in the country, accounting for nearly one-third of all the coronavirus cases in the U.S. and nearly half the deaths in the U.S.\n\nThe statement concluded, \"It has been stunning to watch our Democratic colleagues treat emergency funding for Americans' paychecks like a Republican priority which they need to be goaded into supporting. Funding a bipartisan program should not be a partisan issue. The notion that crucial help for working people is not appealing enough to Democrats without other additions sends a strange message about their priorities.\"\n\nThe leaders called for Democrats to see reason soon and finally heed Republicans' repeated calls for a funding bill that can quickly earn unanimous consent from all 100 senators and become law.",
    " Title: George Conway Expected to Head Civil Division of Department of Justice, Potentially Taking on Major Role in Trump Administration's Legal Defense\n\nArticle:\n\nGeorge Conway, the husband of Kellyanne Conway and a partner at the prestigious law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, is expected to be nominated to head the civil division of the Department of Justice, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. If confirmed by the Senate, Conway would be responsible for leading the defense of the Trump administration in lawsuits.\n\nThe expected nomination comes as the Justice Department prepares appeals of rulings that blocked President Trump's revised travel ban. The president has vowed to see his executive order through, even if it means bringing it to the Supreme Court. Such a move would put Conway in the midst of the ongoing legal debate surrounding the travel ban.\n\nThe executive order, which seeks to restrict travel from six predominantly Muslim nations, was blocked by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland last week. The Trump administration has argued that the ban is necessary to help fight terrorism. However, US District Judge Derrick Watson of Hawaii and US District Judge Theodore Chuang of Maryland found in two separate rulings that the order unfairly targets Muslim travelers.\n\nIn Hawaii, Judge Watson noted that courts should not examine \"secret motives\" of government officials, but said the intention of Trump's order was clear, citing \"significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus\" behind the ban, as reported by The \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nThe Trump administration filed court papers on Friday to challenge the Maryland ruling, setting up a new legal showdown in the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, located in Richmond, Virginia, according to the Chicago Tribune. Trump has vowed to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court to get the ban reinstated.\n\n\"We're going to win. We're going to keep our citizens safe,\" he said at a rally in Nashville last week. \"The danger is clear. The law is clear. The need for my executive order is clear.\"\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Conway would likely play a major role in the Justice Department's challenge in this case. Conway, a litigation partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, has seen success in the High Court before. In the 1990s, he wrote the Supreme Court brief in a sexual harassment lawsuit against former President Clinton, establishing a legal precedent for a sitting president to be sued in civil court. Clinton's denial of an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky during a deposition in the Paula Jones case led to the then-president's impeachment trial.\n\nConway, a graduate of Harvard University and Yale Law School, has also represented a long list of corporate clients. A respected Republican lawyer, Conway has represented Phillip Morris, Cardinal Health, and the National Football League. He also clerked for US Circuit Judge Ralph Winter, Jr. of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, who was nominated to the court by former President Reagan. According to Conway's biography on his firm's website, he has worked on major securities law cases and deal litigation.\n\nConway was previously considered for the post of solicitor general of the Justice Department, a position that ultimately went to Noel Francisco.\n\nKellyanne Conway, Conway's wife, has been an influential member of the Trump team since the election. A longtime Republican pollster, she is credited with helping turn around the Trump campaign when the candidate was trailing Hillary Clinton. After Trump's victory, Kellyanne joined the administration as a counselor to the president. She is also known for artfully defending the president in the press, but has been criticized for backing Trump's unsubstantiated claims, including his most recent allegation he was wiretapped by former President Obama.",
    " Title: Obama Emphasizes Free-Market Solutions and Government Role in Speech to Democratic Donors\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a fundraising event for Democratic Senate candidates in California on Thursday, President Barack Obama emphasized his administration's support for free-market solutions and a minimal approach to government regulation.\n\nSpeaking at a private home in Palo Alto, California, Obama stated, \"It turns out we're pretty common-sense folks. We believe in the free market, and a light touch when it comes to regulations.\"\n\nAccording to a report by the Heritage Foundation, the Obama administration adopted 106 \"major regulations\" that increased burdens on the private sector in its first three years, compared to 28 such regulations during the same timeframe of President George W. Bush's administration. A study by the left-leaning OMB Watch found that the total regulations adopted by the Obama administration are roughly equivalent to the number adopted by other administrations over the past 18 years.\n\nDuring the event, Obama also highlighted the need for a regulatory structure that encourages clean energy development and protects intellectual property. He emphasized the government's role in funding science, research, infrastructure, and education.\n\nObama appealed for a \"functioning government,\" stating that Republicans often engage in \"stubbornness.\" He argued that government plays a critical role in these areas, and for the accomplishment of these goals, he expressed the need for a Democratic Senate and House.\n\n\"For us to accomplish that,\" the president said, \"we're going to need to have a Democratic Senate. For us to accomplish that, I'd also like a Democratic House. I just want to get stuff done. On too much of the big stuff, what we see coming out of the other party is an interest in winning elections or in obstruction, not enough interest in solving problems.\"",
    " Title: Democrats Embrace Obamacare for 2014 Midterms, Aiming to Highlight Popular Elements\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of years of Republican criticism over the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Democrats have adopted an unexpected strategy for the 2014 midterm elections: embracing the contentious law. This new approach represents a significant shift from 2010, when Republicans used Obamacare as a key argument in their successful bid to seize control of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Democratic strategy, which reflects the party's recognition of their inextricable association with the law, is a high-stakes public relations gambit. The White House has historically struggled with messaging on Obamacare, hoping that the public would come to appreciate the healthcare overhaul as its benefits became apparent. However, this has not materialized, and Democrats now seem to be betting that the law's benefits will eventually become clear.\n\nThe strategy will be tested as the law is implemented and the public gains a closer look at the extensive undertaking, with potential issues and negative media coverage likely as the law unfolds in the months leading up to the election.\n\nCalifornia Representative Scott Peters, a freshman Democrat who narrowly won his election last year, expressed support for this approach. While he does not agree with every aspect of the law, he is not hesitant to discuss healthcare, stating, \"I don't have any problem talking about it. I think it's a big issue. I think it's going to be talked about more than immigration or guns.\"\n\nOne early indication of this shift can be seen in the response of Democratic incumbents from competitive districts to recent Republican attempts to repeal the healthcare law. In contrast to 2010, when Democratic congressional candidates in tough races actively opposed the law, they are now speaking out against Republican repeal efforts.\n\nWhile not every Democrat is expected to enthusiastically endorse the overhaul, Democratic strategists believe there are aspects of the law that are popular, such as coverage for pre-existing conditions, eliminating lifetime caps on coverage, and allowing children to remain on their parents' health plans until they are 26. These benefits are being emphasized by the party as they prepare for the 2014 elections.",
    " Title: New York's Work-from-Home Mandate Ignored by Montefiore Medical Center's Nonessential Staff at Rose F. Kennedy Children's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center\n\nArticle:\n\nDespite New York state's mandate encouraging companies to allow employees to work from home, the Montefiore Medical Center is continuing to have nonessential workers at the Rose F. Kennedy Children's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center (CERC) report to the office. This decision has raised concerns among the hospital workers themselves, who are primarily developmental pediatricians, psychologists, social workers, language and occupational therapists, and are connecting with patients via phone or video conferencing due to patients being advised to avoid in-person sessions.\n\nOne employee, who requested anonymity due to fear of repercussions at their job, stated, \"People are so frightened and really angry. It's dangerous. There have been tons of COVID-19 cases everywhere at this point, especially in New York, and there's a real lack of transparency here. We don't really know what we're walking into, even though there are constant reassurances that we're safe. It doesn't feel that way.\"\n\nCERC, one of the many clinics associated with Montefiore, focuses on helping children with language disorders, behavioral problems, and other disabilities. According to internal emails reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588, CERC considered its services as nonessential medical services as recently as March 11.\n\nInitially, CERC continued to demand these clinicians report to the office and work at full capacity until March 30, two weeks after Mayor Bill de Blasio closed down the New York City school system. Now, employees are instead commuting a few times per week, as opposed to every day. The employee \u2588\u2588\u2588 spoke to estimated that this likely affects as many as 150 people.\n\nThe employee expressed concern that they and others could potentially contract the coronavirus or spread it to others, as they didn't need to be leaving their homes to do their jobs. \"It's absurd,\" the employee said. \"Therapists are trying to figure out how to deliver therapy virtually all over the world. I understand it's difficult\u2014I do\u2014but other hospitals are doing that more effectively. We don't need to be here physically.\"\n\nOther New York hospitals, like the Mount Sinai Health System and NYU Langone Medical Center, appear to have been developing work-at-home measures for nonessential employees for close to a month. Montefiore did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nCERC has asserted in emails that Montefiore is \"on top of things\" and appropriately responding to the global pandemic. However, the center did not require its staff to wear masks at work until just last week, according to the employee, and it appeared to react slowly overall to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIt took until March 23 for the administration at CERC to announce in an email that Montefiore would allow the clinic to operate at \"a reduced workforce by 50%,\" which permitted \"all staff [to] work from home for a portion of each week.\" CERC has since taken further precautions, such as temperature checks of employees, and has advised people to wash their hands, avoid touching their faces, and stand at least six feet away from one another, according to an email. (It was unclear whether Montefiore or CERC itself was implementing these changes.)\n\nRegardless, nonessential hospital workers are still being asked to travel to work and operate on a staggered schedule\u2014either two or three days out of the work week. There, they isolate themselves in their offices, phones and computers in hand.\n\n\"Really, it's as if I don't know who is making decisions about my work or life right now,\" the employee said. \"It's so mysterious how these choices are even being made.\"",
    " Title: Potential Economic and Agricultural Consequences of U.S. Immigration Policy Changes\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has outlined plans to tighten immigration policies, with a focus on border security and the hiring of additional Border Patrol and ICE agents. These measures, as outlined in two memos, could have significant consequences for the U.S. agricultural sector.\n\nAccording to a study cited by Bloomberg, approximately 70% of the U.S. farm workforce lacks valid immigration papers. The potential removal of undocumented workers could lead to a significant labor shortage, as American citizens may not be willing or available to take on farm work. This labor shortage could result in a 40% increase in wages, a burden that the farm industry, which is expected to see profits decline for the fourth year in a row, may struggle to bear without passing on increased costs to consumers.\n\nIf legal guest-worker programs do not expand to accommodate the labor shortage, farm operations may be forced to shut down, as noted by Zaid Kurdieh of Norwich Meadows Farm.\n\nFurthermore, a study commissioned by the American Farm Bureau Federation in 2014 suggests that an immigration policy focused on border control could shift as much as 61% of U.S. fruit production to other countries and create jobs in neighboring nations such as Mexico. This shift is due to the higher wage costs making U.S. food production less competitive.\n\nThese potential consequences highlight the complex interplay between immigration policy and the agricultural sector. The administration's focus on border security and immigration enforcement may lead to labor shortages, increased wages, and a potential shift in agricultural production to other countries.",

His views on the issue contrast sharply with his approach towards the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLast year, Cuomo signed into law the most liberal abortion law in the country, stating, \"Today we are taking a giant step forward in the hard-fought battle to ensure a woman\u2019s right to make her own decisions about her own personal health, including the ability to access an abortion.\" He further added, \"With the signing of this bill, we are sending a clear message that whatever happens in Washington, women in New York will always have the fundamental right to control their own body.\"\n\nCuomo's justification for abortion rights includes the argument that women need them to have careers. This line of reasoning, however, is not applied to the elderly during the pandemic, as he stated this week that he would not put the \"elderly at risk\" in order to \"boost the economy.\"\n\nNew York is responsible for many of the abortions in America today. In a press conference this week, Cuomo said, \"My mother is not expendable and your mother is not expendable and our brothers and sisters are not expendable, and we\u2019re not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable, and we\u2019re not going to put a dollar figure on human life.\"\n\nCritics argue that Cuomo's stance on abortion and the elderly reveals an inconsistent ethic of life, with the unborn being considered highly \"expendable\" while the elderly are not.

The incident occurred approximately 10 minutes after the Obama family had departed for a weekend at Camp David in Maryland.\n\nThe intrusion led to the evacuation of the West Wing, and White House spokesman Frank Benenati stated, \"The president has full confidence in the Secret Service and is grateful to the men and women who day in and day out protect himself, his family, and the White House.\"\n\nRep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) commented on Fox News Sunday, stating, \"I have great respect for the Secret Service, but this is absolutely unacceptable.\" He called for a full investigation into the incident.\n\nOn Friday, Omar Gonzalez, a 42-year-old man from Copperas Cove, Texas, managed to jump the fence on Pennsylvania Avenue and run approximately 70 yards to the White House before being subdued. He has been charged with unlawful entry into restricted grounds while carrying a deadly weapon.\n\nGonzalez enlisted in the Army in July 1997 and was assigned to the 10th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, at Fort Hood, Texas. He was discharged in September 2003 after completing his service obligation. Gonzalez enlisted again in July 2005 and served until his retirement in late 2012.\n\nThe Secret Service did not open fire on the intruder nor release guard dogs during the incident. According to a criminal complaint against Gonzalez, he told the Secret Service he was \"concerned that the atmosphere was collapsing\" and needed to contact the president \"so he could get word out to the people.\"\n\nThe Secret Service has ordered an investigation by its Office of Professional Responsibility and has increased patrols and surveillance capabilities along the Pennsylvania Avenue fence line around the White House complex.

This observation comes as Amy Klobuchar, the U.S. Senator from Minnesota, has been receiving increased attention.\n\nKlobuchar's campaign advisor, Smith, questioned the validity of the recent media attention, suggesting it is driven by a desire for something new and different. He noted that while Klobuchar has seen a slight increase in poll numbers, she has not raised significant funds or garnered many endorsements, but has received more media coverage.\n\nIn the last three polls conducted in New Hampshire, Klobuchar has averaged two percent. Smith suggested that due to a lack of campaign resources, Klobuchar's campaign is relying on a late surge in support.\n\nIn an interview, Klobuchar expressed confidence in her ability to appeal to rural, independent voters in New Hampshire, similar to her home state of Minnesota. She believes that as more people become familiar with her, her poll numbers will increase.\n\nKlobuchar's campaign style is described as familiar and easy to digest, akin to her favorite lunchtime meal: a baked potato. Former state Representative Jay Phinizy, an early Klobuchar supporter, praised her practical approach to politics and her experience in the Senate.\n\nKlobuchar frequently invokes the names of New Hampshire's popular senators, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen, during her campaign speeches. She has developed a close relationship with Hassan, playing the New York Times mini-crossword puzzle with her daily.\n\nKlobuchar's campaign style and substance closely match those of Hassan and Shaheen on the stump. All three senators generally avoid rah-rah rhetoric and instead focus on calmly highlighting their accomplishments in Congress. They do not support versions of Medicare for All or free college for all being proposed by the more liberal wing of the party.\n\nWhile Klobuchar does not mention this detail in her stump speech, she is willing to discuss the impracticality of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders' plans if a voter asks.\n\nKlobuchar's supporters hope she is experiencing a wave of support rather than a peak. Former state Attorney General Joe Foster, who chose Klobuchar after seeing 14 candidates, believes she is gaining attention at the right time.",
    " Title: Americans Prefer a Less Polarized Congress, Reuters-Ipsos Poll Reveals\n\nArticle:\n\nA new Reuters-Ipsos poll indicates that a majority of Americans believe Congress is more effective when political extremists have less influence. The survey, conducted May 4-12, found that 57 percent of respondents agreed that Congress is more effective when extremists on either side do not have as much leverage, while 22 percent disagreed.\n\nThe poll results reinforce the idea that the 2014 elections were driven by a desire for more effective government. Penny Mahar, a political independent from Whitesboro, New York, one of the poll respondents, stated, \"It's much too polarized, too political now. Once, when somebody was elected to Congress, they would work with the opposite party to try to make things better for their country. Now they seem more focused on their party than the needs of the people.\"\n\nCongress has become slightly more productive in the last few months, with voters awarding majorities to Republicans in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Bipartisan legislation to rework the pay formula for Medicare doctors was passed last month and signed into law by President Barack Obama. The Senate passed a bipartisan bill on May 7 allowing Congress to review a nuclear deal with Iran, and the House passed the measure on Thursday. There has been no government shutdown since October 2013.\n\nDespite these legislative accomplishments, 53 percent of Americans still hold an unfavorable view of Congress, with 47 percent holding a favorable view. These views have not changed over the past six months for three-fifths of those polled.\n\nMike Helferd, also an independent from Hilton Head, South Carolina, stated, \"Every once in a while they get something through in spite of themselves.\" Several respondents told a Reuters reporter they had not heard about the recent legislative accomplishments. Most poll respondents, 71 percent, said they viewed Congress as either \"mostly\" or \"completely\" dysfunctional.\n\nSarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said the distaste for extremism shown in the poll reflected the \"general moderation\" of the U.S. public. \"Despite a more polarized electorate, voters tend to be more moderate than the politicians that they elect to Congress. So it makes sense that a majority would say that Congress is more effective when extremists are marginalized,\" she said.\n\nThe poll did not define \"extremists.\" Some respondents, when asked by Reuters to name groups they considered extremist, suggested Tea Party conservatives or, on the other side of the political spectrum, \"ultra-liberals.\"\n\nSome poll respondents saw reason to hope for more agreement and productivity from Congress soon. Helferd stated, \"They are so vociferously anti-anything that is not part of their platform, I think they are losing popularity.\" Mahar hoped Senator Chuck Schumer, expected to become the chamber's next Democratic leader, will work with Republicans to get things done. \"Harry Reid, the current Senate Democratic leader, 'wouldn't move anything,' she said. 'Everything stayed on his desk.'\"",
    " Title: Fox News Anchors' Interviews Pose Challenges for Republican Presidential Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nBill Scher, senior writer at the Campaign for America's Future and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \"The DMZ,\" has pointed out that the Republican National Committee's decision to control the debates last year, aiming to keep their candidates in a conservative environment, may have backfired. The first Republican presidential debate will air on Fox News and will be moderated by Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and Chris Wallace, who have already caused three Republican candidates to stumble with embarrassing gaffes this month.\n\nIn 2012, the RNC sought to install more \"conservatives in the moderator's chair\" to avoid the perceived bias of some 2012 primary debate moderators. Instances such as ABC's George Stephanopoulos questioning Mitt Romney on states' rights to ban contraception and CNN's John King asking Newt Gingrich about his ex-wife's allegations were criticized by conservatives as irrelevant and biased questions.\n\nHowever, this year, when Republican candidates make mistakes on the debate stage, they will not have the option to blame the media. The recent gaffes by Republican candidates on Fox News are not due to the Fox News journalists being out to get Republicans, but rather because even softball questions can trip up a candidate not ready for prime time.\n\nFor example, Megyn Kelly's interview of Jeb Bush was described as the journalistic equivalent of a warm hug. Her question about the Iraq invasion was only a couple of notches tougher than Katie Couric's \"What newspapers and magazines did you regularly read?\" After Bush's initial answer, Kelly asked for a clarification, and the conversation moved on to a new line of questioning.\n\nThe Iraq question sparked a media firestorm, with rivals Chris Christie and Ted Cruz, both fervent hawks, stating they would not have invaded. Influential conservative radio talker Laura Ingraham was incredulous, stating, \"You have to have [a nominee] who says, 'Look, I'm a Republican but I'm not an idiot... I learn from the past.'\"\n\nChris Wallace's recent interview with Marco Rubio was more aggressive, pressing Rubio on his abandonment of the Senate immigration bill for which he voted and his shifting foreign policy rhetoric. Wallace also grilled Rubio on his Iraq stance, asking him seven times, \"Was it a mistake?\"\n\nIf Wallace were not working for Rupert Murdoch, his loaded questions, opinionated assertions, and repeated interruptions would earn him a lifetime membership in the Liberal Media Elite Club. Candidates who expect to get a free ride from Wallace will quickly become debate roadkill.",
    " Title: Trump's Re-election Challenges: A Fact-Based Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe focus of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election is not solely on whether Donald Trump can defeat Joe Biden, but also on his ability to overcome challenges posed by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, a potential economic recession, and a few swing voters who may be growing weary of Trump's unpredictable leadership.\n\nWhile Republicans may criticize Biden for perceived weaknesses such as senility, fragility, and confusion, these attacks may not be decisive, as Democrats and independents are the primary concerns for Trump. In the 2016 election, Trump won critical states like Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, but failed to secure 50% of the vote in any of these states. Trump's margin of error is slim.\n\nCriticizing Biden's gaffes is not a novel concept, similar to criticizing Trump's spelling or personal conduct. Biden's political comeback saw him outmaneuvering his primary opponents, leaving only Bernie Sanders as a significant challenger. Biden's campaign, representing a powerful Democratic machine, is expected to gain strength as the Sanders faction reconciles its discontent with the Democratic National Committee.\n\nBiden has garnered support from African American voters and decisively beat Sanders among new Democratic voters. He is also expected to secure the support of Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, and possibly Bernie Sanders, as well as Michael Bloomberg's financial resources.\n\nTrump's boasts of high share prices and low unemployment prior to the coronavirus pandemic are no longer relevant, as the stock market has plunged 20% in response to the virus and the administration's handling of it. Trump's inaccurate statements about the coronavirus response, such as the insurance companies waiving copays for treatment or a complete travel ban from Europe, undermine his credibility in portraying Biden as confused and out-of-touch.\n\nEconomic growth, already falling short of Trump's promised 3% steady growth, is now being affected by disruptions in worldwide supply chains and declines in travel, trade, and tourism. As of March 11, Trump's national disapproval rating, according to the traditionally right-leaning Rasmussen poll, is 52%, compared to 47% approval.\n\nThe coronavirus presents a new type of political challenge for Trump, one he cannot bully or buy off as he did with fellow Republicans or farmers affected by his trade war with China. The pandemic is a test of Trump's executive competence, and, so far, he has been found wanting.\n\nIf the economic situation worsens and leads to a significant contraction, Trump will need to offer more than his current apologists' response: \"The buck stops elsewhere.\"\n\nKevin D. Williamson, author of \"The Smallest Minority: Independent Thinking in the Age of Mob Politics,\" provides insight into the challenges Trump faces in the 2020 election.",
    " Title: Reindeer's Unique Features Make Them Ideal for Santa's Sleigh\n\nArticle:\n\nThe choice of reindeer as Santa Claus's sleigh pullers in the popular poem \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\" in 1823 was not a mere coincidence. Reindeer's unique adaptations to their Arctic habitat make them the perfect candidates for the role.\n\nReindeer's hooves, for instance, have the ability to grow and shrink depending on the season. In colder weather, the pads on their feet shrink, revealing the rim of their hooves, providing the necessary traction and grip to navigate icy and snowy terrain. In warmer months, the pads on their feet expand and soften, offering a strong grip on wet ground. Additionally, their hooves are shaped like shovels, allowing them to dig through snow to access food sources beneath.\n\nReindeer's speed and stamina are also noteworthy. They can trot at 25 miles per hour and double their speed if necessary to escape predators. They have been recorded traveling 500 air miles in six weeks across varied terrain. With such speed and endurance, reindeer make reliable sleigh companions.\n\nDespite their bulky appearance, reindeer are strong swimmers. During their migratory periods, they often have to cross wide bodies of water to access new areas. In the water, adult reindeer can keep pace at 4 miles per hour, or even swim comfortably at 6 miles per hour if they're in a hurry.\n\nAnother advantage of reindeer is their lack of an internal body clock. This adaptation allows them to cope with the extreme changes in daylight hours in the Arctic. Research teams from the universities of Manchester and Tromso found that reindeer do not release melatonin, the hormone that helps animals respond to the cycles of light and dark and sleep at the right time. Without an internal body clock, reindeer can respond to their own needs without their bodies being influenced by the seasons. This feature is particularly useful for global travel, as it means reindeer would not experience jet lag.\n\nWith their adaptable hooves, speed, and ability to avoid the effects of jet lag, reindeer are indeed the perfect choice as a Christmas travel companion.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Plans to Alter Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, signed into law in March 2010 under President Barack Obama, has been a contentious topic throughout the 2016 election. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump consistently expressed his intention to repeal Obamacare. However, following a meeting with President Obama, Trump's stance has softened, and he now aims to revise the legislation rather than fully repeal it.\n\nSince the election, the Trump administration and Republican leaders have been preparing to make changes to the healthcare system. In the days following the election, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated that repealing Obamacare is a high priority for the Republican agenda. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for a replacement due to the perceived failures of the current system.\n\nPresident-elect Trump reportedly considered convening a \"special session\" on Inauguration Day to discuss health-care reform. The changes to Obamacare, which played a significant role in Trump's election, could present challenges for the Trump administration. The Republicans will be under pressure to address the $3 trillion U.S. health-care system, which they have criticized for years, and risk potential backlash if the insurance market is disrupted and millions of Americans lose coverage.\n\nFormer President Obama has already expressed caution about the potential consequences of altering the healthcare sector, stating that the American people will respond negatively if the health-care system is disrupted. Obama warned that the hard part will come when governance begins, as the new administration will be tasked with addressing the complexities of the U.S. health-care system.",
    " Title: GOP Faces Internal Struggle as Tea Party and Mainstream Republicans Clash\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party is currently experiencing an internal power struggle between the Tea Party and mainstream Republicans, as evidenced by recent events and statements from key party members. This conflict, which has been ongoing for several years, has led to a divide within the party and has impacted its political strategy and electoral prospects.\n\nThe latest development in this power struggle was House Speaker John Boehner's criticism of conservative political action groups like FreedomWorks and Heritage Action. Boehner, who has historically avoided confronting the Tea Party wing of the party, expressed his disapproval of these groups' influence on members of Congress, particularly in relation to the budget deal worked out by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA).\n\nBoehner's comments, which were described as \"unusually harsh,\" were a departure from his previous approach towards the Tea Party. This shift in tone was particularly notable in light of the government shutdown in 2013, which was initiated by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) over Obamacare.\n\nThe Ryan-Murray budget deal, which was approved by 169 Republicans and Democrats, marked a significant shift in the party's stance, as a majority of Republicans rejected the political absolutism encouraged by the professional right. This move towards compromise has been interpreted as a response to the toxic political environment that has hindered Congress for years.\n\nThe 2014 mid-term elections are approaching, and the Republican Party is facing challenges from within as they aim to take over as the Senate majority. However, the party's chances of achieving this goal may be hindered if they nominate weak candidates, as eight of the 12 GOP incumbent Senators seeking re-election face primary challenges.\n\nTwo of the most prominent Republican Senators facing primary challenges are Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Minority Whip John Cornyn of Texas. McConnell is being challenged by businessman Matt Bevin, who claims the five-term incumbent is not conservative enough. Cornyn is being challenged by US Rep. Steve Stockman, an ally of Sen. Cruz who brought right-wing rocker Ted Nugent to President Obama's State of the Union address.\n\nMcConnell has expressed his support for the Tea Party movement but has criticized the Senate Conservatives Fund, which backs Bevin and was instrumental in the government shutdown over Obamacare. McConnell has accused the Senate Conservatives Fund of ruining the Republican brand and participating in the party's weakening.\n\nThe internal conflict within the Republican Party has been compared to a crossroads faced by the party a century ago, as described by Thomas Patterson in a Politico magazine piece. Patterson warns of a showdown between the Tea Party-driven right wing and the less sharply defined center-right faction. If the reactionary wing prevails and fails to accommodate the party's moderates, the Republican Party could cement its place as the 21st century's permanent minority party.\n\nThis internal struggle within the Republican Party is a significant development in American politics and will likely impact the party's strategy and electoral prospects in the coming years.",
    " Title: Wealth of Trump Administration's Senior Staff and Cabinet Estimated at $12 Billion, Kushner's Conflict of Interest Plan Criticized\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is reportedly the wealthiest in American history, with senior staff and cabinet members estimated to be worth $12 billion, according to a tally by Bloomberg. Detailed information about the wealth of these officials will be revealed in Friday's filings.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, earned at least $1.18 million, with nearly half of that amount coming from the Republican National Committee, which he previously led. His assets totaled between $604,008 and at least $1.26 million.\n\nSean Spicer, the White House press secretary, stated, \"I think one of the really interesting things that people are going to see today\u2014and I think it's something that should be celebrated\u2014is that the president has brought a lot of people into this administration, and this White House in particular, who have been very blessed and very successful.\" He added, \"These officials have given up a lot to come into government by setting aside a lot of assets.\"\n\nUntil January, Jared Kushner was the chief executive of Kushner Companies, a family-run real estate investment firm with holdings across the country. The business has been involved in at least $7 billion of acquisitions over the past decade.\n\nLate Friday, the White House released details of the plan devised by Kushner's advisers to avoid conflicts of interest between Kushner's government role and the wide-ranging business empire he ran with his father. That business depends on foreign investment from undisclosed sources, as well as billions of dollars in loans from the world's biggest financial services firms.\n\nAlthough Kushner has stepped down from his management positions at the more than 200 entities that operated aspects of the family real estate business, he will remain a beneficiary of a vast majority of the business he ran for the past decade, through a series of trusts that already owned the various real estate companies.\n\nThe plan laid out on Friday \"is not sufficient,\" said Larry Noble, a former general counsel and chief ethics officer for the Federal Election Commission. \"While removing himself from the management of the businesses is an important step, he is still financially benefiting from how the businesses do. This presents potential for a conflict of interest. Given his level in the White House and broad portfolio, it's hard to see how he will recuse himself from everything that may impact his financial interest.\"\n\nWhile the filing discloses Kushner's personal lenders, it does not provide information on his business partners or lenders to his projects.",
    " Title: Obama Proposes $100 Million for Human Brain Research Program\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama on Tuesday announced a proposed $100 million spending on a human brain research program, which he believes could lead to new treatments for conditions such as autism, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury.\n\nAddressing scientists and researchers at the White House, Obama stated, \"As humans, we can identify galaxies light-years away, we can study particles smaller than an atom, but we still haven't unlocked the mystery of the 3 pounds of matter that sits between our ears.\"\n\nThe proposal, to be included in Obama's federal budget next week, aims to increase studies into brain function with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Defense Department, and the National Science Foundation.\n\nObama emphasized that despite the \"sequester\" budget cuts that took effect in March, the nation should not cut back on scientific research. He said, \"Ideas are what power our economy. It's so important that we think about basic research generally as a driver of growth, and that we replace the across-the-board budget cuts that are threatening to set us back before we even get started.\"\n\nThe White House has named the program the Brain Initiative (Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies). It follows up on Obama's State of the Union address, where he called for more investment in research and development.\n\nThe NIH will establish a working group co-chaired by Dr. Cornelia Bargmann of Rockefeller University and Dr. William Newsome of Stanford University to define scientific goals for the NIH's investment and to develop a multiyear scientific plan for achieving these goals.\n\nObama acknowledged that government-funded research projects \"don't always pay off.\" However, he added, \"When they do, they change our lives in ways that we could never have imagined.\" He pointed to the Internet and computer chips as examples of successful government-funded research.\n\nThe president expressed optimism about the potential benefits of the Brain Initiative, stating, \"Imagine if we could reverse traumatic brain injury or [post-traumatic stress disorders] for our veterans who are coming home. What if computers could respond to our thoughts, or our language barriers could come tumbling down?\"\n\nHe suggested that the most promising developments would likely come in the field of medicine. \"We're still unable to cure diseases like Alzheimer's or autism, or fully reverse the effects of a stroke,\" the president said. \"The Brain Initiative will change that by giving scientists the tools they need to get a dynamic picture of the brain in action and better understand how we think and how we learn and remember. That knowledge could be, will be, transformative.\"",
    " Title: Congress Faces Government Shutdown as Border Wall Funding Negotiations Stall\n\nArticle:\n\nMembers of Congress are racing against a Friday deadline to pass the final 25 percent of government funding for fiscal 2019 to avoid a government shutdown. After months of negotiations, a deal for $1.6 billion in border wall funding as part of a full Homeland Security spending bill was proposed by Republican senators, but was rejected by Democrats.\n\nThe Republican offer, which would not pass either chamber according to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, included $1.6 billion in border wall funding and an additional $1 billion that Democrats called a \"slush fund\" that President Trump could use for his immigration policies.\n\nWith no long-term solution apparent, leaders of both parties are looking to a stopgap bill, or \"continuing resolution,\" to keep government functions going into January. Departments affected by the potential shutdown include Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, Justice, Treasury, and Homeland Security.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who expressed bipartisan support for avoiding a government shutdown, blamed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for the demise of Tuesday's deal. Pelosi, however, said the deal McConnell offered included not only $1.6 billion in border wall money, but also the additional $1 billion \"slush fund.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, the next scheduled votes in the House are not scheduled until two days before the funding deadline. While the border funding has been the major public sticking point, lawmakers said some other matters remain unresolved in the spending battle, including funding for ICE detention and enforcement, language tied to a new citizenship question the administration is pushing to include in the 2020 Census, and potential legislation intended to prevent U.S. companies from participating in the anti-Israel \"Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions\" (BDS) movement.\n\nAll sides seemed to think these matters would be resolved once the border funding is settled. Senator James Lankford, chairman of a general government/financial services spending subcommittee, said outstanding issues in that spending bill were finished or \"extremely close\" to being done. However, he declined to provide details, citing ongoing negotiations behind the scenes.",
    " Title: Criticism of Tulsi Gabbard's Presidential Campaign and Foreign Policy Stances Faces Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nThe presidential campaign of Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, is facing criticism from both political sides, with Hillary Clinton accusing Gabbard of being a tool of the Russians and her foreign policy stances being questioned.\n\nClinton, the former U.S. Secretary of State, has criticized Gabbard for her unnatural fluency with Syrian and Russian talking points, as well as her repeated echoing of pro-Assad propaganda. Clinton's accusation that Gabbard is a tool of the Russians was met with criticism for its bluntness and lack of proof.\n\nVan Jones, an Obama administration official and current CNN commentator, called Clinton's comments \"disinformation\" on the network Friday. Jones stated, \"I do not want someone of her stature to legitimate these attacks against anybody. If you've got real evidence, come forward with it. But if you're just going to smear people casually on podcasts, you are playing right into the Russians' hands.\"\n\nGabbard's foreign policy views, such as her isolationist stance and support for drug decriminalization, have drawn praise from the alt-right, white nationalists, libertarian activists, and some of President Trump's biggest boosters. Gabbard's stances have also been a topic of discussion on the notoriously toxic online message board 4chan, where some right-wing trolls and anti-Semites fawn over Gabbard.\n\nSome of those who have worked with Gabbard say that she represents viewpoints that draw support from an array of people in the United States as well as abroad. However, Democrats are on high alert about foreign interference in the next election, and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is aware of the frequent mentions of Gabbard in Russian state news media. An independent analysis of the Russian news media found that RT, the Kremlin-backed news agency, mentioned Gabbard frequently for a candidate polling in single digits.\n\nThe DNC is also concerned about the potential for foreign interference in the 2020 election, as Gabbard has been a frequent topic of discussion in Russian state media. The very fact that a Russia misinformation campaign is in the public discourse hampers the democratic process by damaging public trust, according to the acting director of national intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the foreign policy concerns, Gabbard's stances on other issues have also been criticized. Some have accused her of downplaying the threat posed by odious regimes, such as Syria and Egypt, in order to enlist their support. Gabbard has also been criticized for her stance on Syria, with some accusing her of questioning whether Assad actually deployed chemical weapons against innocent Syrians.\n\nThe summary of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump's dealings with Ukraine has also brought renewed scrutiny to Gabbard's foreign policy stances. The call between Trump and Ukraine's president shows Trump using his conversation to pursue his pet, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, and engaging in a quid pro quo, asking Zelensky to assist him in pursuing those conspiracy theories in exchange for help to Ukraine. Trump's defenders have argued that the evidence is circumstantial, but circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence and can be enough to support impeachment. Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.",
    " Title: Senate Judiciary Chairman Grants Additional Extension for Christine Blasey Ford to Decide on Testifying\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has granted an additional extension for attorney Debra S. Katz and her client, Professor Christine Blasey Ford, to decide on whether they will testify in the ongoing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hearing. This extension comes after a series of deadlines and negotiations between the parties involved.\n\nInitially, Professor Ford and her counsel were given a 10:00 AM deadline on Friday to submit requests for testimony, including date, time, and other specifics. This deadline passed without a response. In response to this, Sen. Grassley announced on Friday evening that he was willing to give them more time until the aforementioned 10:00 PM deadline.\n\nHowever, Katz accused Sen. Grassley of establishing an \"arbitrary\" deadline and declined to comply with his request, instead asking for one more day. Sen. Grassley responded by saying, \"come to us or we come to you\" and implored Professor Ford to let the Senate Judiciary Committee know if she was willing to testify or not.\n\nAfter nearly two hours of no definitive response to Katz's latest request, Sen. Grassley tweeted his response, saying, \"I want to hear her\" and that he had decided to grant another extension. In a series of tweets, Sen. Grassley expressed his frustration, comparing himself to a second trombone player in the judiciary orchestra and Sen. Chuck Schumer as the conductor.\n\nUnder this framework, Katz and Professor Ford now have until 10:00 PM tonight to decide if they are willing to testify. The details of the hearing, including the date and time, have not been disclosed. This extension follows Professor Ford's allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her 36 years ago during a high school party, an allegation that has caused a significant delay in the confirmation process for Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination.",
    " Title: Marco Rubio Announces 2016 Republican Presidential Bid, Hires Leading GOP Fundraiser\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has officially announced his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. The Florida legislator has hired Anna Rogers, finance director for American Crossroads, Karl Rove's political advocacy group, to lead fundraising efforts for his campaign, aiming to raise at least $50 million.\n\nRubio's invitation to a gathering hosted by major Republican donors Charles and David Koch, along with his inclusion in a group of only four potential GOP candidates, signifies his strong standing within the party. Notable absentees from the event include Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush.\n\nRubio's potential to garner a larger share of the Latino vote in the general election is a significant advantage, given the party's past struggles with Hispanic voters. Although Rubio has recently distanced himself from some provisions of his previously stated plan providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, he has supported such a plan in the past.\n\nFlorida, as a swing state, is crucial in presidential elections, having played a decisive role in the 2000 race that gave George W. Bush the win over Al Gore. With California and New York solidly blue and Texas solidly red, Florida stands as the most significant battleground state.\n\nThe GOP presidential field is expected to be crowded, with only Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul having officially announced their candidacies so far. The Washington Post has referred to Rubio as the \"crown prince\" of the Tea Party movement, and he has earned perfect 100 ratings from the American Conservative Union.\n\nRubio has been touring to promote \"American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone,\" outlining his proposals for addressing economic security and income inequality. His rhetorical skills have been praised, and he was chosen to deliver the official Republican response to President Barack Obama's 2013 State of the Union address.\n\nBefore joining the U.S. Senate, Rubio served four terms in the Florida legislature and held positions as speaker of the House, majority leader, and majority whip. Those who question Rubio's potential after just one term in the Senate should remember that Barack Obama had been in the Senate barely two years when he announced his successful run for president.",

In December, the FBI reported a record number of gun background checks, and this trend continued into January.\n\nOn Wednesday, gun stocks rose, with Smith & Wesson Holding Co. (SWHC) and Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR) increasing approximately 4%. Sturm, Ruger's stock has risen 13% since the shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that left 20 children and six educators dead.\n\nRetailers specializing in guns have also seen growth. The stock price for Cabela's (CAB) surged 6% on Wednesday and has gained 20% over the last month. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS, Fortune 500) notched up slightly, and has gained 6% over the month.\n\nGun enthusiasts are stocking up on firearms, including assault rifles, in fear of potential future bans. Rommel Dionisio, gun industry analyst for Wedbush Securities, stated, \"Consumers are flocking to stores to purchase certain types of firearms, including assault rifles, in fears of some type of ban going forward.\"\n\nThis week, nearly 60,000 people will attend the annual SHOT Show in Las Vegas, one of the largest firearm trade shows in the country. Attendees are discussing the president's gun control proposals in response to mass shootings around the country.\n\nWhen asked about the assault rifle ban, one attendee noted, \"Banning one type of gun is not going to help. The Columbine shootings were with handguns and shotguns.\" Another attendee emphasized the need for stricter background checks and improved mental health evaluations.\n\nRegarding school security, many attendees suggested increased security measures, such as armed guards, as a solution. One attendee commented, \"It's crazy that you have security in all these places, but then you have 'Gun Free Zones' at schools.\"\n\nIn response to President Obama's calls for more gun control, the National Rifle Association (NRA) released the following statement:\n\n\"The NRA is focused on defending the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. We believe that the president's proposals would not effectively address criminal misuse of firearms and would only impact the law-abiding citizens who abide by the current laws. We will continue to advocate for responsible gun ownership and effective solutions to prevent gun violence.\"\n\nThe NRA has seen a significant increase in members following the Newtown tragedy. The 35th annual SHOT Show, which runs from January 14-17, is expected to attract over 60,000 attendees and 1,600 exhibitors. The show is open to professionals involved with the shooting sports, hunting, and law enforcement industries.",

However, this rate remains higher than before the recession. Median household income also increased by 5.2% to $56,516, one of the biggest increases in recent years, but still falls below the levels prior to the recession and the all-time peak reached in 1999.\n\nThe poverty rate among those aged 65 and older is only slightly higher than its record lows, but poverty among children and working-age people has yet to recover significantly. Among working-age people, poverty is about four percentage points higher than in 2000, while among children, it is about five percentage points higher.\n\nPoverty rates have improved for whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in recent years, but none have poverty rates that have returned to their record lows. While 13.5% of Americans live below the poverty line, an additional 18% have incomes only slightly higher. Families with incomes above the poverty line but below certain thresholds could still face economic difficulties, especially in areas with a high cost of living.\n\nIncome inequality continues to be a significant issue, with an increasing share of income going to households in the top 20%. Household incomes at the 80th, 90th, and 95th percentile have never been higher. The past 25 years have also seen a growing split between households with different levels of educational attainment. The median household led by someone with a master's degree earns $7,655 more per year than in 1991, while those with some college but no degree earn $7,768 less, and those with a high-school diploma but no further education earn $6,316 less.\n\nThe median Asian family earns $14,000 more than the median white family, which earns nearly $18,000 more than the median Hispanic family, which in turn earns about $8,000 more than the median black family.",
    " Title: FBI to Conduct Limited One-Week Review of Brett Kavanaugh's Background Amid Sexual Assault Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been authorized by President Donald Trump to conduct a limited one-week review of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's background, following allegations of sexual assault leveled by high school acquaintance Christine Blasey Ford. This move comes after a contentious Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that failed to reconcile the conflicting accounts of Ford and Kavanaugh.\n\nThe FBI's investigation will likely focus on Ford's allegations that Kavanaugh assaulted her at a house party in the Washington, D.C. suburbs in 1982. Among the first witnesses to be contacted by investigators is Kavanaugh's high school friend, Mark Judge, who Ford claims was in the room during the alleged incident.\n\nIn her testimony, Ford identified two other individuals who were allegedly present at the party, P.J. Smyth and Leland Ingham Keyser. Both have issued statements indicating they have no recollection of the party. Former FBI agent Jim Davis, who participated in at least 50 such background inquiries, stated that all individuals identified as being present at the party, as well as those Ford told of the incident, would likely be interviewed.\n\nPrior to Thursday's hearing, Ford's attorneys provided the Senate committee with sworn declarations from four people, including Ford's husband, who said that Ford had shared details of the incident and Kavanaugh's alleged involvement with them. Ford's husband, Russell Ford, stated that he first learned of his wife's experience with sexual assault \"around the time we got married.\" However, he said Ford did not share details of the incident until a couple's therapy session in 2012.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the scope of the FBI's inquiry will allow for the review of other allegations leveled by former Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, who claimed that Kavanaugh exposed himself at a drunken party during the 1983-84 academic year, or by Julie Swetnick, who has alleged that in the 1980s she witnessed Kavanaugh and Judge attempt to ply teenage girls with alcohol at wild parties where girls were sexually abused. Swetnick did not say Kavanaugh or Judge sexually assaulted her.\n\nIn his statement Friday, Judge said he did not recall attending the parties. \"The allegations in the Swetnick affidavit are so bizarre that, even while suffering from my addiction, I would remember actions so outlandish,\" he said, categorically denying the allegations.\n\nRay Mey, a former FBI agent who conducted dozens of background checks during his tenure at the bureau, stated, \"The FBI has more than enough resources to do this in a week.\" However, he expressed concern that the investigation may not result in a positive outcome for any party involved. \"If they do not find anything, the other side will say it's a cover-up,\" Mey said. \"Either way, the bureau does not gain anything.\"",
    " Title: University of Illinois Researcher Jailed for Bringing Licensed, Unloaded Gun to Office\n\nArticle:\n\nA 55-year-old researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago was jailed this week for bringing a licensed, unloaded pistol to her office. The woman, who also holds an \"Illinois Firearm Owners Registration Card,\" told Chicago police that she had brought the handgun, recently purchased for home defense, to her workplace because she did not want to leave it at her residence while a work crew was there doing a renovation project.\n\nChicago has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation, and carrying a weapon, even without ammunition, is a serious offense. A co-worker spotted the pistol case and called police who came and arrested the information specialist from her workplace. The Chicago Tribune reports that the woman was held on $25,000 bond pending trial and placed on leave by the university.\n\nMeanwhile, in another part of the city, Chicago Police were dealing with a different crime. An unidentified male was found stabbed to death in an alleyway, marking the 50th murder in the city so far this year. The victim was later identified as a 22-year-old from across town in Calumet City, but given the low rate at which the city's 535 murders last year were solved, it looks unlikely that police will soon identify the one who did the stabbing.\n\nPresident Obama is currently in Chicago, making another pitch for his \"cradle to career\" educational initiatives. However, while he is in town, the president will likely have to address the murder epidemic that has gripped the city.\n\nWhile Chicago's murder rate is not as high as murder wastelands like New Orleans or Detroit, the increase in murders is alarming for locals. While murder rates in the nation continue to decline, Chicago has seen sharp increases. While murder rates in New York dropped to an all-time low last year, Chicago was approaching numbers not seen since the crack wars of the early 1990s.\n\nChicago's mayor, Rahm Emanuel, has gone to war on guns, taking up the cause with new vigor following the mass shooting in Connecticut last year. However, as the jailed University of Illinois at Chicago researcher can attest, the gun laws are already pretty strict. The police did not discover the mix-up and tell her to take her gun home; they took her to jail for having a licensed, registered weapon that without ammunition was only as deadly as a desktop stapler.\n\nEmanuel is doing everything he can to get the guns out of his city, taking up the cause with new vigor following the mass shooting in Connecticut last year. However, the question for the president is whether he can make the case that a national gun ban would be effective in reducing murder rates given the results in Chicago.\n\nChris Stirewalt, digital politics editor for \u2588\u2588\u2588, wrote in his POWER PLAY column that the $7 billion a year spent on Head Start does not make any difference after the third grade, and that Obama's proposal to double down on the program is a failure.

Trump's comments came during tense negotiations over AT&T's proposed merger with Time Warner.\n\nReports this week have been conflicting regarding whether AT&T and Time Warner are being asked to sell CNN as part of the merger to avoid monopoly regulations. CNN is part of Turner Broadcasting, which is owned by Time Warner.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) and AT&T sources initially reported that the DOJ was mandating the sale, but the Justice Department later denied these claims. AT&T was also rumored to have offered to part with CNN to secure the merger, but the company's CEO publicly stated that selling CNN is not an option.\n\nThe corporate negotiations have political implications due to Trump's frequent criticism of CNN as \"fake news.\" Some critics allege Trump may be seeking to retaliate against the network by interfering in a Justice Department decision regarding the $85 billion merger.\n\nHowever, the head of the DOJ's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, denied that the White House is involved in the transaction. \"I have never been instructed by the White House on this or any other transaction under review by the antitrust division,\" Delrahim said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"The president did not speak with the attorney general about this matter, and no White House official was authorized to speak with the Department of Justice on this matter,\" said White House spokesman Raj Shah. Trump also maintained on Saturday that he had not been involved in the decision.\n\n\"Well, I didn't make that decision \u2014 it was made by a man who's a very respected person, a very very respected person,\" Trump added. \"That probably ends up being litigation; maybe not. We'll see how it all plays out.\"\n\nTrump had previously vowed on the campaign trail last year to block the merger, stating, \"it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" The future of the merger and CNN's ownership remains uncertain.",
    " Title: IRS Pays Over $2.8 Million in Bonuses to Employees with Disciplinary Issues, Including Those Owing Back Taxes\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has paid more than $2.8 million in bonuses to employees with recent disciplinary problems, including $1 million to workers who owed back taxes, according to a report by J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration. The bonuses were awarded from October 2010 through December 2012.\n\nThe report states that the bonus program does not violate federal regulations, but it is inconsistent with the IRS's mission to enforce tax laws. The IRS has been under scrutiny for its handling of conservative groups and its high-profile targeting scandal, in which agency higher-ups allegedly exploited their power to harass and abuse organizations opposed to the government's ruling party.\n\nThe report found that more than 2,800 workers received bonuses despite facing disciplinary action in the previous year, including 1,150 who owed back taxes. The IRS has been criticized for its slow-rolling and auditing of conservative groups while bestowing generous, taxpayer-funded bonuses upon employees with disciplinary issues.\n\nMary Katharine Ham, a political commentator, expressed her disbelief, suggesting that it should be illegal for the IRS to give bonuses to employees who are responsible for collecting taxes but fail to pay their own. She questioned the common sense and the effectiveness of regulations in preventing such practices.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this public embarrassment will lead to reforms within the IRS. The agency's history of bureaucratic inertia suggests that change may be slow to come.",
    " Title: Resignation of Rep. Patrick Meehan Ends Ethics Committee Investigation, Leaves Accountability Questions Unanswered\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Patrick Meehan's immediate resignation on Friday has put an end to a pending ethics committee investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and the use of taxpayer money for a settlement. As the House Ethics Committee has no jurisdiction over lawmakers once they leave office, the investigation will be closed.\n\nMeehan, a Republican, has promised to repay the taxpayer-funded settlement, but there is no mechanism to ensure he makes good on that pledge. Stephen Spaulding, chief of strategy for Common Cause, a nonprofit group advocating for strong ethics and campaign finance requirements, stated, \"When members resign, they can evade accountability.\"\n\nThis is not the first time a Republican House member has resigned amid similar controversy. Rep. Blake Farenthold resigned on April 6, also in the face of an ethics probe after revelations of a $84,000 settlement alleging sexual harassment of a former staffer. Like Meehan, Farenthold promised to repay the $84,000 upon resigning, but has yet to do so, prompting Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to suggest Farenthold should cover the cost of a special election to fill his unexpired term.\n\nIn February, the House passed a bill requiring members of Congress to pay out of their own pockets for any sexual harassment settlements even after they leave office. The bill included a series of reforms aimed at improving the way Congress handles sexual harassment cases and came in the wake of a national wave of sexual harassment scandals. However, this measure has stalled in the Senate.\n\nSens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, are reportedly working on a compromise proposal and hope to release it in the coming weeks. The hold-up, according to Blunt, is unclear regarding the specifics of the liability provisions and when members would be personally liable.\n\nWhen asked about the negotiations, Klobuchar declined to answer specific questions, but expressed optimism about unveiling a compromise measure next month. If lawmakers do reach an agreement, it would not address the ability of lawmakers to keep ethics committee findings under wraps by resigning.\n\nJan Baran, a Washington attorney specializing in federal ethics matters, noted that some lawmakers only resign if they see \"the handwriting on the wall.\" He cited the case of ex-Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.), who faced allegations that his parents paid $96,000 to his ex-mistress and her family. Ensign was eventually penalized with a $54,000 payment in civil penalties to the Federal Election Commission to settle a parallel case.",
    " Title: Celebrities Gather to Discuss Support for Elizabeth Warren's Potential Presidential Run\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of celebrities and influencers recently gathered in a Chinatown loft to discuss their support for Senator Elizabeth Warren's potential candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. The event, dubbed \"Artists for Warren,\" was hosted by filmmakers Julie Pacino and Jennifer DeLia.\n\nAccording to Vanity Fair magazine, approximately 150 cultural tastemakers are lending their talents, connections, or names to the cause, aiming to generate enough support for Warren to challenge Hillary Clinton, the presumptive nominee, in the Democratic primary.\n\nActor Mark Ruffalo, who was set to speak at the event, shared an exclusive video message that was initially intended to be shown at the party but was not due to technical errors. In the video, Ruffalo expressed his belief that Warren, if she runs and does not win the primary, will still push the conversation towards progressive values shared by many.\n\nRuffalo, who has played a contractor in a movie about a lesbian couple and the Hulk, is known for his advocacy for progressive causes.\n\nVanity Fair is not the only media outlet expressing support for a Warren candidacy. The New York Times and David Frum of The Atlantic have also published articles advocating for Warren's populist stance.\n\nThe potential impact of a Warren candidacy on the Democratic left is a topic of discussion. Ross Baker, a political-science professor at Rutgers University, told Vanity Fair that there is a constituency on the Democratic left that has never forgiven the Clintons for welfare reform.\n\nThe exact goals and strategies of the celebrities involved in the \"Artists for Warren\" movement are not clear, as the article does not provide details about their specific plans or actions. However, the gathering in Chinatown is indicative of a growing movement among celebrities and influencers to support Warren's progressive platform.",
    " Title: Polls Show Shift in Perceptions of James Comey and Election Rigging Claims\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent poll conducted by YouGov, a broad-based research organization, has revealed a significant shift in perceptions regarding James Comey and the allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\n\nThe poll, published last week, found that numerous authorities, including former President Barack Obama, James Clapper, James Comey, and Mike Rogers, have denied the theory that Russia manipulated the vote count to elect Donald Trump. Despite this, Democrats are more likely to believe the election was rigged now than they were previously.\n\nIn the poll, respondents were asked whether it was true or false that \"Russia tampered with vote tallies in order to get Donald Trump elected President.\" The result showed that, despite numerous news developments about the relationship between Trump and Russia and no evidence of altered vote totals, Democrats are more inclined to believe the election was rigged.\n\nAnother question in the poll focused on the public's perception of James Comey following his dismissal. Despite months of harsh criticism from the left for his actions during the 2016 election, particularly his infamous letter to Congress about Emailgate, Democrats now favor Comey, 42% to 29%. Republicans, on the other hand, disfavor Comey, with 18% viewing him favorably and 57% unfavorably.\n\nThe poll also revealed a shift in Democrats' opinions of Comey, with the current favorability rating being significantly higher than it was just a month ago (17% to 36%). However, it is worth noting that the YouGov poll was conducted between May 13 and 16, before the news about Comey's memo broke, and the Harvard-Harris poll, which showed a more positive view of Comey among Democrats, was conducted between May 17 and 20.\n\nThe findings suggest that partisan tribalism may be driving perceptions of Comey and the allegations of Russian election interference.",
    " Title: Clinton Positions Entire Economic Agenda as Women's Issue in New Hampshire\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early-voting state of New Hampshire, which holds historical significance for Hillary Clinton as the first woman to win a presidential primary, the Democratic front-runner emphasized the gender aspect of her 2016 campaign during a Labor Day weekend rally. The event, titled \"Women for Hillary,\" was the first time Clinton explicitly linked her domestic and economic agenda to women's lives.\n\nAddressing a crowd of approximately 1,000 supporters outside Portsmouth Junior High School, Clinton declared, \"I'm a proud lifelong fighter for women's issues.\" She shared the stage with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a former governor and longtime supporter who officially endorsed Clinton's campaign on Saturday.\n\nClinton's speech focused on various women's issues, such as child care, paid family leave, equal pay, minimum wage, and women's health. She argued that these issues are not only women's concerns but also economic ones. For instance, Clinton stated, \"Child care is a women's issue, but it's also an economic issue... You should not have to lose your paycheck or your job when you have a baby or someone in your family gets sick.\"\n\nClinton continued to emphasize the economic implications of women's issues, stating, \"Raising the minimum wage is a women's issue... Holding corporations accountable when they gouge us on drug prices, pollute our environment or exploit workers are women's issues.\" She also included corporate profit-sharing with employees, college affordability, and creating a pathway to citizenship for immigrants as women's issues.\n\nLongtime Clinton aides noted that Clinton's open and unequivocal embrace of running as a woman and women's issues during her 2016 campaign is a departure from her 2008 presidential bid, where she shied away from explicit gender-based appeals. In her 2008 effort, Clinton often stated, \"I am not running as a woman; I am running because I believe I am the best-qualified and experienced person.\"\n\nClinton's speech in 2008, thanking her supporters for helping to put \"18 million cracks\" in the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling,\" came late in the primary, in her concession to Obama. This time around, Clinton has been attacking Republicans on women's issues and women's health, hoping that a real contrast on the issues will be what gets her over the finish line in a general election and motivates female voters.\n\nClinton singled out several Republican presidential candidates by name, including Donald Trump and Dr. Ben Carson, for their positions on women's issues and women's health. She criticized Trump for his statements on women's health issues and his opposition to abortion rights, and took a swipe at Carson for his opposition to abortion rights as well.\n\nNew Hampshire voters provided a fitting audience for Clinton's full-court woman press. In 2008, the Granite State was the first in the nation to elect a state legislature with more women than men, Clinton noted in her speech. In 2012, it was the first state to send an all-women congressional delegation to Washington. The chief justice of the Supreme Court in New Hampshire is a woman, and Shaheen made history as the first woman to be elected senator and governor from her state.\n\n\"I think the rest of America could learn a few lessons from New Hampshire, don't you?\" Clinton said. \"Republicans actually say I'm playing the gender card. Well, if calling for equal pay and paid leave and women's health is playing the gender card, deal me in.\"",
    " Title: Trump Announces Removal from Business Operations to Avoid Perceived Conflict of Interest\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference scheduled for December 15 in New York City, President Donald Trump has announced his decision to step away from his business ventures to focus solely on his presidential duties. The move is intended to eliminate any perceived conflict of interest between his business interests and his role as President.\n\nTrump, who had previously discussed the idea of placing his business in a \"blind trust\" during the GOP primary debates, has acknowledged that this would not be a true blind trust, as his children and existing Trump Organization executives would continue to manage the business.\n\nDespite this, Trump has been criticized for involving his family members in diplomatic meetings and business discussions, blurring the line between his personal and professional responsibilities. In the past, Trump has expressed confusion about the concept of a blind trust, only later stating that no such trust was necessary due to the law allowing a president to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nThe President's decision to step away from his business operations follows months of controversy and debate over his business dealings and potential conflicts of interest. Trump's announcement comes as a response to calls for transparency and the appearance of impartiality in his role as President.\n\nThe specifics of Trump's legal separation from his business have yet to be disclosed. The President has stated that the move is \"visually important\" to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest.",
    " Title: The Controversy Surrounding Confederate Statues and Symbols in America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent times, the removal of Confederate statues and symbols has been a contentious issue in America. These monuments have been vandalized, assaulted, and torn down, with authorities working to remove them. President Donald Trump has been a vocal supporter of preserving these symbols, advocating for the retention of military bases named after Confederate generals and suggesting that we should build upon our heritage rather than tearing it down.\n\nConservatives generally oppose politically correct campaigns to destroy anything that may cause offense. They fear that the eradication of Confederate symbols could lead to the destruction of other historical figures, such as George Washington. They value tradition and are concerned that we are discarding part of our history.\n\nHowever, the argument for the removal of Confederate statues and symbols is that they are an unnecessary affront to black citizens, who should not have to see defenders of chattel slavery elevated on pedestals, literally. The context in which these monuments were created must be considered, as many were erected as part of an effort to enshrine a dishonest, prettied-up version of the Confederacy.\n\nLarge statues in prominent public spaces, erected to glorify the Confederacy, should be moved to museums or battlefields. This should be done lawfully, not via mob action. The Confederate flag should be shunned, as a symbol of a viciously flawed cause. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead, such as obelisks with lists of names and Confederate cemeteries, should be preserved to mark the human cost of a terrible conflict.\n\nThe case of military bases named after Confederate generals is more complex, as these names have become part of the American military tradition. However, as the source of these names becomes more widely known, it may become increasingly difficult to ask African-American soldiers to overlook these names.\n\nThe statue of Robert E. Lee in Richmond, Virginia, which Governor Ralph Northam has announced will be removed, has long been a point of contention. Its 1890 unveiling was a significant moment in the creation of a cult of Lee as a man of \"moral strength and moral beauty.\" This portrayal was part of a Lost Cause mythology that maintained the Civil War was not primarily about slavery, but about Southern states defending their legitimate prerogatives.\n\nAlexander Stephens, the vice president of the Confederacy, would have scoffed at this. In his Cornerstone Speech in 1861, he stated that the new government was built on \"the great truth\" of slavery. The theory of states' rights used by the Confederacy to justify secession was not intended to preserve the constitutional scheme, but to dismantle it. The idea had been developed by former vice president John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, who believed the country had embarked on an erroneous, nationalist path from the beginning.\n\nThe South supported states' rights only to the extent that they were useful in protecting slavery. It insisted, after all, on a federal Fugitive Slave Act. Secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, to create a rump republic built on slavery, and to make the subsequent rise of the United States to a world power impossible. Its leaders do not deserve to be given a place of honor in our landscape, denied to worthier men. Confederate statues should not be vandalized, but they should go.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Rules President Obama's Immigration Actions Unconstitutional in Criminal Case\n\nArticle:\n\nA federal judge in Pennsylvania has ruled that President Barack Obama's recent executive actions on immigration are unconstitutional, but the decision came in a criminal case, leaving its broader impact uncertain. U.S. District Court Judge Arthur Schwab issued the first-of-its-kind ruling on Tuesday in the case of Elionardo Juarez-Escobar, a Honduran immigrant charged in federal court with unlawful re-entry after being arrested earlier this year in Pennsylvania for drunken driving.\n\nIn a 38-page opinion, Schwab stated that Obama's unilateral legislative action violates the separation of powers provided for in the United States Constitution as well as the Take Care Clause. The judge argued that Obama's November 20, 2014 Executive Action goes beyond prosecutorial discretion because it provides for a systematic and rigid process by which a broad group of individuals will be treated differently than others based upon arbitrary classifications, rather than case-by-case examination. The judge also noted that the actions allow undocumented immigrants, who fall within these broad categories, to obtain substantive rights.\n\nSchwab rejected a Justice Department legal opinion arguing that Obama's actions fall within the traditional realm of the executive's discretion about which cases to pursue and which to overlook. The judge also quoted in detail from a series of public statements Obama made in recent years about the limits on his executive authority to make sweeping changes in immigration enforcement.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman rejected the judge's legal rationale and his decision to opine on the legality of Obama's actions. \"The decision is unfounded and the court had no basis to issue such an order,\" said the official, who asked not to be named. \"No party in the case challenged the constitutionality of the immigration-related executive actions and the department\u2019s filing made it clear that the executive actions did not apply to the criminal matter before the court.\"\n\nAnother administration official, who also asked not to be named, added: \"The judge's ruling has absolutely no effect on the president's executive actions. The judge has not been asked to rule on them, and the judge's order does not affect them. [The Department of Homeland Security] continues to prepare to implement the executive actions.\"\n\nIn a court filing earlier this month, prosecutors argued that Obama's decision to defer deportation of many immigrants did not limit criminal cases like the one against Juarez-Escobar. \"This policy...relates only to civil immigration enforcement status; it...has no effect on criminal prosecutions,\" prosecutors wrote in their filing. \"Modification of DHS policy to prioritize particular classes of unauthorized aliens in order to allocate resources for civil immigration enforcement does not limit the Department of Justice\u2019s prosecutorial decision on the criminal referral in this case.\"\n\nLawsuits challenging Obama's policies in a more direct way are pending in Washington, D.C., and Brownsville, Texas. A hearing on a request to block the presidential actions is scheduled for next week in the D.C. case, brought by Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio. In the Texas case, a total of 24 states are challenging the legality of Obama's immigration moves.\n\nWhile those cases have at least the theoretical possibility to halt Obama's actions, the Pennsylvania case\u2014as a criminal proceeding involving a single individual\u2014does not seem to have that potential. However, Schwab's ruling could have some impact, especially since lawyers handling the lawsuits pending in D.C. and Texas filed Schwab's opinion with the judges on those cases late Tuesday.\n\nSince Schwab is a Bush appointee, it will be tempting for many immigrant rights advocates to view his opinion as a political swipe at Obama. Indeed, many of the judge's arguments parallel those being put forward by Republican critics of the president's immigration actions. However, the judge's opinion raises a question that some advocates of more liberal immigration policies will not be able to dismiss so easily: why do not Obama's actions apply to criminal prosecutions as well as deportations? Indeed, what is the point of protecting immigrants from being expelled from the country if they can still be sent to prison for having illegally entered the country in the first place?\n\nSchwab wrote in his ruling Tuesday that he's open to Juarez-Escobar withdrawing a guilty plea he offered in October, less than a month before Obama announced plans to allow family members of U.S. citizens to stay in the U.S for up to three years and obtain work permits. Schwab's opinion appears to have been first reported by the Volokh Conspiracy blog.\n\nUPDATE (Tuesday, 8:47 p.m.): This post has been updated with reactions from administration officials.\n\nUPDATE 2 (Wednesday, 8:38 a.m.): This post has been upated with the filing of Schwab's opinion in the pending lawsuits.",
    " Title: Trump's Unconventional Approach Yields Significant Achievements in First Year\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who took office in 2017, faced a wave of negativity and skepticism, with some predicting he would not complete his first year in office or pass major legislation. However, the Pew Research Center reported that 62 percent of news stories about Trump's first 60 days were negative, compared to 20 percent for President Obama and 28 percent for Bush and Clinton.\n\nDespite the negative media coverage, Trump's actions have been pleasing his supporters. The economy is experiencing growth not seen in years, the most significant tax reform since 1986 has been passed, and deregulation efforts are underway. The number of pages in the Federal Register, where new regulations are published, is now two-thirds of where it stood during the Obama administration.\n\nTrump has made a lasting impact on the nation through his conservative judicial appointments. Twelve of his federal appeals court judge nominations have been confirmed by the Senate, and Neil Gorsuch has taken the seat of the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. With two Supreme Court justices over 80, there is a possibility that Trump will have the opportunity to appoint another conservative justice during his first term.\n\nReports indicate that Trump will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan at Camp David to discuss legislative plans for 2018. Major campaign issues still on the table include immigration reform, welfare reform, and national infrastructure investments. The outcome of these deliberations is expected to reflect a combination of idealism and political realism.\n\nThe Senate's Republican margin has narrowed to 51 to 49, increasing the challenge for McConnell. However, Trump's unconventional approach to politics has been marked by a willingness to push through his campaign promises, such as recognizing Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel.\n\nImmigration reform and welfare reform are two issues of critical importance, both with significant impacts on the nation and both politically challenging. The inability of Washington to address these issues was a driving factor for many voters to support Trump. If Trump fails to address these issues, he risks becoming just another politician.\n\nIn conclusion, it is expected that 2018 will bring more unexpected accomplishments from Trump as he continues to carry forward his campaign promises. Trump's inaugural address encapsulated his vision for the country: \"And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit, or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their hearts with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.\"",
    " Title: U.S. and European Economic Measures Boost Stocks to Best Day of 2012\n\nArticle:\n\nStocks in the U.S. and Europe surged on Wednesday, marking their best day of the year, following speculation that governments in both regions may take action to support their economies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 286.84 points to close at 12,414.79, its biggest gain since December 20.\n\nAtlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart, in a speech, highlighted the \"halting and tenuous\" recovery, suggesting that further monetary actions may be necessary if the current weak job growth trend continues. Meanwhile, news reports indicated that German and European Union officials were considering a plan to lend money from the European bailout fund to help rescue Spain's struggling banks.\n\nIn the ordinary stock market, such developments would likely not cause a significant impact. However, the market has been anything but ordinary lately, posting decline after decline amid the financial crisis in Europe and the slowing U.S. economy. Traders are now hanging on to rumors and speculation, according to Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 rose 29.63 points to 1,315.13, and the Nasdaq composite rose 66.61 points to 2,844.72. Companies whose stocks have been hardest hit over the past month experienced the best gains. Homebuilders rallied, helped by a strong earnings report from Hovnanian Enterprises and rising applications for new mortgages.\n\nHovnanian's CEO stated that he sees signs that the housing industry may be entering the early stages of recovery. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that applications for mortgages rose 1.3 percent last week, largely due to more people trying to refinance their existing loans.\n\nThe gains were widespread, with only 11 companies in the S&P 500 dropping, and every industry group in the index rising, led by energy and financial companies. Roughly seven stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nJim Russell, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Cincinnati, Ohio, said it's natural for the market to have a strong day after an extended period of decline. He described it as a \"technical bounce,\" stating, \"There's no bad news today, so the market goes up. Frankly, it's that simple.\"\n\nU.S. markets followed major European indexes higher, with indexes rising 2.4 percent in the U.K. and France. Borrowing costs eased for Spain, another positive sign. A Federal Reserve survey showed growth across the country, with hiring steady, according to the Fed's \"Beige Book.\" This contrasts with the government's monthly jobs report, which stated that employers added the fewest jobs in a year last month.\n\nThe dollar dipped, and Treasury yields rose as investors moved money out of defensive investments. The yield on the benchmark rose to 1.64 percent from 1.57 percent late Tuesday.\n\nOther significant movers included Morgan Stanley, which jumped $1.08, 8 percent, to $13.94 amid reports that the Blackstone Group and other private equity firms may try to buy a stake in the bank's commodities business. UnitedHealth Group gained $1.66, 3 percent, to $57.70 after the health insurer said it will raise its quarterly dividend from 16 cents to 21 cents per share and approved a plan to buy back stock.\n\nTempur-Pedic International plunged $21.28, 49 percent, to $22.39, as the mattress maker expects quarterly profits to fall by half compared to last year. Tempur-Pedic blamed its competitors' aggressive marketing campaigns and promotions for hurting its sales.",
    " Title: Clinton and Sanders Face Off in New Hampshire Debate Ahead of Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the New Hampshire primary, Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders faced off in a debate on Thursday, marking their only meeting before the Granite State primary. This encounter offers some insights into the candidates' strategies and positions.\n\nEight years ago, Hillary Clinton found herself in a tight spot in New Hampshire, facing a significant loss to Barack Obama. This time around, despite a 40-point lead in New Hampshire last summer, Clinton is currently in a dead heat with Sanders, according to a post-Iowa NBC News/Marist poll. Sanders, however, is not Obama in terms of organizational skills or the ability to build a majority coalition among Democratic voters.\n\nOne question that arises is why Clinton struggles to connect with voters on a personal level. As the Clinton team considers their post-New Hampshire strategy, they might want to consult the past campaigns of Mitt Romney, John McCain, and Bob Dole, all of whom made tactical errors by adopting more ideological personas that resonated poorly with their party's grassroots activists.\n\nIn the debate, Clinton was intense and focused on highlighting Sanders' 18 trillion dollar wish list of expansive government programs as unrealistic. While she is correct, her approach may not be the most effective way to appeal to Democratic voters, who typically respond well to personality and passion. Successful Democratic presidential candidates have historically run as optimists, not scolds.\n\nSanders, on the other hand, missed an opportunity to address Clinton's Goldman Sachs honoraria during the debate, despite an ad attacking Goldman Sachs' economic impact. Clinton, in turn, did not mention Sanders' son-in-law, who is a hedge-fund manager. The Clinton family's financial dealings, including speaking fees and other income sources, have been a point of contention and may pose a challenge in the general election.\n\nBill Clinton went largely unmentioned during the 90-minute debate, and there was no discussion of Donald Trump. MSNBC, the debate's host, missed opportunities to press Sanders on his endorsement plans should Clinton prevail and to address the possibility of Clinton selecting Sanders as a running mate.\n\nAs the two candidates debate their progressive credentials, the irony is palpable: either Clinton or Sanders will emerge victorious in this Democratic battle. Gallup's analysis shows that 20 U.S. states are \"red\" (solidly or leaning Republican) versus only 14 \"blue\" Democratic states, a significant shift from 2009 when Gallup painted 33 states blue and only five red. The debate's focus on progressive ideals underscores this shift in political landscape.",
    " Title: Trump Admits Son's Meeting with Russian Lawyer was to Obtain Information on Opponent\n\nArticle:\n\nUS President Donald Trump has admitted that his son, Donald Trump Jr, met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016 to obtain information on an opponent. The meeting, which took place at Trump Tower, is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into Russia's alleged role in helping Mr. Trump win the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, Mr. Trump called the ongoing investigations in the US \"the greatest political witch hunt in history.\" Russia has repeatedly denied claims it interfered in the November 2016 presidential elections, where Mr. Trump defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn Monday, the president quoted a Fox and Friends interview about alleged Democratic collusion with Russia. Mr. Trump has spoken out before about links between Moscow and Mrs. Clinton while saying it is \"commonly agreed\" that there was no collusion between Russia and him.\n\nMr. Trump's Sunday tweet appears to contradict a previous statement from the Trump camp about the meeting. When the meeting was first reported by the New York Times, Donald Trump Jr said in a statement that he and Ms. Veselnitskaya had mostly discussed a suspended program for Americans to adopt Russian children. However, he subsequently admitted he had agreed to the meeting after being told he would be offered information that would prove detrimental to Mrs. Clinton. He also released the email exchange that brought about the meeting.\n\nUS media then reported that the US president had been involved in the initial statement his son issued on the meeting. This was initially denied by Mr. Trump's team, but his lawyers later confirmed that he had in fact dictated his son's statement.\n\nUS commentators have argued that Mr. Trump's new admission that the meeting was to gain information about Mrs. Clinton shows that the earlier statement was misleading. Mr. Trump again denied knowing about the meeting in Sunday's tweet.\n\nThe special counsel is currently investigating whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice. Under US law, obstruction cases require proving \"corrupt intent\" - so while Mr. Trump's tweet does not prove anything illegal, it could serve as evidence of the president's intent.\n\nIt is common for US politicians to research their opponents during a campaign. However, legal experts say that Mr. Trump Jr could fall foul of campaign finance laws, which prohibit accepting anything of value from a foreign government or foreign national. Mr. Trump Jr's apparently enthusiastic response to the offer of information about Mrs. Clinton could also breach conspiracy laws.\n\nThe Trump team has argued that Mr. Trump Jr ultimately did not receive any damaging information about Mrs. Clinton at the meeting. Some analysts say that by having the meeting at all, Mr. Trump Jr broke the law. But others say it is unclear as no information reportedly exchanged hands at the meeting.\n\nOne of Mr. Trump's lawyers, Jay Sekulow, said on Sunday that the meeting had not broken any laws. \"The question is what law, statute or regulation's been violated?

If Trump's campaign rhetoric is to be taken at face value, the global landscape could become more dangerous for America's allies.\n\nSince the end of World War II, a network of US-focused military alliances has underpinned global peace and security. Trump has questioned the value of these alliances, suggesting that America does not need them or that Washington should charge more for them. He has also referred to NATO, the bedrock of trans-Atlantic security, as \"obsolete.\"\n\nTrump's comments have raised concerns about the future of NATO, particularly in light of his perceived leniency towards Russian President Vladimir Putin and his apparent indifference towards NATO's collective defense structure. While most Western intelligence agencies warn that Putin's goal is to divide the West and undermine NATO, Trump seems less suspicious and less solicitous of that structure.\n\nIn Europe, Trump's election has sparked concerns about the future of the NATO alliance, with some members, such as the Baltic states, especially nervous about Moscow's intentions. In Asia, Trump's strategic intentions are also unclear, with some signs suggesting that he may be ready to abandon key allies like Japan and South Korea to their fate.\n\nIn Japan, Trump's election has raised concerns about the future of the security alliance, with the President-elect having said that unless Tokyo paid more for its defense, it should go it alone and perhaps build a nuclear weapon to protect itself. In South Korea, Trump's election has also caused uncertainty, with the President-elect having threatened to pull American forces out of the country unless Seoul pays more for their upkeep.\n\nIn Australia, one of America's most distant but most loyal allies, Trump's ascension has sparked unprecedented doubts about the future of a defense partnership with the United States that has undergirded the country's peace and prosperity since the end of World War II. With the signing of the ANZUS Treaty in 1951, Washington guaranteed Australia's security as it developed into one of the richest societies on earth. In return, Australian troops have fought alongside American forces in every war that Washington has fought.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding Trump's foreign policy has left many allies questioning the future of their security arrangements with the United States. As Trump takes office, the world watches with bated breath to see how he will navigate the complex web of alliances that have underpinned global peace and security since the end of World War II.",
    " Title: Georgia Secretary of State Investigates Minority Voter Registration Drive, Pastor Raphael Warnock Accuses of Voter Suppression\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange, Pastor Raphael Warnock, the pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, has accused Georgia's Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, of voter suppression in connection with an ongoing investigation into a minority voter registration drive. The investigation, led by Kemp's office, is examining the New Georgia Project, an organization associated with Warnock, for potential fraud in its efforts to register over 100,000 minority voters before the October 6 deadline.\n\nAt a press conference in Georgia's Capitol building, Warnock stated, \"You don't have to wear a hood -- you don't have to be a member of the Ku Klux Klan to be engaged in voter suppression. We know voter suppression when we see it.\"\n\nKemp's office has confirmed 28 cases of fraud in 14 counties, including 25 fraudulent voter registration applications and three fraudulent canvassing sheets. Some applications contained forged signatures, while others had false information. An additional 26 cases were labeled as suspicious. Falsifying a voter registration form is a felony in the state of Georgia.\n\nKemp told Fox News, \"Any time that you're talking about forgery and fraud in Georgia law, it's certainly very serious.\"\n\nThe controversy arises in the context of the narrow margins in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.). Polls show Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn trailing Republican David Perdue. Nunn's campaign believes that if it makes significant inroads into signing up some of the 800,000 unregistered minority voters in Georgia, she could take the seat.\n\nThe New Georgia Project was founded by Georgia House Minority Leader Rep. Stacey Abrams, who is a member of Nunn's advisory team. Abrams maintains a clear separation between her work with the Nunn campaign and the New Georgia Project, which she describes as a \"nonpartisan\" effort to increase minority voter turnout in November.\n\nKemp has issued a subpoena to the New Georgia Project, demanding all documents and communications related to the voter registration drive by next Friday. The New Georgia Project has responded, proclaiming its innocence and stating that it is strictly following the law. Abrams argues that the subpoena is \"overly burdensome and an abuse of power,\" taking valuable time away from the group's voter registration drive.\n\nAt the press conference, Abrams accused Kemp of a pattern of voter suppression and intimidation. The New Georgia Project claims that of the 85,000 new voters they have signed up, 51,000 have not yet been registered. Kemp insists that any valid voter registration forms will be processed by the appropriate county officials and that his office is not blocking the registration of minority voters.\n\nKemp told Fox News, \"I was very disappointed in a lot of the reverend's comments.\" He added, \"I think anybody that knows me knows that I'm not a racist and some of the things that they've said and accused me of are just flat wrong.\"\n\nNew Georgia Project officials claim the words \"fraud,\" \"forgery,\" and \"felony\" have a chilling effect on any other organizations who might want to sign up new voters.\n\nWarnock demanded at the press conference, \"Mr. Secretary of State, stop this dog and pony show with all of the subpoenas -- with all of the false accusations and the smear campaign, and do your job.\"\n\nKemp insists his job is to investigate any reports of fraud and forgery brought to his attention by several counties, stating that it is simply his duty to investigate them. He told Fox News that with what is at stake in November, it's not a surprise the matter has become so politicized.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that it's gotten political,\" Kemp said, \"but we're in the silly season, if you will, right now, and have some big races in Georgia.\"",
    " Title: DNC Chairman Urges States to Proceed with Primaries Amid COVID-19 Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez has encouraged states to hold their scheduled presidential primaries despite federal guidance advising against large gatherings due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. On Tuesday, Florida, Illinois, and Arizona conducted their primaries as planned, while Ohio, Georgia, Kentucky, and Louisiana postponed their primaries to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nPerez commended the states that held their elections, acknowledging the risks associated with people gathering and voting. In an interview with NPR, Perez stated, \"I think it's a false choice to suggest we either have to protect safety or protect and ensure our democracy. What you saw in Arizona today, and in Florida, was in Arizona more people voted early than voted in the entirety of the Democratic primary in 2016.\"\n\nAccording to NPR, Arizona Democratic Party officials reported a surge in turnout due to early mail-in voting, a practice Perez is advocating for other states to adopt. He added, \"I've called on all the states that haven't gone yet to take these steps so that we can in fact have voting and protect our workers, our voters, our candidates.\"\n\nCBS News reported that some polling places experienced long lines and confusion on Tuesday, with many poll workers staying home to avoid health risks. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine (R) opted to postpone his state's primary to June, defying a judge's decision, as COVID-19 cases continued to rise. DeWine explained during a press conference, \"We should not force [voters and poll workers] to make this choice. A choice between their health and their Constitutional rights and their duties.\"\n\nThe two Democratic front-runners, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), chose to engage with voters online rather than campaigning in person in Florida, Illinois, and Arizona on Tuesday. Biden emerged victorious in all three states. The Washington Post noted that both candidates did not campaign in person due to the ongoing pandemic.",
    " Title: Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl Faces Desertion and Misbehavior Charges Under Uniform Code of Military Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nArmy Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was released last summer in a prisoner swap involving five top Taliban commanders, has been charged with desertion and misbehavior in front of the enemy under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. If convicted, he faces life in prison.\n\nBergdahl's legal defense team will argue in military court that Bergdahl did not desert but was attempting to reach another base to report wrongdoing within his Army unit. The Obama administration has previously defended the decision to secure Bergdahl's release, stating he served with \"honor and distinction.\"\n\nHowever, a report from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) indicates that Bergdahl not only deserted his unit but deliberately sought out the Taliban and other enemies of the United States. It is worth noting that many of Bergdahl's platoon members have claimed this since the beginning, but were discredited by the Obama administration as unreliable and liars for doing so.\n\nA 2009 NCIS investigation into Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's activities in Afghanistan revealed clear evidence that Bergdahl was intentionally defecting to the enemy, according to Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer on Fox News' \"The O'Reilly Factor\" Monday night.\n\n\"He had Afghan contacts and he was actually trying to offer himself up with the Taliban,\" Shaffer said. \"Both are very severe.\"\n\nShaffer added that the NCIS investigation, which included interviews with squad mates as well as Afghans working outside the wire, reportedly resulted in Bergdahl being charged with misbehavior toward the enemy.\n\nLt. Col. Shaffer also noted during the interview that President Obama would have been aware of Bergdahl's desertion through the NCIS before making the decision to negotiate his release.\n\nA preliminary Article 32 hearing has been scheduled for Bergdahl's case and will be held at Ft. Sam Houston, Texas. The exact date of the hearing has yet to be announced.",
    " Title: Senate Faces Pressure to Vote on Keystone XL Pipeline Amidst Tight Election Cycle\n\nArticle:\n\nWith several Democratic senators facing tight re-elections in November, Majority Leader Harry Reid is under pressure to bring the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline to a vote in the Senate. Reid has expressed a preference for a non-binding \"sense of the Senate\" resolution, which would express support for the pipeline without binding legislative action. However, some Republicans and Democrats are pushing for a more substantial bill to approve the pipeline.\n\nA bipartisan bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline was introduced on Thursday, and Reid has yet to indicate his position on the matter, with a vote potentially imminent. In response to the pressure, Reid stated, \"Originally, it was supposed to be a sense of the Senate. Now they said they want it an up or down on a piece of legislation. They can't decide what it is.\"\n\nReid's comments refer to a bipartisan energy efficiency bill in the Senate, sponsored by New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman, which is set for debate and a vote next week. Some lawmakers are seeking to include the Keystone XL pipeline in this debate.\n\nSouth Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune stated, \"In that debate, we ought to have a binding vote on the Keystone pipeline that would force that issue to the American people.\"\n\nThe Obama administration has delayed making a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline multiple times, putting pressure on Reid from both the left and right flanks of the political spectrum. Among the at-risk 2014 Democrats is Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, who has expressed frustration with the White House and Reid over the prolonged study of the pipeline.\n\nLandrieu, who co-sponsored the latest bill, stated, \"The Keystone Pipeline is clearly in our national interest and vital to position North America as an energy powerhouse. I will press hard for a vote in the coming weeks to build this pipeline.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney warned lawmakers, \"What we've seen in the past when Congress has passed legislation, it has actually slowed the process down. So we believe this has to be run by the book outside of politics, and that's the way it's being run.\"\n\nCritics question whether the Keystone XL pipeline is truly beyond politics at this stage. The Senate has already expressed support for the pipeline, passing a nonbinding resolution to approve the project during the Senate budget process in March 2013, in a 62-37 vote. Over in the Republican-controlled House, there remains strong support for building the project.\n\nGeorgia Rep. John Barrow, a Democrat who is a vocal critic of the Obama administration on this issue, stated, \"Further delays in constructing this pipeline mean that the U.S. will miss out on tens of thousands of jobs and continue to depend on foreign oil from hostile countries.\"\n\nBarrow argued, \"The Keystone XL Pipeline will bring in 840,000 barrels of oil per day from our friend and neighbor, Canada. That could essentially replace the 900,000 barrels we have to get every day from Venezuela - one country we can not count on.\"\n\nBarrow questions who will be the first to use the oil if the pipeline is not built. \"The oil will be extracted, refined, and used by someone. My question: who will be first in line to use it?\"\n\nCapitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Capitol Hill team.

    " Title: Clinton Email Scandal Threatens Presidential Ambitions, According to Analysts\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton is facing mounting criticism over allegations that she sent top-secret information from a non-secure email account while serving as Secretary of State. The intelligence community's inspector general stated in a letter to Congress this week that some of Clinton's messages contained information classified above \"top secret.\"\n\nAccording to Fox News, the information is so sensitive that even senators, who already have clearance, must go through additional security measures to view some of the information Clinton was sending. The Clinton campaign has accused the inspector general, I. Charles McCullough, of politically motivated leaks intended to sabotage her campaign.\n\nHowever, the email scandal appears to have already taken a toll on Clinton's image. Surveys show that voters view her primary challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders, as more honest and trustworthy.\n\nBrandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston who specializes in political leadership, stated, \"Trustworthiness is not a problem by itself for Clinton, but combined with other past and present scandals weighing her down, alternative candidates like Sanders begin to look more appealing.\"\n\nA recent Quinnipiac University Poll found that 93 percent of Democratic primary voters consider Sanders honest and trustworthy, while just 66 percent said the same of Clinton. A CNN survey conducted this month found that 55 percent of Democratic voters consider Clinton to be the \"least honest\" candidate in the race.\n\nReports surfaced this week that Clinton's private email server contained several dozen more classified emails than previously thought, including some from \"special access programs,\" or SAP. Even top members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations are unable to view such messages without additional security steps, including signing new nondisclosure agreements, according to Fox News.\n\n\"These declarations cover several dozen emails containing classified information determined to be at the confidential, secret, and top secret/sap levels,\" Mr. McCullough said in a letter to lawmakers obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nClinton pushed back against the reports in an interview with NPR, maintaining that she never knowingly sent or received classified email on her private server. \"As the State Department has confirmed, I never sent or received any material marked classified, and that hasn't changed in all of these months,\" she said.\n\nClinton's campaign argued that the emails appear to have been forwards of a New York Times article on a classified drone program, and say the messages seem to have been retroactively classified.\n\n\"How a New York Times public article that goes around the world could be in any way viewed as classified, or the fact that it would be sent to other people off of The New York Times site, I think, is one of the difficulties that people have in understanding what this is about,\" Clinton told NPR.\n\nThe State Department is under a court order to produce about 55,000 emails from Clinton's home server. Most have been released, with the last of them expected on Jan. 29\u2014just days before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.\n\nClinton's use of private email has been a source of controversy since it was first revealed publicly in March 2015. She began returning her emails to the State Department after the Obama administration, prodded by a House investigation into the Benghazi affair, discovered that Clinton had taken all of her messages with her when she left the State Department at the end of President Obama's first term.\n\nThe administration then said that Clinton had refused to use a regular email account on the State.gov email server and instead used a private server that she kept in her home in New York. Clinton has since said she regrets using the private server, but has steadfastly maintained that she did not use the private account to send or receive classified information.\n\nInvestigations have also found that the State Department has struggled to fulfill open records requests for Clinton's emails. As of Jan. 7, 177 requests for documents from Clinton were still pending, according to the State Department inspector general.\n\nSpecialists suggest that voters on the fence in the Democratic primary election may take the email scandal\u2014and the larger questions about Clinton's honesty\u2014into account when choosing a candidate.\n\n\"The problem for Hillary Clinton is that there are alternatives to her candidacy in Bernie Sanders. This is why polls of Democrats don't think Sanders can win [the general election] but are willing to vote for him anyway,\" Mr. Rottinghaus said.",
    " Title: Kerry Walks Back \"Apartheid\" Comment Regarding Israel, Denies Using Loaded Term\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent report by The Daily Beast, it was reported that Secretary of State John Kerry stated that if Israel does not reach a two-state agreement with the Palestinians, it risks becoming an \"apartheid state.\" Kerry's comments, made in a closed-door meeting with influential world leaders on Friday, have sparked controversy, particularly among Jewish leaders in America.\n\nIn a statement released by the State Department on Saturday, Kerry denied using the term \"apartheid\" and stated that he should have chosen different words to describe his belief in the need for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Kerry also expressed his unwavering support for Israel and criticized those who question his commitment to the Jewish state.\n\nIn the same statement, Kerry clarified that he does not believe Israel is an apartheid state or intends to become one. He also stated that his use of the term \"apartheid\" was unintentional and that he regretted any misimpression created by his choice of words.\n\nThe use of the term \"apartheid\" is significant, as it is a loaded term that has rarely, if ever, been used by senior American officials in reference to Israel. President Obama has previously rejected the idea that the term should apply to Israel.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Kerry's comments comes at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a contentious issue. In a separate development, the 2012 Democratic National Convention refused to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a move that has been criticized by some Jewish leaders. The Orthodox Union, an American Jewish organization, has expressed disappointment over the omission of Jerusalem from the 2012 DNC platform, stating that \"facts are facts; Jerusalem is Israel's capital.\"",
    " Title: Obama Pushes Executive Action on Gun Control as GOP Presidential Candidates Vow to Reverse Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shift from his earlier skepticism of aggressive executive power, President Barack Obama is now employing executive action on gun control, with new measures to be announced this week. The new actions include tightening the so-called \"gun-show loophole\" by requiring occasional gun dealers to obtain licenses and conduct background checks on buyers.\n\nThe administration also plans to boost enforcement of federal gun laws, including the hiring of additional FBI personnel to process background checks. Some of the new gun measures require congressional approval, but those enacted by executive order have the force of law and can be undone by the next president.\n\nIf a Republican wins the 2016 presidential election, they are likely to reverse many of Obama's executive actions, not just on gun control but also on issues like immigration and women's reproductive health. The large Republican presidential field has uniformly criticized Obama's use of executive power.\n\nFront-runner Donald Trump has vowed to \"unsign\" any gun control measures Obama enacts unilaterally, while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have criticized Obama's actions on guns. However, the reality is that the next president, regardless of party affiliation, is likely to follow Obama's lead on the use of executive authority.\n\nIf the Republicans sweep the 2016 elections, winning the White House and keeping control of both houses of Congress, the Democrats will still be able to block legislation they don't like through the filibuster. Even if a Democrat wins the presidency, Republicans are still likely to keep the House, if not the Senate, leaving Washington as gridlocked as ever.\n\nObama has shown a willingness to use executive action on divisive topics like immigration and gun control, even after saying he's done everything he can. The best example is immigration, where Obama has deferred deportation for young illegal immigrants and undocumented parents of US citizens and legal permanent residents. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has pledged to go even further on immigration via executive action if elected.\n\nOn gun control, Obama tried a two-track approach after the Sandy Hook massacre, with executive action and legislation. The effort in Congress was less fruitful, as a bipartisan bill to expand background checks on gun buyers and ban assault weapons failed.\n\nObama has made clear that in his remaining time as president, keeping guns out of the \"wrong hands\" is a top priority. Though most of the recent, high-profile gun incidents have involved weapons that were legally obtained, Obama seems undeterred. Polls show expanded background checks have strong public support, though in the wake of San Bernardino, a majority of Americans now oppose a ban on assault weapons.",
    " Title: \"CNN Pieces Together Disturbing Past of Florida School Shooter Nikolas Cruz\"\n\nArticle:\n\nCNN has pieced together a disturbing portrait of Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old Broward County man who carried out the nation's most recent mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The shooting resulted in the deaths of 17 people and left another 17 injured.\n\nAccording to an acquaintance interviewed by CNN, Cruz would introduce himself as \"Nick, I'm a school shooter.\" He also posed with guns and knives in photos posted on Instagram and made a chilling online comment about a mass shooting carried out in New York this summer.\n\nCruz's attorneys have referred to his chronic battle with mental illness and depression, which they attribute to the recent death of his adoptive mother, leaving him without parents. A defense attorney described him as \"a broken child.\"\n\nCruz was adopted at a young age by Roger and Lynda Cruz. Roger died years ago, and Lynda died last fall, following an illness. He was taken in by the parents of a schoolmate, according to that family's attorney.\n\nHis mother's death capped troubled high school years that ended with his expulsion from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. A former classmate, who grew up with Cruz and attended school with him since the sixth grade, said Cruz would sometimes introduce himself as a \"school shooter.\"\n\nAnother neighbor, concerned about Cruz \"acting weird\" in the backyard, took video of him dressed in boxer shorts shooting what appeared to be a BB gun. He sometimes pointed the gun toward their window, the man said.\n\nCruz had two Instagram accounts featuring weapons and photos. In one picture, he is wearing a kerchief over his face and a Make America Great Again hat. Another photo is taken from behind a gun sight looking out the window.\n\nThe FBI received a report of a comment made by a user with Cruz's name attached to it, in response to a story about a disgruntled doctor in New York who used an AR-15 to shoot seven people, killing one and wounding six others. However, FBI officials were unable to determine who was responsible.\n\nNot everyone who crossed paths with Cruz saw reason for concern. The attorney for the family who took him in after his mother's death said they were aware of trouble he'd earlier had at school and saw signs of depression. But, \"they did not see any danger,\" Jim Lewis said of the unidentified family.\n\nAccording to authorities, Cruz was initially able to leave the crime scene at the school by blending in with students fleeing campus in the wake of the massacre. He went to a Walmart and a McDonald's before being found by police and taken into custody. He has since confessed to the killings, according to court documents.\n\nGordon Weekes, one of Cruz's public defenders, said he believed Cruz has been placed on suicide watch. He said the defense team would be exploring mental health issues and \"the possibility of autism.\"\n\n\"We are trying to save this young man's life,\" Weekes said.",
    " Title: The Rise of a Scientific Revolution in Conservative Politics: A Call for Objective Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a passionate speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, Democratic pollster Pat Caddell accused Republican consultants of widespread corruption, sparking a wave of grassroots outrage. Rush Limbaugh further fueled the fire, criticizing establishment players for their ideological softness and perceived focus on approval from the D.C. elite and financial gain rather than political victory.\n\nThese accusations are part of a growing chorus of criticism directed at the performance of the Romney campaign, the Republican Party, and conservative organizations. Critics argue that the Romney campaign's polling, messaging, strategy, tactics, and targeting were all failures. They suggest that these failures, if so obvious and complete, indicate not just incompetence but malfeasance on the part of those in charge.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to avoid turning this self-examination into a witch-hunt, as some might be quick to condemn the very people who would be praised had an outside event intervened to elect a President Romney. The need now is for a means of distinguishing between effective and ineffective strategies, a strength that Democrats have leveraged through their alliance with academic social scientists.\n\nFor over a decade, liberal interest groups have collaborated with social scientists to study politics using the scientific method, deploying randomized, controlled experiments to rigorously test the effectiveness of their messages and tactics. This approach has allowed Democrats to build an objective base of knowledge on what works and what doesn't. Today, the Left is characterized by a culture of testing, with expert opinions treated as hypotheses to be tested with experiments.\n\nFor instance, the Obama campaign heavily invested in grassroots field offices, a decision supported by years of randomized-controlled experiments indicating that these offices, despite their expense and difficulty, yield the highest vote return. The Obama campaign also promoted strategies such as strange video pledges to support the president or \"voter report cards\" informing Democrats of their voting record and how it compared with their neighbors, tactics that experiments indicated are effective at getting out the vote.\n\nIn light of these findings, it is clear that a more scientific approach to political strategy could benefit the Republican Party and conservative organizations. By embracing the core of the scientific method, they can objectively determine what works and what doesn't, and ultimately, improve their chances of political victory.",
    " Title: Russian Cyberattacks on U.S. Government Agencies Unveiled\n\nArticle:\n\nFor years, Russian cyber activities have remained relatively low-profile compared to Chinese cyber espionage, which has been frequently exposed. However, Russian hackers have been stealthily infiltrating U.S. systems, stealing sensitive information such as the designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets, and blueprints for gas pipelines. During the 2008 presidential election cycle, Chinese intelligence reportedly hacked into the campaigns of Barack Obama and John McCain, but did not publish the stolen data.\n\nKevin Mandia, a former Air Force intelligence officer and founder of cybersecurity firm Mandiant (now a division of FireEye), noted that the Russians were \"a lot more stealthy.\" They have been quicker to use cyberattacks for political purposes, as demonstrated by the 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO, and subsequent cyberattacks during Russia's war with Georgia.\n\nDespite initial assumptions, American officials did not anticipate that the Russians would employ such tactics within the United States. Their primary focus was on preventing potential disruptions to critical infrastructure, such as the power grid or cellphone networks, as warned by former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta about a potential \"cyber Pearl Harbor.\"\n\nHowever, in 2014 and 2015, a Russian hacking group began systematically targeting the State Department, the White House, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. According to Michael Sulmeyer, a former cyberexpert for the secretary of defense, and Ben Buchanan, now both of the Harvard Cyber Security Project, the Russians \"eventually met with some form of success\" in these attacks.\n\nThe Russian hackers became increasingly stealthy, tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic \"command and control\" messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so severely affected that it repeatedly shut down its systems to evict the intruders. During Secretary of State John Kerry's trip to Vienna for the Iran nuclear negotiations, officials and accompanying reporters had to use commercial Gmail accounts to communicate due to the State Department's crippled systems.\n\nPresident Obama was briefed on these attacks, but chose not to publicly name the Russians or impose sanctions. This decision, which is now regretted by many in the White House, was reportedly due to fears of escalating a cyberwar and the need for Russia's cooperation in Syria-related negotiations.",
    " Title: GOP Debate Highlights: Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Lindsey Graham Shine in Las Vegas\n\nArticle:\n\nThe fifth Republican presidential debate on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, Nevada, was marked by the impact of the Paris and San Bernardino attacks, with a significant focus on terrorism. The following is a summary of the standout performances from the main and undercard debates.\n\nIn the main debate, Florida Senator Marco Rubio demonstrated consistency throughout the early election season, conveying clear convictions, a common-sense-sounding policy framework, and an optimistic outlook. He displayed confidence without resorting to the braggadocio of Donald Trump, showcasing a likeability that stems from his personal story and avoiding the Senate speak that affected other candidates on stage.\n\nTed Cruz, a senator from Texas, was the most relentless counter-puncher, scoring points with a passionate and black-and-white approach to issues that appeals to evangelicals and the conservative wing of the party.\n\nDonald Trump, the billionaire businessman, delivered another entertaining performance in a city known for its entertainment value. While his debating skills may be below those of other candidates, he caters to his substantial support base with his take-no-prisoners, no-apologies, and confrontational style. He also displayed his showman skills during his humorous embrace of Ted Cruz near the end of the debate.\n\nLindsey Graham, a South Carolina senator, was the dominant winner of the undercard debate. His communication skills, honed by years of frequent TV talk-show appearances, outshone the rest of the field in the consolation debate. Graham, a veteran with three decades of service in the Air Force and Air Force Reserves, dominated the discussion on fighting terrorism and rebuilding the U.S. military.\n\nChris Christie, the New Jersey governor, performed well in the debate, particularly in his role as a former federal prosecutor after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He scored effective points when counterpunching against Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who became bogged down in a debate on Senate legislative minutiae. Christie also delivered the most pointed attack on President Obama, labeling him a \"feckless weakling.\"\n\nRand Paul, the Kentucky senator, delivered a more assertive performance than in previous debates but at times seemed evasive or circular in reasoning when the debate moderators tried to pin him down on his own positions or his differences with parts of the GOP debate.\n\nBen Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, was more confident and explicit in discussing his foreign policy positions, an area where he has struggled in the past. He retained the likeability that forms the core of his popularity.\n\nJeb Bush, the former Florida governor, gave a more assertive performance than in prior debates but still comes off as the middle daughter Jan from \"The Brady Bunch\" \u2013 always complaining about everything \"Donald, Donald, Donald.\"\n\nCarly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard CEO, seemed flat, grumpy, and indignant on stage. Her repeated efforts to inject herself into the debate with her screed \"This is what is wrong in Washington\" did not prove effective.\n\nJohn Kasich, the Ohio governor, came across as a dour college professor lecturing students rather than a presidential contender with an optimistic vision for America.\n\nIn summary, the fifth Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas showcased strong performances from Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Lindsey Graham, with each candidate demonstrating their strengths in various areas. The undercard debate was dominated by Lindsey Graham, who showcased his communication skills and military experience. The main debate saw Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Chris Christie deliver strong performances, while Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, and John Kasich faced criticism for their performances. Rand Paul and Ben Carson were mixed, with each displaying both strengths and weaknesses.",
    " Title: Obama to Campaign During Republican National Convention, Bucking Traditional Incumbent Behavior\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from traditional incumbent behavior, President Barack Obama will embark on an ambitious campaign next week, coinciding with the Republican National Convention. While the Republicans gather in Tampa, Florida, to nominate Mitt Romney for president, Mr. Obama will campaign on college campuses in Ames, Iowa, and Fort Collins, Colorado, on Tuesday, and in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Wednesday, the third day of the Republican convention. Vice President Joe Biden will be in Tampa for campaign events on the first two days of the Republican convention, and First Lady Michelle Obama will appear on \"The Late Show With David Letterman\" on Wednesday.\n\nPresidents typically do not campaign during the opposing party's convention, but this practice is not always adhered to by challengers. In 2008, both Mr. Obama and Republican John McCain campaigned during each other's nominating parties. In 2004, Democratic candidate John Kerry and running mate John Edwards campaigned during the GOP convention. In 1988, both George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis campaigned during the other's convention.\n\nObama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki stated that Mr. Obama, the first lady, and Mr. Biden will be \"laying out the choice the American people are facing in November, cutting through some of the political chatter\" while Republicans are meeting. Stephen Hess, a scholar on the presidency at the Brookings Institution, downplayed the suggestion that the 24/7 news media cycle is responsible for breaking the unwritten rule about not campaigning during an opponent's convention.\n\nAs Mr. Obama tries to re-energize young voters next week on three college campuses, a poll shows what the president is facing. The survey by the nonprofit group Generation Opportunity found that 89 percent of voters younger than 30 say the economy is affecting their daily lives negatively. The poll also found that 64 percent of young voters think the availability of more quality, full-time jobs upon graduation is more important than lower student-loan interest rates, an issue on which Mr. Obama waged a high-profile battle with Congress this summer.\n\nThe survey also indicates that young voters are motivated to vote this year, with 76 percent saying they intend to go to the polls in November. However, it might not be good news for Mr. Obama, who is seeking to recapture the youth vote that helped him win four years ago. The unemployment rate for 18- to 29-year-olds overall in July was 12.7 percent; it was 22.3 percent for blacks in the same age range. If the 1.7 million young adults who have given up looking for jobs are included, the actual unemployment rate for voters younger than 30 is 16.7 percent. The poll did not ask voters for their preference in the presidential election.",
    " Title: FDA's Oversight of Opioid Prescription Training Program Questioned in New Study\n\nArticle:\n\nMore than a third of opioid-related deaths in the United States can be traced back to long-acting drugs like OxyContin, which are approved for prescription by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine has criticized the FDA for lax oversight of a federal program designed to educate doctors about the risks of prescribing addictive opioids.\n\nResearchers from Johns Hopkins University examined thousands of pages of internal FDA documents obtained through public records requests and found that the agency has failed to adequately track the effectiveness of its Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program, a training program for doctors prescribing long-acting opioids. The program, introduced in 2012, requires opioid manufacturers to pay for this training and to monitor its impact on overdoses and deaths.\n\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins researchers, the FDA has not been able to demonstrate that its training program has been effective. Opioid manufacturers did not collect the necessary data to track the training's progress, and even after the FDA became aware of this issue, the agency did not take corrective action, the study found.\n\nCaleb Alexander, an author on the study, told the New York Times, \"What's surprising here is the design of the program was deficient from the start.\" As early as 2013, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services warned that the FDA was \"not receiving crucial information from pharmaceutical manufacturers\" about the training.\n\nThe data collected by the FDA is not encouraging. The goal was for 60 percent of doctors who prescribe long-acting opioids to enroll in a training class, but only 27 percent of them did between 2012 and 2016, according to the Johns Hopkins study. Manufacturers also surveyed physicians who participated in the training, and concluded they had \"modestly greater\" knowledge of safe prescribing practices. However, these surveys were conducted during a period when opioid prescribing rates were decreasing overall in the United States, and they were not designed to prove the classes were responsible for the change.\n\nIn response to the study, an FDA spokesperson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the issue of opioid misuse is a top priority for the Trump administration. The spokesperson noted that assessing the impact of the training program while accounting for other opioid interventions at the municipal, state, and federal levels could be challenging. He added that after learning about difficulties with the data assessment, the agency has discussed with drug manufacturers how to better study the effect of the training on prescriber behavior and patient outcomes, and continues to work with these companies to evaluate the impact of the program.\n\nThe spokesperson also highlighted that the FDA has taken other steps to address the opioid epidemic, such as going after illegal imports and sales of opioids and supporting more treatment for people struggling with addiction.\n\nAfter reaching a peak in 2012, opioid prescription rates fell in 2017\u2014to 58.7 prescriptions per 100 people nationally, compared with 81.3 prescriptions per 100 people in 2012. However, rates are still high in certain parts of the country, and while deaths are now starting to drop, nearly 50,000 people around the country died from opioid overdoses in 2017, a record high.",
    " Title: Obama Addresses HealthCare.gov Fiasco and ACA Implementation Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his press conference on Thursday, President Barack Obama addressed the ongoing issues with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the rollout of HealthCare.gov, the website serving as the portal to the ACA's new insurance market. The website's launch on October 1 was marred by technical difficulties, and the prospects for smooth functioning by November 30, as promised by top officials, are not looking promising.\n\nThe ACA, often referred to as Obamacare, is a signature initiative of President Obama's presidency. The president acknowledged the frustrations he has experienced over the past few weeks, particularly the promise he made repeatedly that individuals could keep their existing health insurance plans under the ACA. However, more than 3 million Americans have received cancellation notices due to the ACA's requirements.\n\nDuring the press conference, Obama admitted that the assumption was that the majority of those with individual market plans would find better policies at lower costs or the same cost in the marketplaces. However, the \"grandfather clause\" \u2013 the provision of the law that allowed plans in place before the ACA passed to continue \u2013 did not work as intended.\n\n\"And again, that's on us, that's on me,\" Obama said, acknowledging the responsibility for the issue. \"And that's why we're \u2013 that's on me.\"\n\nThe president also addressed the embarrassment surrounding HealthCare.gov's ignominious debut, leading to questions about what he knew beforehand and when. When asked, Obama stated that he \"was not informed directly\" that the site would not be working as intended.\n\nObama also criticized the federal procurement system for technology, citing it as a significant factor in the ACA's implementation challenges. He suggested that the system is cumbersome, complicated, and outdated, making it difficult to implement new technology projects within the federal government.\n\nLooking ahead, President Obama indicated that he would engage in \"Monday morning quarterbacking\" regarding HealthCare.gov, suggesting that he should have seen the problems coming. However, he emphasized the need to move forward and address the ongoing issues with the ACA's implementation.",
    " Title: Texas Governor Rick Perry's Job Recruitment Campaigns Spark Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nTexas Governor Rick Perry's aggressive job recruitment campaigns, characterized by radio and magazine ads, personal appearances, and critical remarks about other states' business climates, have sparked controversy and backlash, particularly from prominent Democrats and some Republican business leaders.\n\nPerry's campaigns, which promise low-tax and pro-growth policies in Texas, have been criticized for their attacks on states like California and Illinois, with statements such as \"I hear building a business in California is next to impossible\" and \"an environment that, intentionally or not, is designed for you to fail.\"\n\nThese attacks have led to a political backlash, with Democrats mocking Perry's attempts to steal jobs as clownish and warning him to keep his hands off. California Governor Jerry Brown famously compared Perry's incursions into California to breaking wind.\n\nHowever, some observers argue that Perry's campaigns are a clever marketing strategy and smart politics. Mark McKinnon, a political strategist with deep Texas ties, told \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"At the end of the day, no matter how any of the [states] respond, people are left with two distinct messages: That guy down in Texas has got big brass balls and he's creating a lot of jobs.\"\n\nMcKinnon also noted that Perry's campaigns break the rules of interstate diplomacy and protocol. Perry has stepped up jobs raids into the blue states of Illinois and California this year, efforts that come as he looks to announce his next political step after the Texas legislative session concludes.\n\nPerry's bids to encourage companies to relocate, which critics call \"poaching,\" are the most aggressive in the nation, according to experts. Mark Muro, a senior fellow and director of policy for the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, stated, \"It's irresistible to a lot of governors, but Perry has been the leader. This is not necessarily the best way for state executives to spend time, but it's hard to resist. It's politically attractive, the chief executive is seen as, quote, 'trying to do something.' Any successful relocation offers the tried-and-true moment of the ribbon cutting, so it's pretty intoxicating stuff.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama's home state of Illinois has been in the sights of several Republican governors, including Chris Christie of New Jersey, Scott Walker of Wisconsin, and Rick Scott of Florida. They all have tried to lure Illinois companies to move and set up shop in what the GOP chief executives bill as their lower-tax, lower-regulation states. However, even Scott acknowledged, in a letter to members of the Illinois business community, that Texas is leading the way. He noted that the Sunshine State is \"nipping at the heels of Texas everyday, as we approach the No. 1 spot.\"\n\nSome of those who have been on the receiving end say that Perry raises eyebrows as much for his grating style as for the substance of his pitch. Doug Whitley, the president and CEO of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce, told \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"The biggest difference with Perry was, he was kind of like a Roman emperor coming into town with horns blowing in front of his arrival, his parade.\"",
    " Title: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's Condition Improves: Upgraded from Serious to Fair\n\nArticle:\n\nHospital officials at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center have upgraded the condition of Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from serious to fair. Tsarnaev, 19, was captured Thursday night in a backyard in the Boston suburb of Watertown, Massachusetts, and has been held at the medical center under heavy guard since then.\n\nThe U.S. attorney's Office for Massachusetts announced the change in Tsarnaev's condition via a tweet at noon Tuesday EDT. \"According to Beth Israel Deaconess, at noon today, Dzhokhar Tsarvaev's condition is listed as \u2018fair,\u2019\" the tweet read.\n\nTsarnaev, along with his deceased brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, are suspected of committing the Boston Marathon bombings that resulted in three deaths and over 170 injuries. Hours after the FBI released photos of the then-unidentified suspects, the Tsarnaev brothers allegedly committed a carjacking and murdered an MIT police officer before engaging in a firefight with authorities early Friday morning, which left Tamerlan Tsarnaev dead.\n\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev was arraigned on two terrorism-related charges on Monday. During a court hearing conducted at his bedside at Beth Israel, the 19-year-old suspect nodded his head in response to questions and answered \"no\" when asked if he had enough money to hire an attorney, according to a transcript of the proceedings. The criminal complaint charging Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with the bombings indicated the 19-year-old suffered wounds to his \"head, neck, leg, and hand.\"\n\nTsarnaev's next court hearing has been scheduled for May 30. The news of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's improving medical condition came as new details emerged concerning the brothers' plans had they not been captured or killed by authorities. The suspected bombers were reportedly thinking of going to New York City, according to a carjacking victim who spoke to authorities, as reported by CBS News.",
    " Title: US Employment Dips in September Due to Hurricane Impact, Unemployment Rate Remains Low\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States experienced a decline in employment in September for the first time since 2010, as the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on the jobs market became apparent. The Labor Department reported a loss of 33,000 jobs, with a record drop in employment in the leisure and hospitality sector. The department attributed the decline to the two storms, which struck Texas and Florida in late August and early September.\n\nEconomists had anticipated a rise of 90,000 jobs last month, but the hurricanes did not affect the unemployment rate, which slipped to 4.2%, the lowest since February 2001. The US Labor Department uses separate surveys to capture payrolls data and the unemployment rate.\n\nThe strongest job gains last month came in the health care and transportation and warehousing industries. However, employment in the leisure and hospitality sector shrank significantly, while job figures in many other industries, including construction and government, were largely unchanged.\n\nThe US has been experiencing one of the longest stretches of job creation in its history, with the economy adding a monthly average of over 170,000 jobs over the past year. Economists have predicted that this pace is unsustainable and anticipated it would slow.\n\nThe September report showed that average hourly earnings rose 0.5% from August and have now risen 2.9% over the past 12 months. Naeem Aslam, a ThinkMarkets analyst, said the earnings figure showed \"that job market slack is fading.\"\n\nDespite the weaker-than-expected wage gains, economists do not see anything in the September report to dissuade the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates before the end of the year, as expected. Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \"Unemployment is what matters, and this report therefore makes a December rate hike even more likely.\"\n\nRevised jobs estimates for July and August showed US employers added 38,000 fewer jobs than previously reported. However, Mr. Shepherson expects recovery to begin in October, with a bigger rebound in November.",
    " Title: Trump Urges House Republicans to Rally Behind Obamacare Repeal and Replace Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump will personally urge House Republicans to support legislation aimed at repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) on Tuesday. The push comes as GOP leaders prepare for a three-day effort that could determine the fate of the White House's agenda.\n\nThe president, known for his negotiating skills, will visit the Capitol to lobby conservatives who argue the plan does not go far enough, and centrists who have demanded more assistance for older Americans whose premiums would increase under the GOP plan.\n\nHouse Republicans, late Monday, announced they would set aside at least $75 billion to help individuals purchasing insurance who are not yet eligible for Medicare. The amended bill does not significantly increase tax credits for Americans aged 50 to 64, but it allows for the Senate to do so. The bill formalizes agreed-upon changes to Medicaid designed to appease a conservative bloc.\n\n\"This is our long-awaited chance to finally get rid of Obamacare,\" Mr. Trump said at a rally in Kentucky, home to vocal GOP opponents of the bill, Representative Thomas Massie and Senator Rand Paul. Mr. Trump stated he is willing to collaborate with Mr. Paul to make necessary changes to the health bill and then move on to tax reform.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus, a group of more than 30 Republicans who often clash with leadership, remains the most visible impediment to the bill in the lower chamber. Its chairman, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, said the group did not plan to take an official position on the bill late Monday, leaving the door open for negotiations with Mr. Trump and GOP leadership.\n\nRepublicans cannot afford to lose more than 21 GOP votes, as every Democrat is expected to reject the bill, which repeals most of Obamacare's taxes and its individual mandate, replaces the ACA's generous subsidies with refundable, age-based tax credits, and reins in and caps spending on Medicaid by 2020.\n\nA \"manager's amendment\" submitted late Monday would repeal many of Obamacare's taxes sooner, this year instead of 2018, while barring any more states from expanding their Medicaid populations and receiving generous federal matching funds outlined by the 2010 law. The implementation of the so-called \"Cadillac tax\" on particularly generous employer plans is moved back from 2025 to 2026.\n\nDemocrats have invited former Vice President Joseph R. Biden to the Capitol on Wednesday to rally in defense of Obamacare, stating the GOP bill would undo its extension of coverage to more than 20 million Americans.\n\nThe House Rules Committee will meet early Wednesday to vet final changes to the GOP replacement and set the terms of debate for floor votes on Thursday, the seventh anniversary of Obamacare's passage. Republicans in the Senate are already considering their own changes, so the House may need to revisit the plan in the future.\n\nAs written, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the plan would save over $300 billion but result in 24 million fewer people being insured a decade from now. Criticism of the plan continued to pour in Monday, as doctors' groups and America's Catholic bishops said there were laudable parts of the legislation but that it fell woefully short in maintaining coverage for needy Americans.\n\nRepublican leaders have pleaded with conservatives and outside lobbies for more time. They argue the bill, which leverages budget rules to avoid a Democratic filibuster later on, is merely the first part of a three-pronged strategy to lower health costs. Phase two involves regulatory action by the Trump administration, while phase three would require Democratic support for future GOP legislation.\n\nMr. Trump won over members of the Republican Study Committee by agreeing to amendments that would make changes to Medicaid on Friday. The changes would allow states to impose work requirements on able-bodied people in the program and let governors accept a block grant of federal funding for the program instead of a per-capita allotment.",
    " Title: College Students and Community Members Rally to Fill Democratic National Convention Stadium\n\nArticle:\n\nCollege students from various institutions across North Carolina and members of predominantly black churches in neighboring South Carolina are set to arrive in Charlotte in large numbers ahead of the Democratic National Convention. Their objective is to help fill the 74,000-seat Bank of America Stadium to capacity when President Barack Obama delivers his acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination on Thursday night.\n\nThe Democratic Party has expressed concern over the possibility of not filling the stadium, as polls indicate decreased voter enthusiasm for Obama and smaller crowds at his battleground state campaign rallies. However, Obama advisers maintain that the stadium will be filled for the speech, with Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry also set to speak on Thursday.\n\nAdam Fetcher, a campaign spokesman, stated, \"The response we've seen from the community has been incredible, and it's obvious that people have a big interest in owning a piece of the most open and accessible convention in history.\" He added, \"President Obama's speech on Thursday night will bring this election into focus for the American people, and it will be even more significant because so many North Carolinians will be there to see it.\"\n\nIn addition to convention delegates, volunteers, and other Democratic officials already in Charlotte for the party gathering, filling the remaining seats is a piecemeal process. College Democrats of North Carolina President Elena Botella stated that her school is busing 100 students to the speech, while Lonnie Randolph, the president of the South Carolina chapter of the NAACP, said several large black churches in his state are planning to send busloads of members to watch the president's speech.\n\nObama aides have distributed several thousand tickets to new campaign volunteers in North Carolina, with individuals who complete three volunteer shifts totaling nine hours receiving one ticket to the final speech. This volunteer ticketing program also serves to bolster Obama's grassroots network in North Carolina, a battleground state he won in 2008 for the first time in nearly 40 years. However, Obama is facing an uphill battle in North Carolina this time around, as the unemployment rate exceeds the national average and voters approved a gay marriage ban the day before the president announced his support for same-sex unions.\n\nComparisons to the 2008 Democratic National Convention, where Obama accepted the nomination before a capacity crowd at an 84,000-seat stadium in Denver, are likely. At that time, there was little concern over filling the stadium due to Obama's ability to attract tens of thousands of people to his campaign rallies across the country. This year, Obama's crowds are significantly smaller, with his largest audience being a 14,000-person crowd at his campaign kick-off rally in May at Ohio State University. Approximately 13,000 people attended Obama's rally at the University of Colorado in Boulder on Sunday.\n\nThe campaign states that the size of Obama's events this summer have been intentionally kept low due to the increased costs and security requirements for a sitting president compared to a candidate. Convention organizers in Charlotte may have more control over the crowds than their other major concern: the weather. Heavy evening rains drenched Charlotte over the weekend, and thunderstorms are forecast for Thursday. Officials have stated that the outdoor event will proceed rain or shine, except in the case of severe weather.",
    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's Visit with President Obama Sparks Political Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie's visit with President Barack Obama has sparked political speculation, with pundits and campaign aides questioning the governor's motives. The visit, intended to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, has been portrayed as a potential move to secure the ear of the federal government for New Jersey or as a political maneuver for Christie's potential 2016 presidential bid.\n\nAs President Obama praised Christie's leadership, Romney aides downplayed the partnership, with Kevin Madden, a Romney adviser, stating, \"He's a governor focused on his job. He has said he's not looking at this through the lens of politics. He's right, and I expect most folks are looking at it just like the governor is.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney also emphasized that the visit should not be seen as a political event, stating, \"This is a time to focus on what was a devastating storm and the terrible aftermath of that storm.\"\n\nHowever, Christie has not completely set aside politics, as he has criticized Democrats in the State Legislature and picked fights with the Democratic mayor of Atlantic City.\n\nBefore the visit, Christie mentioned several times that he and the president had spoken \"just the two of us,\" and that the president had insisted that if he had any problems, he was to call him directly. Mike DuHaime, an adviser to Christie, stated that the governor was acting true to form, saying, \"He calls 'em as he sees 'em. If they're working well together, he's going to say it.\"\n\nChristie has not announced whether he will run for a second term, but if he does, Election Day is a mere year and five days away. His approval ratings are high in New Jersey, but President Obama's are higher.\n\nRepublicans have previously criticized Christie for putting his own interests first, such as during his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention, where it took him 15 minutes to mention Mitt Romney's name. However, one Republican close to Romney stated that Christie would have been accused of playing politics if he had declined the president's post-storm visit, as New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had.\n\nDespite the political speculation, at least one resident of Point Pleasant Beach seemed to be staying on message, with someone etching \"ROMNEY\" in the sand.",
    " Title: 2020 Democratic Presidential Hopefuls to Address SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas\n\nArticle:\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates are set to speak at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas this weekend. The event, known for its focus on technology, film, and music, serves as an opportunity for the candidates to engage with young voters and distinguish themselves in a growing primary field.\n\nSenators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will speak on Saturday, while former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, and Washington Governor Jay Inslee will speak on Sunday.\n\nFormer Texas Representative Beto O'Rourke, who ran for the Senate last year but has not yet announced his 2020 intentions, is expected to attend a film premiere about his longshot Senate bid against Senator Ted Cruz. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who is not a presidential contender but is a rising star within the party, is scheduled to be interviewed onstage on Saturday night, according to The Guardian.\n\nTexas is an early primary state for Democrats, but it is a red state in the presidential election as a whole. However, O'Rourke's close race with Cruz suggests that the state could be gradually shifting towards becoming a purple state.\n\nThe candidates' presence at the festival also serves as a platform to promote their policies on universal healthcare and addressing the deficit, while aiming to project a cool image and network with potentially enthusiastic young voters who can provide support, volunteering, and social media promotion for their campaigns.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez told CBS News that events like SXSW offer real opportunities for the party ahead of the 2020 campaign. \"It's become an iconic national event, and I wanted to make sure people understood what we're doing at the Democratic Party to win,\" Perez said. He also cited the 2018 Texas Senate race as evidence that Texas could eventually be up for grabs for Democrats: \"Texas is very much in play for Democrats. We made tremendous progress.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling Revives American Indian-U.S. Treaty, Guarantees Hunting Rights on Federal Lands\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling on Monday, upheld a treaty signed in 1868 between the U.S. government and the Crow Tribe, overturning a century-old high court precedent and potentially guaranteeing American Indians hunting rights on some federal lands. The case, brought by Crow Tribe member Clayvin Herrera, challenged Wyoming's offseason hunting charges in 2014 for hunting bull elk on the Big Horn National Forest.\n\nMr. Herrera argued that the treaty, which guarantees American Indians \"the right to hunt on unoccupied lands of the United States so long as game may be found thereon,\" allowed him to hunt on the land. The Crow Tribe leaders signed the treaty, ceding roughly 30 million acres to settlers while retaining about 8 million acres.\n\nWyoming argued that the treaty expired when it gained statehood in 1890. However, the justices, in their 22-page opinion, sided with Mr. Herrera, stating that there is no evidence that Congress intended to abrogate the 1868 treaty with the Wyoming Statehood Act.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the court's opinion that there is no evidence that Congress intended to abrogate the 1868 treaty right through the Wyoming Statehood Act, or that the Crow Tribe would have understood it to do so. The court's decision gives \"life\" to the rights of American Indians by overruling the prior precedent.\n\nAdvocates for Mr. Herrera stated that the decision gives \"life\" to the rights of American Indians by overruling the prior precedent. Forrest Tahdooahnippah, a lawyer who specializes in tribal issues, said the decision gives \"life\" to the rights of American Indians by overruling the prior precedent.\n\nOne major issue for the justices was the language of the treaty, which said it applied to \"unoccupied lands.\" Wyoming argued that once it became a state, all of the lands were deemed occupied. The court rejected both arguments, though it did leave room for some regulations within the forest, including where Wyoming decides it has an interest in conservation.\n\nThe four dissenting justices argued that the majority was ignoring a clear precedent, citing a similar case in 1895 involving the same treaty language and the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes. That time, the justices ruled that the tribes' right to hunt was terminated when Wyoming gained statehood. The court then said if the tribe's rights didn't end, the state would lack the power to regulate the killing of game.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito called Monday's majority opinion \"wasted ink.\"",
    " Title: New NAFTA Successor Requires Higher Content Localization for Automakers, Awaits Congressional Ratification\n\nArticle:\n\nThe new rules for automakers in the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will require a higher percentage of a vehicle's content to be produced in North America to qualify for zero tariffs. The new requirement is set at 75 percent, an increase from the current 62.5 percent. However, the deal is still pending congressional ratification.\n\nAccording to Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor, and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich, the changes may not significantly encourage investment in the United States as most vehicles will likely meet the new thresholds easily. Even if the administration imposes higher tariffs on foreign car imports, investment may still be hesitant due to the unpredictability of President Trump's trade policies.\n\nEmployment in the auto industry has slightly increased under President Trump's administration, from about 955,800 in January 2017 to one million in November 2018. However, the number of vehicles manufactured in the United States has continued to decline, despite a slight uptick last summer. According to the Reshoring Initiative, announcements to increase investment or move companies back to the United States peaked in 2016.\n\nPresident Trump has renegotiated NAFTA and a bilateral trade deal with South Korea. The changes to the South Korea agreement were modest, but the revised NAFTA strengthens intellectual property rights in Canada. An investigation into China's trade practices concluded that Beijing had violated American intellectual property rights, leading to the imposition of tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese products. The two sides are currently in talks over a trade deal to resolve the dispute.\n\nIn a separate development, President Trump signed the \"Right to Try\" legislation into law in May, allowing terminally ill patients to seek access to experimental medicine that is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. A similar program known as compassionate use or expanded access has been in place since the 1970s, and the F.D.A. says it authorizes 99 percent of the requests it receives. The new law allows patients, with the approval of their doctor, to ask drug companies directly for access, rather than wait for approval by the agency.",
    " Title: Senate Overcomes Filibuster on National Defense Authorization Act, Setting Stage for Potential Presidential Veto\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate overcame a filibuster on the annual defense policy bill on Tuesday, marking a significant victory for Republicans and setting up a potential confrontation with President Barack Obama over a threatened veto on the bill. The National Defense Authorization Act, if passed, would authorize military spending, set policy for Guantanamo Bay detainees, and address specific issues that have arisen since the previous bill.\n\nThe bill, which is one of the few must-pass measures each year, would be the fifth veto of President Obama's tenure, according to Republicans. They argue that an Obama veto would be equivalent to a surrender given the popularity of the bill and the dangerous threats the military is facing overseas. A final vote is expected on Wednesday, and the bill will then be sent to the president's desk.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-AZ), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, expressed his disbelief at the prospect of a presidential veto, stating, \"I can not imagine a president of the United States vetoing a bill that authorizes the ability of Americans to defend this nation under these most challenging circumstances.\"\n\nIf President Obama follows through on his threat, it would provide the best opportunity yet for Congress to override him, requiring a two-thirds vote in each chamber. The Senate, which voted 73-26 on Tuesday to head off a filibuster, appears to have more than enough support. From the Democratic caucus, 21 members sided with Republicans.\n\nThe House fell short of two-thirds support last week, with the bill receiving a vote of 270-156. Ten Republicans joined 146 Democrats in opposition, and many of them may face intense pressure to support an override.\n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act sets spending levels and rewrites rules for the Pentagon for the fiscal year. This year's version includes a Defense Department prod to determine whether those working at military recruitment centers can be armed, a response to the Navy recruitment center shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in July. It also protects popular weapons programs such as the A-10 aircraft and calls for new strike fighters for the Navy and Marine Corps, presses ahead with development of a long-range bomber for the Air Force, and restores authority for a next-generation missile defense program.\n\nHowever, the bill has become entangled in a broader fight over government spending for fiscal year 2016. Republicans want more money for the Defense Department and have proposed classifying some of it as emergency war spending, helping to circumvent the 2011 debt law's automatic \"sequester\" cuts. Democrats insist that if the Defense Department gets an increase, an equal amount must go toward domestic spending. Such a move would require breaking the sequester caps outright.\n\nDemocrats have filibustered the annual defense spending bill but are divided over whether to filibuster the policy bill. The White House has stated that the policy bill and the spending bill are closely linked, and press secretary Josh Earnest said on Monday that the president would veto the bill \"quite simply because it includes an irresponsible way for funding our core national defense priorities.\"\n\nEven if the spending fight is resolved, the White House is troubled by the bill's restrictions on transferring detainees from the Guantanamo Bay facility in Cuba to the U.S., as President Obama has promised to shutter the prison. The latest version of the defense policy bill bans transfers to Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, and imposes stricter certifications from the Defense Department's secretary before transfers are made to other countries.\n\nThe outcome of the veto threat and the spending fight remains uncertain, but negotiations between the White House, Republican defense hawks, and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill are ongoing. The Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker John A.

The president honored victims, first responders, and the military in remarks at the Pentagon, while Vice President Pence paid tribute to the passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn his remarks at the Pentagon, President Trump stated, \"The terrorists who attacked us thought they could incite fear and weaken our spirit. But America cannot be intimidated, and those who try will soon join the long list of vanquished enemies who dared to test our mettle.\"\n\nThe president, who recently announced his administration's strategy for the long-running conflict in Afghanistan, which began in 2001 as a hunt for the organizers of the September 11 attacks, warned that \"we are making plain to these savage killers that there is no dark corner beyond our reach. No sanctuary beyond our grasp, and nowhere to hide anywhere on this very large Earth.\"\n\nTrump offered consoling words to the families of victims who gathered for Monday's ceremony and shared the story of a Pentagon police officer who rushed into the wreckage of the Pentagon and saved \"as many as 20 people\" over his nearly 36 hours working at the site. The attacks against the U.S., the president said, made the nation more resilient and continue to do so.\n\nAt the Pentagon, the president was preceded in his remarks by Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary James Mattis. Gen. Dunford declared, \"Americans are not made of cotton candy, we're not seaweed drifting in the current, we are not intimidated by our enemies, and, Mr. President, your military does not scare.\"\n\nVice President Pence, in his tribute to the passengers of United Airlines Flight 93, said, \"I and many others in our nation's capital were able to go home that day to hug our families because of the courage and selflessness of the heroes of Flight 93.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, the president and first lady Melania Trump observed a moment of silence on the South Lawn of the White House. The president and first lady stood with their hands over their hearts as a bell tolled at 8:46 a.m. and a Marine bugler played \"Taps.\" The president and first lady were joined by his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both of whom serve as advisers to the president. Other administration staff members present included Chief of Staff John Kelly, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, Economic Advisor Gary Cohn, White House Counsel Don McGahn, Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell, and Communications Director Hope Hicks.\n\nTrump offered no remarks during the brief White House event.",
    " Title: Sondland Testimony: Ambassador Confirms Conversation with Trump, but Clarifies No Direct Quid Pro Quo\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing impeachment inquiry, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday. President Trump claimed that Sondland's testimony should exonerate him of any wrongdoing in the impeachment proceedings.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before departing for Texas, Trump stated that Sondland's testimony signified \"it's all over\" for the impeachment proceedings and that the House inquiry into Trump should cease. However, Sondland's testimony provided a more nuanced account of the events.\n\nDuring his testimony, Sondland confirmed a conversation with Trump where he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine. Sondland stated, \"He was not in a good mood. And he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.'\"\n\nWhile Trump argued that Sondland's statement proves there was no quid pro quo between his administration and Ukraine, the central issue in the impeachment probe, Sondland clarified that he never heard directly from Trump about a quid pro quo linking military aid for Ukraine to politically advantageous investigations.\n\nHowever, Sondland did confirm that a meeting at the White House for Ukraine's president and a phone call with Trump would only happen if President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to an investigation into the 2016 U.S. election and the Bidens. He also stated that he presumed aid was linked to investigations.\n\nSondland testified that he sent an email on July 19, just days before the July 25 call at the center of the impeachment inquiry, where he laid out the issue in detail to members of the State and Energy departments and White House staff.\n\nLater in his testimony, Sondland admitted to working with Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukraine at Trump's \"express direction\" and pushing a \"quid pro quo\" with Kiev because it was what Trump wanted.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., described Sondland's testimony as \"a very important moment in the history of this investigation\" and stated that it showed \"for the first time that knowledge of this scheme was pervasive.\"",
    " Title: Fourth Explosion Rocks Austin, Texas: Police Investigate Possible Link to Previous Package Bombings\n\nArticle:\n\nAnother explosion in Austin, Texas, has left two people injured, and authorities are investigating whether it is connected to a series of package bombings that have gripped the city in fear. The latest blast occurred around 8:30 p.m. on Sunday in a suburban neighborhood known as Travis Country.\n\nAustin Police Chief Brian Manley told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Monday that the explosion may have been detonated by a trip wire, and if this is the case, it would demonstrate a higher level of skill than previously suspected. Manley stated that the blast was \"activated by someone either handling, kicking, or coming into contact with a trip wire that activated the device\" as they walked or rode their bikes through the area.\n\nManley said that the police are \"working under the belief\" that the explosion is related to the three previous ones, but investigators have yet to process the entire scene. He added that they are \"working under the belief that they are connected.\"\n\nThe first explosion occurred on March 2, resulting in the death of 39-year-old Anthony Stephen House. Two more package bombs exploded on March 12, killing 17-year-old Draylen Mason, wounding his mother, and injuring a 75-year-old woman. All three of these explosions were likely related and involved packages that had not been mailed or delivered by a private carrier but were left overnight on doorsteps.\n\nThe two men injured in Sunday's blast are in their 20s, with one sustaining non-life-threatening injuries, including nails in his leg. South Austin Medical Center officials reported that the men were in good condition.\n\nAuthorities have urged people within a half-mile radius to stay in their homes, and the scene needs to be processed and cleared of any hazards. Police will provide an update at 10 a.m.\n\nA witness described the explosion as a \"loud bang,\" and the neighborhood where it occurred is typically quiet, with a mix of families and professional residents. Thad Holt, a resident who lives near the site of the fourth explosion, said the neighborhood is \"very quiet\" and \"crime-free.\"\n\nSunday's explosion marks the fourth to rock Austin in less than three weeks, but the three previous blasts occurred on the east side of the city. The reward for information leading to an arrest in the deadly explosions has risen by $50,000 to a new total of $115,000. More than 500 officers, including federal agents, have conducted 236 interviews and followed up on 435 leads.",
    " Title: Indicted Roger Stone Mocks Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Denies Involvement in Russian Election Meddling\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Roger Stone, a longtime political consultant and advisor to President Donald Trump, was indicted on Friday on charges of lying about his role in Russian meddling during the 2016 election. On Saturday, Stone used his Instagram account to mock special counsel Robert Mueller, referring to the charges against him as a \"nothingburger.\"\n\nStone posted an image of Mueller dressed as a waiter holding an empty burger bun, captioned with the phrase \"Here\u2019s what Mueller has on me # nothingburger.\" Stone's social media posts are known for their candid and sometimes bizarre nature. After his arrest on Friday, Stone posted a photo of himself with the words \"Who framed Roger Stone,\" a reference to the 1988 movie \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\"\n\nThe indictment, which was unsealed on Friday, lays out investigators' understanding of efforts by the Trump campaign to learn about the website WikiLeaks' plans to release damaging information about Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Prosecutors claim that this information was stolen by Russian intelligence seeking to influence the election on Trump's behalf.\n\nThe allegations revolve around Stone's alleged contacts with WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign. He is accused of lying about his contacts with WikiLeaks, including dealings with the website's founder, Julian Assange, as well as interactions with members of the Trump campaign about stolen emails.\n\nAccording to the indictment, during the summer of 2016, Stone spoke to senior Trump Campaign officials about information WikiLeaks might have had that would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign. Stone was also contacted by senior Trump Campaign officials to inquire about future releases by WikiLeaks.\n\nStone has repeatedly stated his innocence and has accused Mueller of conducting a vendetta against him and the president. After his release on bail, Stone spoke outside a federal courthouse in Florida and made appearances on CNN and Fox News to denounce the charges and boast that he would never testify against the president.",

When asked about future advertising plans, she responded, \"Well, not for awhile. I think we have spent our time between the efforts of the campaign, and what I understand the'super PAC' Carly Fiorina is doing, we have spent our time making sure we have people on the ground.\"\n\nFiorina added, \"Of course, I take advantage of earned media any chance I get. The debates are a really important opportunity for me. Every time I get out on that debate stage more people say \u2018Oh, I didn\u2019t know she was running for president. I kind of like her.\u2019 So there will come a time for ads, but honestly, other candidates have already spent millions on ads and it\u2019s done nothing for them. So I think the time is not yet.\"\n\nRegarding the decline in her poll numbers, Fiorina argued that it was not due to attacks on her business record. \"If the attacks were working, you\u2019d start to see it in my favorable and unfavorables,\" she said, referring to poll data. \"And in fact, I have very, very strong fave and unfave ratings. I think what you are seeing is that in the debate, half the audience saw me for the first time. You don\u2019t make a sale in one impression. Also, we have been off national television for the last couple of weeks. We have been doing more regional media and more on the ground town halls.\"\n\n\"So I think you have to look at not every little bump in a poll\u2014you have to look at a trajectory,\" Fiorina concluded.",
    " Title: Poll Shows High Support Among Democrats for Semiautomatic Firearm Ban, Raising Concerns About Second Amendment Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent poll by YouGov has shown that 82 percent of Democrats support a ban on semiautomatic firearms, while they are evenly split on a total handgun ban. This revelation has sparked concerns among gun rights advocates, particularly those who support the Second Amendment, as the poll indicates a significant proportion of the Democratic Party supports imposing restrictions on firearm ownership.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted in the aftermath of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, has reignited the debate on gun control in the United States. The tragic incident left seventeen people dead, and the issue has since been thrust back into the limelight.\n\nDuring a town hall event on February 21, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch faced a hostile crowd at a CNN-hosted event in Sunrise, Florida. The event, which was described as an \"Orwellian two minutes of hate exercise\" by some, was met with criticism for its perceived bias against gun owners, conservatives, and Republicans.\n\nThe poll's findings have raised questions about the understanding of firearm terminology among respondents. For instance, when different respondents say they want to ban \"semi-automatic rifles,\" or that they support \"universal background checks,\" it is unclear what they actually mean. Lois Beckett, a journalist covering gun politics, has called on pollsters to survey Americans on their understanding of the basic terms of the debate.\n\nThe poll's results have sparked concerns among gun rights advocates about the potential impact on the Second Amendment if the Democratic Party's stance on gun control is reflected in future legislation. The high proportion of Democrats who support a semiautomatic firearm ban, as well as the party's stance on handguns, has raised questions about the possibility of imposing Australian-style gun bans and confiscatory policies in the United States.\n\nIn response to the poll, Lois Beckett, a journalist covering gun politics, tweeted, \"My plea to pollsters, as a journalist covering gun politics: can you survey Americans on their understanding of what the basic terms of this debate mean?\" and \"When different respondents say they want to ban'semi-automatic rifles,' or that they support 'universal background checks,' what do they actually mean?\"\n\nThe poll's findings have raised concerns about the potential impact on the Second Amendment if the Democratic Party's stance on gun control is reflected in future legislation.

    " Title: White House Opens to Possibility of Different Explanations for Benghazi Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo days after the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, described the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya as a \"spontaneous\" reaction to protests, the White House has opened the door to the possibility of other explanations. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stated on Tuesday that the FBI is investigating the incident, and the investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead.\n\nCarney clarified that the administration does not have any indication of premeditation or pre-planned attacks at this point, but they are not making declarations ahead of the facts. Significantly, Carney did not provide as detailed an account as Ambassador Rice did in her Sunday interviews, suggesting that the investigation could offer a different version of events.\n\nRice had stated that the administration believes the attack was not preplanned or premeditated but was a \"spontaneous\" reaction to protests in Egypt over an anti-Islam film, with extremist elements joining the fray before it \"spun out of control.\" However, this account clashes with claims by the Libyan president that the attack was in fact premeditated. Other sources, including an intelligence source in Libya who spoke to Fox News, have echoed those claims. The intelligence source even said that, contrary to the suggestion by the Obama administration, there was no major protest in Benghazi before the deadly attack which killed four Americans. A U.S. official did not dispute the claim.\n\nIn the face of these conflicting accounts, Carney on Tuesday deferred to the ongoing investigation. \"It is an absolute tragedy that we lost four Americans in Benghazi,\" he said. \"There is an active investigation underway about what happened and why and what the motivations were.\"\n\nSome have questioned how an attack that involved RPGs and mortar fire could have possibly been spontaneous. Carney, though, suggested that such weapons are readily available in post-revolution Libya. \"There are vast numbers of weapons and certainly a number of violent groups in the country,\" Carney said. \"It is still a very volatile place, there's no question about it.\"\n\nThe ongoing investigation will examine \"what role the video played\" in the attack, among other things, according to Carney. Fox News was told that the assault on the consulate came without warning and included RPGs and mortars, including at least one round that hit the consulate roof. There were two waves to the assault, Fox News was told. According to the intelligence source, in the first wave, the attackers were heard to say \"we got him\" - a reference to Ambassador Chris Stevens, who was killed in the attack. Word spread, the attackers regrouped, and the second wave went after the motorcade and support personnel.\n\nThe account relayed by the intelligence source on the ground in Libya is consistent with statements by the Libyan president that the attack was pre-mediated and the work of foreign fighters, which is code for Islamist extremists, including the Al Qaeda affiliate in North Africa. It is also consistent with an interview by McClatchy Newspapers with a purported Libyan security guard who was injured in the assault. The guard said the consulate area was quiet and \"there wasn't a single ant outside\" until dozens of armed men descended on the compound.\n\nEven before Ambassador Stevens' murder, U.S. officials say the CIA determined the security situation in eastern Libya was deteriorating based on four attacks, beginning in June, on diplomatic and Western targets in Benghazi, including the U.S. Consulate. That said, U.S. officials insist there was no specific warning of an armed assault, like the one that killed the four Americans.",
    " Title: Washington and Lee University Faculty Votes to Remove Robert E. Lee's Name\n\nArticle:\n\nThe faculty of Washington and Lee University has voted to remove the name of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from the Virginia institution. The decision was made during a meeting on Monday, with the resolution passing 188-51. A proposed motion to remove George Washington's name failed.\n\nThe faculty had initially added Lee's name to the university, then known as Washington College, in 1870, shortly after Lee's death. Alison Bell, head of the Faculty Affairs Committee, stated, \"Lee was a symbol of who the faculty wanted to be, and who they were. The faculty is now, 150 years later, asking the university for a name change because Lee does not represent who we are and who we want to be.\"\n\nThe student government formally requested the removal of Lee's name last week, and over 200 faculty members had signed a petition with the same objective. The board of trustees, which would need to approve the name change, is \"carefully monitoring developments regarding issues of race, monuments, and symbols of the Confederacy and their implications\" for Washington and Lee, a spokeswoman said last week.\n\nIn other parts of Virginia, Confederate names are being removed from public K-12 schools at a rapid pace, according to The Washington Post. Stonewall Middle School in Prince William County and Robert E. Lee High School in Fairfax County are among the schools undergoing name changes. Loudon County High School is also changing its mascot after the school board voted unanimously to drop the Raiders, a reference to Confederate Col. John S. Mosby\u2019s guerrilla troops.\n\nHistorians noted that the widespread rejection of Confederate iconography by Virginia schools is unprecedented, according to The Washington Post. James Grossman at the American Historical Association stated that Black students, parents, and communities have objected since the schools were named in the 1950s and '60s, in response to the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. Historian Adam Domby added, \"It was trying to make black students feel unwelcome, while white students and white communities were emboldened to resist desegregation.\"",

In an interview on Fox News' \"Fox and Friends\" on Thursday, Sekulow described the investigation as a \"terrible, terrible waste of taxpayer money.\"\n\nSekulow stated that the investigation, which Trump has referred to as a \"witch hunt,\" was \"kind of encapsulated exactly what this is.\" He added that Mueller, \"the architect, the person that's in charge of the investigation,\" was put on the stand, and the testimony was described as a \"disaster,\" \"train wreck,\" and \"horrible\" by commentators across various networks.\n\nSekulow also noted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to be putting on a \"happy face\" at her press conference on Wednesday, but even members of the Democratic Party recognized that the testimony was a \"train wreck.\"\n\nAccording to Sekulow, there were 12-13 prosecutors who attempted to create a collusion, conspiracy, and obstruction narrative, but despite their efforts, they were unable to do so.\n\nOne of the most significant issues, Sekulow said, was when Mueller was asked about the exoneration narrative. He stated that Mueller was asked if there was any historical precedent for the policy on exoneration, to which Mueller responded that there was not. Sekulow argued that this indicates the president is being treated differently than any other citizen in terms of the burden of proof.\n\nRegarding the arrests made during the investigation, Sekulow stated that there has been no discussion, as far as he knows, concerning whether some of those arrested will eventually be pardoned. However, he did note that there has been a lot of injustice in the case.",
    " Title: Deadly 7.8-Magnitude Earthquake Strikes Nepal, Triggering Avalanches and Destruction\n\nArticle:\n\nA devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit Nepal over the weekend, resulting in at least 4,400 deaths and over 8,000 injuries, according to reports by Associated Press journalists Binaj Gurubacharya and Katy Daigle. The earthquake caused avalanches at Mount Everest base camp, resulting in at least 18 fatalities. Most of the casualties occurred in Nepal, but there are also reports of victims in India, Bangladesh, and along the Nepal-China border.\n\nThe earthquake brought down Dharahara Tower, a popular historical landmark in Kathmandu, built in 1832 and recognized by UNESCO. The tower, which attracted hundreds of visitors to ascend to its top on weekends, collapsed in the quake.\n\nThe full extent of the damage from the quake, which struck around noon, is still unknown as rescue workers continue to navigate through the rubble, particularly in the heavily populated Kathmandu Valley, where building quality is often low. Home Ministry official Laxmi Dhakal has stated that the death toll will likely rise.\n\nFurther earthquakes and aftershocks have complicated rescue operations. \"There have been nearly 100 earthquakes and aftershocks, which is making rescue work difficult,\" Kathmandu district chief administrator Ek Narayan Aryal told the Associated Press. \"Even the rescuers are scared and running because of them.\"\n\nThe initial earthquake was considerably more powerful than the one that devastated Haiti in 2010, and the same magnitude as the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco. However, it falls below Nepal's worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured at 8.0 and ravaged the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Patan.\n\nGerman climber Jost Kobusch shared horrifying footage of an avalanche that reportedly hit a Mount Everest base camp in the aftermath of the initial earthquake. In the video, someone says, \"The ground is shaking,\" before a wall of snow overwhelms a camp with dozens of tents. Two people are shown taking cover from the avalanche as they are pelted by ice and snow. They then walk around, showing the remains of the leveled camp.\n\nAvalanches killed at least 18 people and injured at least 61 more in Nepal over the weekend, according to the Associated Press's Gurubacharya and Daigle. However, Kobusch survived, according to CNN.\n\nBeyond the toll on human life, disasters like this earthquake greatly strain impoverished countries like Nepal. The South Asian country's economy relies heavily on tourism from trekkers and mountain climbers, many of whom are attracted to Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world.\n\nExperts had warned of a tragic earthquake in Nepal a week before it occurred. A week ago, about 50 earthquake and social scientists from around the world came to Kathmandu, Nepal, to discuss how to prepare the area better for a potential earthquake. Seismologist James Jackson, head of the earth sciences department at the University of Cambridge in England, told the Associated Press that he did not expect such a huge earthquake to hit so soon, but experts were warning that something like it was possible.\n\nNot only is Nepal situated on a natural seismic fault, but local infrastructure is so poorly built to resist earthquakes that the tremors can lead to far more casualties than they would in other places across the world. US Geological Survey seismologist David Wald estimated to the Associated Press that the same level of severe shaking would lead to 10 to 30 deaths per million residents in California but kill 1,000 or more in Nepal and up to 10,000 in parts of Pakistan, India, Iran, and China.\n\n\"They knew they had a problem,\" Hari Kumar, southeast Asia regional coordinator for GeoHazards International, which works on global earthquake risks, told the Associated Press. \"But it was so large they didn't know where to start, how to start.\"",

The program, a version of the DREAM Act that failed to pass through Congress, could potentially benefit up to 1.8 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nTo qualify, applicants must fill out a six-page form, pay a $465 fee, and submit documents verifying their identity. They must demonstrate that they arrived in the U.S. before turning 16 and are either enrolled in school or vocational training, have a high school diploma, or are military veterans.\n\nImmigration officials have stated that the applications will be thoroughly scrutinized due to the potential for fraud, but there is no uniform standard. The lines for passport applications began forming on Tuesday.\n\nKristi Alarcon, an applicant, told MyFoxHouston, \"We are waiting for our passports. We want to get our passport because Obama might be asking for them.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles, advocates held workshops on Wednesday to guide applicants through the application process. The turnout on Tuesday and Wednesday is the most visible demonstration to date of the interest in the administration's new reprieve program.\n\nThe requirements for the DACA program are less stringent than those of the original DREAM Act. Applicants must be in school, have a high school diploma or GED, or be a military veteran. They cannot have a felony record, but a record with fewer than three minor misdemeanors is not disqualifying.\n\nUnder the DREAM Act, applicants not only had to show a high school diploma or GED, but after a six-year period, they had to demonstrate that they had attended college or served in the military for at least two years.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have criticized Obama for implementing the program, claiming it is an attempt to bypass Congress and favor illegal immigrants over unemployed U.S. citizens. Some, including House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, have labeled the policy a \"backdoor amnesty\" and expressed concerns about fraud.\n\n\"While potentially millions of illegal immigrants will be permitted to compete with American workers for scarce jobs, there seems to be little if any mechanism in place for vetting fraudulent applications and documentation submitted by illegal immigrants,\" Smith said Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Homeland Security announced the details of the documents illegal immigrants would need to provide to prove their eligibility for the Obama administration's DACA program. The announcement came a day before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting applications for the program.\n\nThe program is launching just months before a tight White House contest, in which the Hispanic vote may play a significant role. Obama has faced criticism from Hispanic voters and others who believe he has not fulfilled a previous campaign promise to reform the nation's immigration laws.",

If Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu does not win more than half the vote in the general election, she will likely face a one-on-one runoff with Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy in Louisiana. In Georgia, both parties are preparing for a potential nine-week runoff ending in January.\n\nIn Louisiana, Republicans are reserving hotel rooms and millions of dollars worth of ad time, signaling their readiness to pour money into the state after November. If the race goes to a runoff, Democrats believe their best shot at winning is to secure a majority in the initial election, taking advantage of a split between Cassidy and his main conservative opponent, Rob Maness.\n\nIn Georgia, both parties have built an infrastructure they are planning to rely on if the race goes to a runoff. Republicans, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, have reserved significant amounts of TV time for the potential runoff, while conservative outside groups have also booked ad time. Democrats have yet to reserve airtime in Louisiana, and both sides are staying off the air for the runoff in Georgia\u2014for now.\n\nIf a runoff occurs, Democrats in Louisiana are planning an aggressive ground and aerial attack to keep the seat, while Republicans, such as Cassidy, are focusing on uniting GOP support behind their candidate by opposing President Barack Obama. Both parties are remaining tight-lipped about their runoff plans, with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Landrieu herself emphasizing their focus on winning both races on Election Day.",
    " Title: Obama to Deliver Economic Speech at Knox College, Kicking Off Series Ahead of Budget Deadlines\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama will deliver an economic speech at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois on Wednesday, marking the beginning of a series of speeches on the economy over the next several weeks. The speeches are intended to precede key budget deadlines in the fall, including the start of the new fiscal year in October and the approaching government borrowing limit.\n\nThe address comes a week before Congress is scheduled to recess for a month, and the White House aims to apply public pressure on lawmakers to avoid the tax and spending showdowns that have characterized past budget debates.\n\nThe extensive White House preparations for the economic speech suggest that Obama is embarking on a different kind of agenda, focusing on leaving a historical legacy rather than delivering new policy announcements. The speech may serve as a retrospective on the economy's condition when Obama took office and its current state.\n\nIn addition to the economic discussion, the speech is expected to touch on topics such as green energy, investment, the importance of the middle class, and the notion of the wealthy paying their fair share. After the Knox College speech, Obama will travel to Missouri and Florida to deliver similar messages.\n\nOne point of interest will be how Obama presents Obamacare as part of an overall improved economy. Last week, when he spoke on healthcare, the Associated Press fact-checker criticized Obama for overstating the benefits of his signature healthcare legislation. Another issue to watch is how Obama will handle his approach to Republicans who refuse to vote for an increase in the debt ceiling without the defunding of Obamacare in return. Congress has only a few weeks to reach a deal.\n\nHowever, it is likely that today's speech is not primarily about the economy. RealClearPolitics suggests that Obama may be increasingly considering his legacy and how he will be remembered in history. Speeches are a useful tool for leaving a lasting impression, while sifting through old unemployment data is not as exciting.\n\nThe speech is scheduled for 12:55 ET and will be streamed live at WhiteHouse.gov.",
    " Title: Former Chinese Censor Claims Interview for TikTok Content Monitoring Role\n\nArticle:\n\nA former Chinese internet censor, Liu Lipeng, has claimed that he was interviewed for a role monitoring and policing videos posted by international users of TikTok, a Chinese-owned short video app. Liu, who worked as an online censor in China for a decade, said he was passed over for the job in 2018 after suggesting during the interview that TikTok should not overly censor content due to Americans' value for freedom of speech.\n\nLiu described ByteDance Technology Co., TikTok's parent company, as \"the largest and most terrifying censorship machine\" he has ever seen. His claims coincide with rising public concerns over TikTok's ties to the Chinese regime and come as the Trump administration considers banning the app over national security risks.\n\nLiu, who built his career as a \"content reviewer\" for popular Chinese media apps Weibo and Leshi, said he was interviewed for a content manager position that would inspect \"globalized videos\" on TikTok. The job recruitment notice mentioned globalized videos. Alongside TikTok, ByteDance runs a Chinese version of the app named Douyin.\n\nDuring the interview, Liu expressed a different vision for the role, stating, \"I understand more about how much Americans care about freedom of speech, and therefore, we shouldn't overregulate.\" Liu was ultimately rejected because of these views, he believes.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The app has previously stated it does not use Chinese moderators to handle content on TikTok. In March, the company announced it would open a \"transparency center\" in Los Angeles to allow outside experts to see how TikTok moderates content.\n\nLiu, who moved to the United States in March, said being in the United States means that he needs to defend U.S. interests, and there's \"no turning back.\" He noted that the CCP's censorship apparatus has become more restrictive over the past decade, with recruitment being more open and requiring strong \"political awareness.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time TikTok has drawn scrutiny for imposing Beijing-style censorship on overseas users. The company has previously been criticized for closing the account of a Chinese international student in New Jersey after he posted a video spoofing the Chinese national anthem and for suspending the account of a U.S. teen who posted a video criticizing Beijing's suppression of Uyghur Muslims in China's far-western Xinjiang region.\n\nA U.S. review panel is currently probing ByteDance's $1 billion acquisition of U.S. social media app Musical.ly\u2014which was rebranded to TikTok\u2014in 2017. It is investigating whether the deal raised national security risks. The Pentagon last year ordered U.S. military personnel to delete TikTok from their work phones, while Wells Fargo recently followed suit, and the Democratic and Republican National Committees have warned staff members about using the app.\n\nFollowing India's recent decision to ban TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps, the Trump administration confirmed that it was also considering a similar move. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said on July 15 that a number of administration officials were \"looking at the national security risk as it relates to TikTok, WeChat, and other apps.\" \"I don't think there's any self-imposed deadline for action, but I think we are looking at weeks, not months,\" Meadows said.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Address Economic Inequality and Social Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing discourse surrounding the American economy and social policies, several Democratic presidential candidates have expressed concerns about economic inequality and the need for systemic reforms.\n\nOne candidate has highlighted the decline of the American Dream, citing increased farm bankruptcies, contaminated water supplies, opioid deaths, and high poverty rates, particularly among children. The candidate proposes rewriting the rules of the 21st-century economy to ensure it benefits all Americans.\n\nThe proposed solutions include rewriting the tax code to make big corporations pay their fair share in taxes, and using the resulting funds to reinvest in the American people. The candidate also advocates for the Freedom Dividend, a monthly $1,000 payment to every American adult over 18, with the aim of reducing poverty, creating jobs, and providing a financial foundation for individuals.\n\nAnother candidate emphasizes the importance of community colleges in preparing students for employment and aligning curricula with skills that lead to good jobs. They also propose federal student aid for quality short-term certificate programs with strong outcomes, extending the earned income tax credit and unemployment insurance to Americans in training programs, and bridging the prosperity divide in America.\n\nThe candidates also address the issue of low unemployment, suggesting that it should be the starting point for good social policy, not the end. They argue that a strong labor market creates political space to address social problems such as child care, health care, college costs, and environmental protection, which cannot be solved by a 'good economy' alone.\n\nIn addition, the candidates have voiced concerns about the potential escalation of conflict in the Middle East following the assassination of Qassem Soleimani. They question the strategic and moral implications of the action, and the potential for it to lead to a new war with Iran. They call for a careful consideration of the consequences of such a conflict, and the need for a clear war aim and strategy.\n\nFinally, they urge influential Republican senators to remind the president of his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires and to prevent the president from stumbling further into war with Iran.",
    " Title: National Debt Surpasses $22 Trillion Under Trump Administration, Contrasting Early Campaign Promises\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Treasury Department reported Tuesday that the national debt has reached a record $22.012 trillion, marking the first time it has surpassed the $21 trillion threshold. This figure represents a $2.065 trillion increase since President Donald Trump took office in 2017, when the debt stood at $19.947 trillion.\n\nThe department's fiscal statement attributes part of this increase to the rising costs of Medicare and Social Security, but also cites the trillion-dollar deficit resulting from the tax cuts enacted in 2017, which primarily benefited corporations and the wealthy.\n\nDuring his 2015 campaign, Trump had promised to reduce the national debt, stating he would \"reduce our $18 trillion in debt\" if elected president. At his official campaign launch, he claimed he would \"bring back the American dream bigger and better and stronger than ever before\" and \"make America great again.\" In December 2015, he also pledged to \"freeze the budget,\" a promise that has not been fulfilled.\n\nSince his election, Trump has suggested that tariffs would enable him to start paying down the debt. However, the ongoing trade war resulting from these tariffs has reportedly caused significant harm to the agricultural industry, with American farmers uncertain about the impact of negotiations with countries like China, a major buyer of U.S. soybeans.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has been less vocal about the national debt, tweeting about it only a handful of times, including in February 2017, November 2017, and August 2018. His budget proposals have instead been projected to add $7.2 trillion more to the debt over the next 10 years.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump frequently criticized President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for increasing the debt, alleging their policies had added $9 trillion. Since taking office, Trump has been less vocal about the debt, focusing on other issues. His first joint address to Congress and subsequent State of the Union addresses did not mention the debt, the budgetary deficit, or any fiscal policy.\n\nIn response to the Treasury Department's report, Trump's budget director and current chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, dismissed budget promises as \"hyperbole.\" It remains unclear if the Trump administration has a plan to reduce the now-$22 trillion debt.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Recall Election: Obama Blames Outspending Democrats for Walker's Victory\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Wisconsin recall election on Tuesday, President Barack Obama has attributed the victory of Governor Scott Walker to the Republicans' outspending Democrats during the campaign. Walker, who defeated Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett in a repeat of their 2010 showdown, has suggested that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney could make a play for Wisconsin in the general election.\n\nThe state has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1984, but Walker stated that while Romney \"is an underdog,\" he can compete if he presents a bold platform. Walker told MSNBC on Wednesday that \"anyone looking at the results last night would also acknowledge that it\u2019s now competitive in Wisconsin.\"\n\nThe central issue in the Wisconsin recall election was the Republican state government's decision to break the public employees unions' grip on setting members' taxpayer-funded salaries and benefits, a move the GOP argued was necessary to address unsustainable liabilities, a problem many other states also face.\n\nThrough his spokesman Jay Carney, President Obama expressed his view that the fight was unfair due to the Republicans' significant fundraising and spending advantage over the Democrats in the state, with a large portion of the funds coming from corporate and out-of-state sources.\n\nIn 2010, Walker won the governorship on a union-taming platform by a 4-percentage-point margin. Republicans view Tuesday's 7-point margin as a positive sign, potentially indicating growing voter discontent with Democrats' ties to unions. However, whether the Walker win signals a nationwide trend of growing discontent with union power remains unclear.\n\nIn Ohio, Governor John Kasich signed a law stripping collective bargaining rights from public employees, only to see the law repealed in a referendum by a 2-to-1 margin. In another Wisconsin recall election on Tuesday, a union-backed Democrat unseated a state senator, shifting control of the chamber to the Democrats.\n\nWhile Republicans in Wisconsin are optimistic about the election results, outside analysts are more cautious. John Zogby, a pollster who conducts polling for The \u2588\u2588\u2588, stated, \"I don\u2019t see Wisconsin in play. On Tuesday, voters there chose Obama over Romney and they also chose stalemate.\"\n\nIn response to the Wisconsin results, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel has called for Democrats to increase their fundraising efforts ahead of the general election. Israel stated, \"The Wisconsin results should serve as a wake-up call for Democrats: on-the-ground organizing is critically important, but it must be coupled with an aggressive air campaign.\"\n\nAs the general election approaches, the focus remains on how the financial resources of both parties will be allocated. Republicans, who in the past have complained about deep-pocket Democratic donors outnumbering and outgiving their Republican counterparts, are now facing similar concerns from the Democratic side. Israel noted, \"Democratic groups won\u2019t outspend Republican groups, but they can keep us in the fight.\"",
    " Title: Federal Investigation Intensifies in Boston Marathon Bombing Case\n\nArticle:\n\nThree days after the Boston Marathon bombing, hundreds of federal investigators are actively pursuing the identity of a man seen acting suspiciously on video footage from a department store across the street from the second explosion site. The individual, described as a young white man wearing a black jacket, a gray hooded sweatshirt, and a white or off-white baseball cap on backwards, is the focus of the investigation.\n\nAccording to FBI personnel, video security clips from Lord & Taylor department store show the man dropping a bag and then leaving the area. Images also reveal him exiting the site shortly after the first explosion, before the second explosion occurred. A spokeswoman for Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, Dot Joyce, told The Boston Globe that the Lord & Taylor camera is the best source of video footage so far, and that investigators are making progress.\n\nInvestigators are currently going through cellphone call logs line by line, attempting to determine who made calls from the location around the time of the bombing. They have cellphone owner information they are trying to match to the elusive man.\n\nCBS News correspondent John Miller, a former FBI assistant director, stated that federal authorities decided to release images from the Lord & Taylor video in an effort to enlist the public in identifying the man. However, they have yet to decide whether to proceed with this tactic, according to Miller.\n\nReports on Wednesday suggested that a suspect had been arrested, citing law enforcement sources. However, the FBI later issued a statement denying such an arrest and asking for media outlets to exercise responsibility and restraint in their reporting on the case.\n\nOn Thursday, reports indicated that the FBI is also seeking the identification of a second person captured on video who was seen carrying a backpack and behaving suspiciously in the vicinity of the first person of interest. The Los Angeles Times reported that the image showing two men is the first indication that more than one bomber may have been responsible for the attacks.\n\nThe FBI is reportedly using modern facial recognition software to speedily look for matches in FBI databases of arrest photos and criminal suspects. Surveillance cameras in airports and other public locations can also be programmed to look for people with similar features.\n\nThe nation remains on edge in the wake of the Boston Marathon tragedy. An explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, causing many casualties, added to the sense of American unease. In Washington, the FBI announced the arrest of a Mississippi man, Paul Kevin Curtis, in the mailing of letters laced with the poison ricin to President Obama and at least one US senator. President Obama is set to travel to Boston on Thursday for a memorial event for Boston Marathon bombing victims.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick told the AP that the public's frustration with the lack of arrests is shared, but cautioned that the case will not be resolved \"by magic.\" Governor Patrick stated, \"It's going to happen by doing the careful work that must be done in a thorough investigation, which means going through the couple of blocks at the blast scene inch by square inch and picking up pieces of evidence and following those trails, and that's going to take some time.\"",
    " Title: White House and Congressional Leaders Push for Third Coronavirus Spending Package, Totaling Hundreds of Billions\n\nArticle:\n\nWhite House officials and congressional lawmakers are signaling their intention to advance a third coronavirus spending package, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while the Senate works on a more modest second relief bill. The White House is reportedly pushing for an $850 billion stimulus, primarily in the form of tax relief measures.\n\nAccording to Fox News, approximately $500 billion of this would be tied to a payroll tax cut, while $250 billion would come in the form of Small Business Administration loans, and $58 billion would be directed to the airline industry, among other measures. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is set to discuss the details of the comprehensive coronavirus proposal with Senate Republicans at a larger-than-usual policy lunch on Tuesday.\n\nMnuchin, when asked about the proposal's cost on Monday, stated, \"I\u2019m not going to comment on the numbers now. But it\u2019s a big number.\" The Washington Post reported Tuesday that Mnuchin's proposal would come with an $850 billion price tag, focusing mainly on putting cash in the hands of individuals and businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Democrats will hold their weekly lunch via conference call, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer likely discussing a $750 billion proposal he announced Monday to address the coronavirus and the economic crisis. Schumer stated, \"As early as tomorrow, I will present a series of proposals to Congressional appropriators that Senate Democrats believe should be part of the next bill to address the coronavirus.\"\n\nSenate Democrats' proposal includes expanded unemployment insurance and Medicaid funding, addressing strained hospital capacity, providing urgent assistance to small businesses, and assisting schools in transitioning to remote learning as more states close down their public schools.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., backed Schumer's call for a $750 billion arsenal to battle the coronavirus and its economic effects in an op-ed for CNN Monday. It is unclear what exactly will be in Mnuchin's proposal to Senate Republicans, but there is a chance there could be significant overlap with Schumer's ideas.\n\nIn an interview with Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Mnuchin emphasized the need for a \"big stimulus program because we need to help American workers now.\" Mnuchin made clear that the administration is not asking for a bailout, stating, \"If you\u2019re providing liquidity to good businesses that just need liquidity for 3 to 6 months, that\u2019s not a bailout.\"\n\nOther lawmakers have proposed ideas to combat the coronavirus and help Americans affected by the economic shutdown. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, suggested providing every American with a $1,000 check to cover expenses due to layoffs, forced leave, or other coronavirus-related expenses. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, proposed a similar idea last week, introducing a nonbinding House resolution to provide each American with a monthly $1,000 payment until the coronavirus threat subsides.\n\nThese proposals appear similar to former Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang's universal basic income (UBI) idea, but are distinguished from it mainly because they are temporary, stopgap measures.",
    " Title: Michael Flynn's Lawyers Cease Communications with Trump's Legal Team in Ongoing Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nLawyers for former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn have halted communications with U.S. President Donald Trump's legal team, potentially marking a significant development in the ongoing investigation into contacts between Trump's election campaign and Russia, sources familiar with the investigation said on Friday.\n\nFlynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, reportedly called John Dowd, Trump's private lawyer, on Wednesday to say the matter had reached a point where the two could no longer discuss it, two people familiar with the call told sources on Friday. The New York Times first reported that the two sets of lawyers had stopped communicating.\n\nIt is unclear whether Kelner made the call because he had negotiated a plea agreement with Special Counsel Robert Mueller for Flynn to cooperate in the probe, or because Flynn had decided to engage with Mueller, said two other sources.\n\n\"No one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about General Flynn cooperating against the president,\" Jay Sekulow, another attorney for Trump, said on Thursday.\n\nDowd, Mueller's spokesman John Carr, Kelner, and White House officials declined to comment on the matter.\n\nFlynn, a retired Army general, is a central figure in a federal investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether Trump aides colluded with alleged Russian efforts to boost his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe cooperation of Flynn, who was a top campaign adviser before becoming Trump's national security adviser in the White House, would be a major asset in Mueller's investigation. In March, as he unsuccessfully sought immunity for his client to testify to House and Senate investigations into the issue, Kelner said, \"Mr. Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he certainly wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.\"\n\nTwo sources familiar with Mueller's investigation said Flynn may be able to provide insight into three major areas of inquiry. These are: any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 campaign; money laundering and other possible financial crimes by Trump aides; and whether Trump sought to obstruct justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey in May, as Comey was probing the Trump campaign's dealings with Russia.\n\nRussia has denied interfering in the election. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia by his campaign and has called the inquiry a witch hunt.\n\nTwo congressional officials involved in separate probes into the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia said one key area of investigation is whether Flynn or other advisers to Trump ever suggested U.S. economic sanctions on Russia could be lifted in exchange for favorable business deals.\n\nPossible deals include a proposed commercial nuclear power project involving Russian firms that Flynn in recent years worked to promote to potential clients in the Middle East, sources familiar with the project told sources.\n\n\"At this point, there is no evidence of an effort to negotiate that kind of deal, but Flynn is near the top of the list of people who probably would know if there was any such effort,\" said one of the congressional officials, also speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump fired Flynn on Feb. 13, after disclosures that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with then Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, the month before Trump took office, and later misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.\n\nFlynn has acknowledged contacts with Kislyak dating back to 2013, but beyond saying they covered a variety of subjects has said nothing about the content of their conversations during Trump's campaign and after his election.\n\nFlynn has been under scrutiny by the special counsel in a number of areas, sources familiar with the investigation have said. Mueller has been investigating whether Flynn knowingly made false statements to the government about his foreign travels, income, and contacts on his security clearance form.\n\nFlynn also has come under scrutiny for work on behalf of Russian clients, and over whether his work for a businessman with ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was lawful.\n\nMueller has been investigating Flynn's son, Michael Flynn Jr.'s, involvement in some of his father's business dealings in Russia, Turkey, and elsewhere, the sources said, and that could provide a potent additional incentive for Flynn to cooperate.\n\nBarry Coburn, a lawyer for Flynn's son, declined to comment.",
    " Title: Whistleblower's Lawyers Express Concern Over President Trump's Statements Regarding Identity\n\nArticle:\n\nThe legal team for the whistleblower whose complaint triggered a US presidential impeachment inquiry has expressed concern over President Donald Trump's statements that could potentially endanger their client. Since the transcript of his call with the president of Ukraine was revealed, Mr. Trump has called for the anonymous whistleblower to be unmasked.\n\nDemocrats have stated that the whistleblower will testify to Congress \"soon\" once steps are taken to protect their identity. Mr. Trump has suggested his opponents could be arrested for treason.\n\nA transcript of a call Mr. Trump made to Ukraine's new President Volodymyr Zelensky shows he urged him to investigate discredited corruption allegations against former vice-president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden as well as his son. The call is now at the center of an effort by Democrats that could see Mr. Trump expelled from office, but doing so would require members of his Republican party to turn against him.\n\nThe letter from the whistleblower's legal team, in which the lawyers call attention to Mr. Trump's language, was sent to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Saturday and made public on Sunday.\n\n\"The events of the past week have heightened our concerns that our client's identity will be disclosed publicly and that, as a result, our client will be put in harm's way,\" wrote lawyer Andrew Bakaj.\n\nThe letter specifically mentions Mr. Trump's call last week for the whistleblower to be identified, as well as the person that supplied the whistleblower with information about the call. It quotes Mr. Trump as saying: \"I want to know who's the person that gave the whistleblower, who's the person that gave the whistleblower the information, because that's close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.\"\n\nThe letter also references a $50,000 \"bounty\" that two conservative Trump supporters have offered as a \"reward\" for information about the whistleblower.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we expect this situation to worsen, and to become even more dangerous for our client and any other whistleblowers, as Congress seeks to investigate this matter,\" Mr. Bakaj's letter adds.\n\nMr. Maguire faced lawmakers last week and said he believed the whistleblower acted in \"good faith.\"\n\nImpeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict - unlikely in this case, given that Mr. Trump's party controls the chamber.\n\nOnly two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted and removed.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Mr. Trump retweeted a Fox News guest who warned that if Mr. Trump is removed from office, it will spark \"a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\" Illinois Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger condemned Mr. Trump's tweet as \"repugnant.\"\n\nIt came as part of a massive Twitter volley against his critics, in which Mr. Trump said he wanted to meet the whistleblower.\n\n\"I want to meet not only my accuser... but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the 'Whistleblower.' Was this person SPYING on the US President? Big Consequences!\"\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump resumed his Twitter campaign against the whistleblower, as well as Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who is playing a leading role in the inquiry and has been one of the most vocal critics of the US president.\n\n\"I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason,\" wrote Mr. Trump.\n\nOver the weekend, Republicans began to mount a campaign to defend Mr. Trump, however, some prominent Republican officials appeared to condemn Mr. Trump for this latest scandal. Tom Bossert, who served as Homeland Security Advisor under Mr. Trump, told ABC News: \"I'm deeply disturbed by it [the call] as well and this entire mess.\"\n\nDonald Trump is frequently at his most unfiltered over weekends - and this last one served as evidence in the extreme. Since Saturday morning, the president has fired off more than a hundred tweets and retweets, lashing out at Democrats in Congress, the media, his political critics, and even conservative Fox News.\n\nThe recently announced formal impeachment inquiry has become all-consuming for Mr. Trump - and is turning the man who likes to fashion himself as a \"counter-puncher\" into a whirling frenzy of fists. The risk for the president is the more he lashes out, the more it reminds the American public of what they see as Mr. Trump's greatest flaw. Polls consistently demonstrate a majority of Americans - on the left and the right - disapprove of the president's penchant for social media invective and the apparent lack of discipline it represents.\n\nIf a weekend spent on scorched-earth responses mark Mr. Trump's impeachment battle plan - with him tweeting the shots from his phone - it may make for a shaky defense and cause growing unease among Republicans who contemplate the challenges of campaigning for re-election under the president's banner in 2020.\n\nIn a complaint filed last month, a whistleblower from the intelligence community reported his \"urgent concern\" that the president had used his office to \"solicit interference from a foreign country\" in the 2020 US election. The impeachment inquiry launched on Tuesday now focuses specifically on Mr. Trump's call to the Ukrainian president about the Biden allegations.\n\nDemocrats accuse Mr. Trump of improperly seeking foreign help in the hope of smearing Mr. Biden and of using military aid as a bargaining tool. Ukrainian ex-prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko has told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate Mr. Biden or his son Hunter Biden, who had worked for a Ukrainian energy firm.\n\nDemocrats in Congress - which is currently in recess - say they plan to remain in Washington over the break to move \"expeditiously\" on with impeachment hearings and subpoenas. Lawmakers say in addition to the whistleblower, they also wish to speak with the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to co-ordinate with on an inquiry into the Bidens.",
    " Title: Gilead Sciences Announces Cost of Coronavirus Treatment Remdesivir\n\nArticle:\n\nGilead Sciences, a biopharmaceutical company, has announced the cost of its antiviral drug remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. In an open letter, Gilead Chairman and CEO Daniel O' Day revealed that the cost for COVID-19 patients covered by Medicare and the governments of developed countries will be $2,340, equating to approximately $390 per vial. For U.S. patients with private health insurance, the cost will be $3,120, or up to $5,720 for a longer duration of treatment.\n\nIn the letter, O' Day also confirmed that the company has entered into agreements with drug manufacturers capable of producing generic forms of the drug in developing countries. The company expects to begin charging in July.\n\nThe announcement comes amid scrutiny of remdesivir by doctors and medical experts. While the cost covers a five-day treatment course, a medical publication previously noted that remdesivir reduced recovery time by an average of four days based on a 10-day course of remdesivir.\n\nSome medical professionals have expressed concern about the cost compared to the benefits, with some arguing that clinical studies have not yet indicated whether there is a mortality benefit that can justify the cost.\n\nDr. Eugene Gu tweeted, \"Gilead Sciences charging $2,340 for a 5-day course of Remdesivir that maybe reduces time to recovery, doesn't improve survival, and is likely inferior to the much cheaper dexamethasone for ventilated patients reveals Big Pharma's greed and opportunism during this pandemic.\"\n\nJames Todaro, MD, tweeted, \"Remdesivir price is out now. As I suspected, it's not cheap. Gilead is charging hospitals between $3,120 and $5,720 per patient. Payment will begin in July, likely in anticipation of making a profit in the second wave of COVID-19. Lot of money for a drug with no mortality benefit.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that Gilead Sciences received a $37.5 million grant from the U.S. government to develop and test remdesivir. Additionally, Gilead projected 2020 revenue for Remdesivir to be $1 billion.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, a leading expert on infectious diseases, previously touted remdesivir as showing promise in the treatment of COVID-19.",
    " Title: Tariffs Reduce U.S. Manufacturing Employment and Increase Prices, According to Federal Reserve Study\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by two Federal Reserve economists suggests that the ongoing U.S.-China trade war has resulted in a reduction in U.S. manufacturing employment and increased prices for the materials manufacturers need. The study, which serves as a natural experiment by comparing trends across different industries, finds that the benefits from being protected from foreign competition are canceled out by the higher costs manufacturers incur due to tariffs.\n\nThe study, which breaks out the three main effects of the trade war, estimates its impacts on employment, production, and prices. The vertical lines in the charts represent the first and last phases of tariff hikes, and the shaded areas represent \"confidence intervals,\" meaning the trend lines are estimates, and the true values may lie elsewhere in the shaded areas.\n\nThe study finds that rising input costs decreased employment and increased producer prices, while foreign retaliation also decreased employment. On the positive side, import protection did seem to increase employment, though the effect is borderline in terms of statistical significance.\n\nComparing industries more exposed to each type of effect with those less exposed, the authors find that the former suffered a reduction in employment of 1.4 percent, with the positive contribution from the import protection effect of tariffs (0.3 percent) more than offset by the negative effects associated with rising input costs (-1.1 percent) and retaliatory tariffs (-0.7 percent). The same comparison for producer prices reveals a 4.1 percent increase.\n\nThe study's findings must be seen in the context of overall trends. American manufacturing employment was on the rise in 2017 and 2018, but it stalled thereafter, when the tariffs were in full effect. A policy meant to promote manufacturing work may have contributed to its stagnation instead.\n\nThe study has some limitations, including the possibility of other equally credible ways of analyzing the data, outright errors, and the fact that it only analyzes the trade war's short-term effects on American manufacturing. The authors also note that the increase in uncertainty generated by recent rounds of tariff increases may be one of the ways in which the effects of past policy persist.\n\nAside from the possibility the paper is just wrong, these limitations provide little comfort to the people who missed out on job opportunities thanks to protectionism.",
    " Title: Senate's \"Nuclear Option\" Likely to be Invoked in Gorsuch Confirmation Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Senate is expected to take a significant step in the confirmation process of President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, with at least 41 Democrats reportedly planning to block his nomination. This could potentially lead to the Republican-controlled Senate invoking the so-called \"nuclear option,\" a parliamentary maneuver that would eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees.\n\nThe filibuster, a procedural tactic that requires 60 votes to end debate and move forward with a vote, is a unique element in the U.S. Senate, which is the world's most deliberative body. However, the filibuster can be rewritten with a simple majority vote, and the 60-vote threshold is an illusion that has survived only due to a bipartisan, institutional belief in its importance.\n\nIf Democrats cannot secure 60 votes to end debate on Gorsuch's nomination, the Senate could face a filibuster, potentially stalling the confirmation process until Gorsuch is withdrawn. If this occurs, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) may trigger the \"nuclear option\" and abolish the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees.\n\nThe process to invoke the \"nuclear option\" would unfold as follows:\n\n1. The Senate will vote to invoke \"cloture,\" which ends debate on the issue at hand. Under Rule XXII, the Senate requires 60 votes to approve cloture and end a debate.\n2. If cloture fails, a Republican senator will move to reconsider the cloture motion. After it fails a second time, McConnell will raise a point of order declaring that all Supreme Court nominees can be approved with a simple majority vote.\n3. The Senate President pro tempore will rule on whether points of order are approved or overruled, based on Senate rules and precedent.\n4. If McConnell's point of order is overruled, he can appeal the ruling, which triggers an immediate vote on the Senate president's ruling.\n5. The vote on the Senate president's ruling is a simple majority vote. If a majority of the Senate votes \"nay\" on the interpretation of the Senate rules, a new precedent is set to guide future votes on U.S. Supreme Court nominees\u2014namely, a precedent saying cloture is not required.\n6. Democrats will likely appeal that vote, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) raising a point of order and asking the President pro tempore if cloture is required for U.S. Supreme Court nominees.\n7. The Senate President will cite the just-taken vote as a new Senate precedent that the threshold for approving Supreme Court nominees is a simple majority. He will overrule Schumer's point of order.\n8. Schumer can appeal this ruling and call for a vote on the Senate President's ruling. This triggers an immediate vote.\n9. The Republican majority will defeat Schumer's appeal, and the Senate President's interpretation of the rules (the new interpretation, which says only a simple majority is needed) will be confirmed.\n10. Finally, after all the parliamentary shenanigans, the Senate will return to the question of Gorsuch's nomination. With the new precedent in place, a simple majority vote will approve Gorsuch's nomination and make him the 113th member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Senate's confirmation process for Supreme Court nominees is often compared to the fictional sport Calvinball, a game played and invented by the characters Calvin and Hobbes in the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes. The game has a slew of complicated rules that are arbitrary and nutty, but any of the rules can be changed at any time, usually by any player. The Senate's rules operate in a similar manner, with the most important thing to know being that any of the rules can be changed at any time, usually by the players themselves.",
    " Title: Amazon Rainforest Fires: A Closer Look at the Data\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Amazon Rainforest fires have been a global concern, with numerous news outlets reporting unprecedented rates of burning due to human-induced global warming. Headlines such as \"Amazon rainforest burning at record rate\" (CNN) and \"The Amazon rainforest is burning. Be afraid\" (New York Daily News) have been common.\n\nHowever, a closer examination of the data reveals some issues with the information provided. The satellite fire data referenced only began in 2013, making six years of data insufficient for making \"record-breaking\" statements in any context. Furthermore, the satellite data collected was not intended to be used as a counting tool for the number of fires but rather as a readiness alert system to identify fires before they become uncontrollable.\n\nAccording to NASA's Global Fire Emissions Database, activity is above average in the states of Amazonas and Rondonia, but below average in Mato Grosso and Par\u00e1. The overall numbers are in line with historic data that goes back to 2003, providing a more accurate perspective on the fires.\n\nIt is essential to understand that the Amazon fire season begins in late July and peaks in mid-September, ending in November. Most fires are intentionally set due to the difficulty of starting and spreading fires in the damp rainforest. Ranchers have historically used fire to clear the forest, with up to 15% of the original forest cleared in the 1990s and 2000s before conservation efforts slowed the loss of forest.\n\nFires are rare during much of the year due to the wet nature of the climate. During the dry season, land that has already been cleared is typically burned periodically to regenerate and maintain farmland or pasture. Much of the fire being reported as the virgin tropical rainforest is existing grassland or farmland being regenerated using fire as a tool.\n\nThe Amazonian rainforest plays a crucial role in the global ecosystem, and conservation efforts have been effective in stemming the worst of deforestation abuses. The promotion of alarmist and false information misdirects the energies of people, including world leaders, and undermines trust in media and public institutions.\n\nGregory Wrightstone, the author of the book \"Inconvenient Facts: The Science That Al Gore Doesn't Want You to Know,\" is a geologist with over 35 years of experience researching and studying various aspects of the Earth's processes.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of \u2588\u2588\u2588.",
    " Title: Boy Scouts of America Renames Program, Remains at Odds with Girl Scouts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America (BSA) announced on Wednesday its decision to drop \"Boy\" from the name of its signature program, marking a significant shift in the organization's approach to inclusivity. This move comes amid ongoing competition with the Girl Scouts, as both organizations grapple with declining membership.\n\nThe BSA's decision, however, did not impress the Girl Scouts, which emphasized the lack of new, \"girl-specific\" programming in the BSA's offerings. Sylvia Acevedo, CEO of Girl Scouts of the USA, stated, \"Girl Scouts is the premier leadership development organization for girls. We are, and will remain, the first choice for girls and parents.\"\n\nThe BSA will retain its name, Boy Scouts of America or BSA, and the term \"Cub Scouts\" for children aged 7-10 will remain unchanged. The program for children aged 10-17, previously known as Boy Scouts, will become Scouts BSA in February.\n\nMike Surbaugh, the BSA's Chief Scout Executive, unveiled the group's \"Scout Me In\" marketing campaign, emphasizing inclusiveness. \"As we enter a new era for our organization, it is important that all youth can see themselves in Scouting in every way possible,\" Surbaugh said.\n\nIn October, the BSA announced it would provide programs for girls. In the months prior, the group announced it would accept and register transgender youths into its organization.\n\nStarting this summer, Cub Scouts will formally accept girls. Over 3,000 girls nationwide have already enrolled in the BSA\u2019s Early Adopter Program and are participating in Cub Scouts before the full launch.\n\nThe BSA argues that allowing girls into the organization allows busy families to consolidate programs for their children. Most of the actual Cub packs and Scout troops, however, will remain single-gender. Girls and boys can work toward the prestigious title of Eagle Scout.\n\nThe BSA claims almost 2.3 million members, down from 2.6 million five years ago. This includes Venturing and Sea Scouting programs, the latter allowing membership up to 21 years of age. In its peak years, BSA had over 4 million participants.\n\nAdults play a major role in the program, with almost 1 million adult volunteers serving as the backbone of the organization.\n\nThe impact of the BSA's aggressive recruitment effort on the Girl Scouts is yet to be determined. The Girl Scouts, best known for its lucrative annual cookie sales, currently claims a membership of about 1.8 million.\n\nThe Girl Scouts have listed a series of efforts aimed at \"staying ahead of the pack of youth organizations.\" This includes 23 new merit badges focusing on outdoors and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math), and last month, the organization unveiled a LinkedIn network aimed at tapping a major resource\u2014the group's 50 million alums.\n\nThe goal of the network is \"to support female advancement in the workforce and help prepare girls for a lifetime of leadership and career success.\"\n\nHowever, the impact of the BSA's effort is already being felt. Fiona Cummings, a regional leader of Girl Scouts of Northern Illinois, told the Associated Press that the BSA's decision to admit girls is among the factors that have shrunk her council's youth membership by over 500 girls so far this year.\n\nShe stated, \"How do you manage these strategic tensions?\" She continued, \"We both need to increase our membership numbers.\"",
    " Title: Clinton's Ties to For-Profit University Laureate Raise Questions Amid Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, during her campaign trail, has been a vocal critic of for-profit universities, accusing them of charging high prices and offering little support, while delivering degrees of questionable value. However, her administration, she says, would crack down on for-profit colleges and loan servicers who have allegedly taken advantage of borrowers.\n\nWhat is not mentioned in Clinton's campaign speeches are her close family connections to for-profit Laureate Education and the substantial $9.8 billion in loans accumulated by students at Laureate's Walden University in Minnesota. This is according to a Brookings Institution study from last year, making Walden University the second-most indebted U.S. college, trailing only the University of Phoenix.\n\nIf Clinton wonders why many voters consider her to be graspy and question her trustworthiness, she need look no further than the tangled, lucrative ties among Laureate, its owners, the Clinton family, and the Clinton Foundation. From 2010 until just two weeks before Clinton launched her presidential campaign last year, the private company paid Bill Clinton $17.6 million as the honorary chancellor, a role that involved offering advice to Laureate executives and speaking to students at some of the school's dozens of campuses around the world.\n\nIn addition, since 2007, Laureate and its major investors and financiers\u2014including Goldman Sachs, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., SAC Capital, and CitiGroup Private Equity\u2014have donated millions more to the Clinton Foundation, Clinton's two presidential campaigns, and related organizations, as well as speaking fees to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, including $900,000 from Goldman and KKR for four appearances by Hillary Clinton in 2013 alone.\n\nHaving a former president, and spouse of a sitting secretary of State, become Laureate's public face burnished its reputation as it went on a debt-fueled global buying spree, acquiring dozens of colleges from Latin America to Asia. And having muscular contacts among the global foreign policy elite is helpful in fending off more government regulation in the nearly 30 countries where Baltimore-based Laureate operates.\n\nRobert Zoellick, a former World Bank president and deputy secretary of State, is on the board, and George W. Bush's secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, is a paid adviser to Laureate who has given speeches on its campuses as far away as China. When Clinton stepped down, Laureate replaced him with a former president of Mexico.\n\nEven as Laureate, which has had net losses totaling $563.4 million in its past three fiscal years and $102.4 million in the first quarter of this year, presents itself as a \"public benefit corporation\"\u2014a hybrid of profit-seeking capitalism and high-minded do-gooderism\u2014some of its business practices dance close to ethical red lines.\n\nOutside the USA, for example, Laureate pays recruiters legal \"commissions\" for getting students to enroll in its schools\u2014a practice Congress banned in the U.S. because it encouraged for-profit schools to enroll students and harvest their loan money with little regard to whether they graduated and were able to pay back their loans.\n\nAt Walden, Laureate's largest American campus, loan default rates are lower than the national average. However, according to the U.S. Department of Education, three years after undergraduates leave Walden, 56% have yet to repay a single dollar on their loans compared with 33% nationwide.\n\nIn any other election, the Clintons' ties to Laureate Education would likely receive more attention. In this contest, though, the Democratic presidential nominee is fortunate that her Republican opponent happens to be the founder of Trump University, an operation that makes Laureate look like Harvard.",
    " Title: Millennial Voter Turnout Remains Low Despite Increased Political Awareness\n\nArticle:\n\nMillennial voters are attracting less attention from politicians in the current election cycle due to low expectations for their turnout. In the 2010 midterm election, only 25% of voters aged 18 to 29 cast their ballots, and this year, the projected turnout for voters under 30 is even lower at 23%. These figures are according to Eva Guidarini of the Harvard Institute of Politics, which studies young voters.\n\nThe organization Rock the Vote, which was established in 1989 to engage young voters through music stars like Madonna, continues its efforts with a modernized approach. The group's latest video message features rapper Lil Jon.\n\nHistorically, young voter participation among millennials had been on the rise, with a peak of 52% in 2008. However, in 2012, the turnout among voters aged 18 to 29 dropped to 45%. Additionally, the percentage of young voters who were registered to vote also decreased after 2008, according to the Pew Research Center. By 2012, it reached 50%, the lowest number recorded by Pew since 1996.\n\nSome attribute the drop in young voter turnout to the disillusionment with the political process. Jacob Bell, a 20-year-old student at the University of Maryland, stated, \"I can pull up Facebook in front of me and see five different articles about the next Senate race, and that's something that I know my mom's generation never had.\"\n\nAshley Spillane, the president of Rock the Vote, believes that the low turnout among young voters is a result of the current political climate. \"Politics right now is really disheartening,\" she said. \"I think it's why you see in the polls that young people are not affiliating with political parties.\"\n\nHowever, Spillane also emphasized that millennials are passionate about issues that matter to them and are actively involved in their communities. \"They are getting involved at a local level. They are creating startups. They are volunteering with local organizations. They are looking to take problems on in real time and fix them,\" she said.\n\nThe challenge for Rock the Vote is reaching a generation that is politically aware but disillusioned with the current political climate. Eva Guidarini expressed concern about a generation of voters being turned off by politics as they are forming their political identities, but she remains hopeful. \"I think that if politics starts to change in a direction that I think all of America wants to see it change \u2014 not just young people \u2014 then you'll see young people get back in the game,\" she said.\n\nThe question remains whether politics will improve unless a new generation gets more involved and pushes for change. The use of the hashtag #newboom on social media is encouraged to join the conversation about millennial voters.",
    " Title: Sanders Suspends Lawsuit Against DNC, Maintains Case Open for Future Action\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders, an independent running for the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) presidential nomination, has announced that he will not actively pursue his lawsuit against the DNC over access to voter data files, but has kept the case open as a precautionary measure. The decision comes after DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz suspended Sanders' access to the party's voter files last month, alleging that his staff had exploited a computer breakdown to access rival presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's files on the DNC's system.\n\nSanders apologized for his staff's behavior and initiated an investigation into the wrongdoing. However, he argued that Ms. Wasserman Schultz had no authority to immediately suspend his own access, which is essential for his campaign to develop a strategy for targeting voters in the primaries and caucuses.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by Sanders, claimed that the DNC had breached his contract for data access. After the lawsuit, Ms. Wasserman Schultz relented. The case had been inactive, with Sanders never serving papers on the DNC, until Judge Tanya S. Chutkan demanded clarity on Sanders' intentions earlier this week.\n\nGarvey Schubert Barer, Sanders' lawyer, stated that the parties are engaged in discussions and are cooperating to resolve the litigation. The lawyer added that, \"The parties are engaged in discussions and are continuing in their cooperative efforts to resolve the pending litigation. In light of these efforts, plaintiff does not intend to serve defendant at this time. However, if the parties are unable to resolve this dispute, plaintiff reserves the right to serve defendant before the expiration of the time limit for service.\"\n\nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure grant Sanders up to 90 days to serve notice of his complaint on the DNC. Clinton's campaign has claimed to have been victimized by Sanders, but Sanders has countered that he had alerted the DNC to problems with its system security earlier last year, and the party had ignored him.\n\nLiberal activists have criticized Ms. Wasserman Schultz for suspending Sanders' access to the voter files, arguing that it could potentially favor Clinton in the primaries.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Calls for Stronger U.S. Response to Russian Aggression in Ukraine\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech delivered in Berlin on Tuesday, former Governor Jeb Bush, a potential Republican presidential candidate, called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to cease his actions in Ukraine and Eastern Europe. Bush stated that if elected president, the United States would take a harder line on Russian aggression.\n\nBush emphasized the importance of respecting the sovereignty of all neighbors and questioned the effectiveness of allowing Russia to act without consequences. He stated, \"Our alliance, our solidarity, and our actions are essential if we want to preserve the fundamental principles of our international order... an order that free nations have sacrificed so much to build.\"\n\nThe Russian president has denied sending troops into Ukraine, but satellite images suggest otherwise. Bush accused Putin of supporting separatists in their battle against pro-independence forces and urged him to halt his efforts to reintegrate Ukraine into the Russian sphere of influence.\n\nBush expressed concern over the unfolding situation in Ukraine, stating, \"Who will say otherwise, as we watch the fate of Ukraine, slowly unfold in tragedy? Ukraine, a sovereign European nation, must be permitted to choose its own path.\"\n\nBush supports economic sanctions on Russia and has advocated for delivering some U.S. military equipment to Ukraine. His remarks follow President Obama's comments made on Monday during his visit to the G-7 in Kr\u00fcn, Germany, where Obama also expressed support for continuing sanctions and urged Putin to seek compromise.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin has vowed to uphold a Cold War-era nuclear treaty, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia has no intention of breaking the treaty. The U.S. has accused Russia of testing a ground-launched cruise missile in violation of the treaty, while Russia has countered that some elements of the U.S. missile defense shield violate the same treaty.\n\nDuring his speech, Bush also addressed economic issues, emphasizing the importance of economic freedom and the need for modern, transparent, and fair standards and rules in global markets. He also spoke about the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and the relevance of the U.S.-European alliance.\n\nBush is scheduled to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday at the conference of the economic council of the Christian Democratic Union, the political party Merkel leads. Both leaders are delivering speeches at the event.",
    " Title: Tech Giants Face Intense Scrutiny on Capitol Hill, Remain Unscathed in Stock Market\n\nArticle:\n\nTech giants Facebook, Alphabet (Google), Apple, and Amazon faced a day of intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill this week, with the industry's Big Four being placed under the microscope of three different Congressional hearings. Despite the harsh criticism and accusations of anti-conservative bias on Alphabet's Google search and concerns about Facebook's proposed digital currency, the companies' stocks remained largely unchanged, underscoring their continued market dominance and strong financial performance.\n\nFacebook's stock (FB) was flat at $203.84, Alphabet's GOOGL and GOOG shares were up slightly to $1,153.46, Apple's AAPL stock was flat at $204.50, and Amazon's AMZN stock was down 0.5% to $2,007.90. The quartet has a cumulative market valuation of over $3 trillion.\n\nWhile the government, consumers, and privacy advocates may be concerned about the influence of Big Tech in their lives, investors do not seem to share these concerns. Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst who covers Facebook at FBN Securities, stated in a phone interview that as long as advertisers get high returns on Facebook, which is the largest platform in town, there is no need to look elsewhere. He assessed the one-year high in Facebook's stock price, stating that an antitrust investigation will take years, and legislation a while. Facebook is in no immediate trouble, according to Seyrafi.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives believes the current clash between the Beltway and Big Tech is \"more bark than bite\" that will likely result in tweaks to business models and potential fines rather than forced company breakups. Ives also believes the clash could act as a catalyst for \"more technology innovation/diversification over the coming years for these titans,\" as the DoJ case against Microsoft proved to be.\n\nHowever, representatives from all four companies took their share of criticism during the hearings, with Facebook's digital currency project, called Libra, facing withering skepticism over regulatory and trust issues. Apple, Amazon, and Google also faced criticism for user-data transgressions or restrictive business practices. Apple is being challenged in a class-action lawsuit over its management of its App Store, and Google withstood a barrage of criticism from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during the Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on \"Google and Censorship through Search Engines.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) stated in the Google-search hearing, \"The hourglass has run out on regulation and tech. Big Tech is in a perfect storm.\" Karan Bhatia, Google's vice president of public policy and a former senior official in the George W. Bush administration, was also criticized by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) for the company's business dealings in China. Amazon was repeatedly questioned on its growing impact in the retail industry and its impact on smaller merchants.\n\nThe hearings made for an unrelenting assault on companies that rarely find themselves in defensive postures. However, they might get used to the feeling, if Tuesday was any indication. And more is on the horizon, with potential antitrust investigations of all four companies by either the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission.\n\nStanford law professor Doug Melamed told \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"Everybody wants to take a swipe at Big Tech these days. But the stock market seems to be ignoring all that is happening out of Washington, except for the Fed.\"",
    " Title: President Obama's Perceived Failures: A Recap of His Self-Assessed Shortcomings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews this year, President Barack Obama has been asked about his biggest failure during his first term and has provided three different answers. The president admitted that he has not been successful in establishing a consistent focus on problem-solving and bipartisan cooperation, as he initially intended.\n\nDuring an interview with Univision's Jorge Ramos, Obama identified the lack of comprehensive immigration reform as his most significant failure. He emphasized that this issue would continue to be a priority for his administration.\n\nIn a conversation with CBS News' Charlie Rose, Obama stated that his mistake during the first couple of years of his term was thinking that the presidency was solely about getting policy right. He acknowledged that the role also requires telling a story that instills unity, purpose, and optimism among the American people, particularly during challenging economic times.\n\nIn summary, President Obama's self-assessed \"biggest\" failures are failing to tell enough stories, not changing the tone in Washington, and not achieving comprehensive immigration reform (despite having a supermajority of Democrats during his first two years in office). The president did not mention the economy or job creation as his biggest failures.\n\nIt is worth noting that President Obama has a reputation for being inconsistent, as he has given different answers about his biggest failure, claimed not to have raised taxes, and described nearly everything as a top priority.",
    " Title: American Political Polarization Reaches Record High, Shaping 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to a report by the Pew Research Centre, American voters are more polarized than ever, with the number of Americans expressing consistently conservative or liberal opinions having doubled over the past two decades. This increasing level of partisanship has become evident in various ways, including the rise of the Tea Party, a grassroots conservative movement, and the government shutdown of 2013.\n\nThe polarization is particularly noticeable in the campaign platforms and actions of both the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates. For instance, Republican candidate Mike Huckabee suggested using the American military to prevent women from getting abortions, an issue that is generally considered controversial in the general election. On the left, Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, is gaining traction and is trailing behind Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in many political polls.\n\nThe rise of partisan politics is attributed to the fact that these political divisions are greatest among those who are more politically active. The Pew Research Report states that the majority of Americans do not have uniformly conservative or liberal views, but the most ideologically oriented and politically rancorous Americans make their voices heard through greater participation in every stage of the political process.\n\nThe 2008 recession, which coincided with other issues such as the need to deal with the effects of climate change and the US losing its position as the dominant geo-political entity on the world stage, has motivated many Americans, especially those who were most affected, to push for political change in all directions. The emergence of increasing partisanship and the vocal minorities behind it could be seen as the resurgence of political experimentation in a time of great uncertainty.\n\nIn addition to candidates polarizing their party's basic platform, there are also those who are addressing issues generally considered peripheral to the party's concern or opposed to the basic principles of their party. This is best exemplified by 2008 presidential candidate Ron Paul, whose libertarian principles brought him into conflict with fellow Republicans on numerous occasions. The popularity of such \"mixed\" platforms, that are not generically conservative or liberal, has ironically increased in tandem with the increased polarization of American politics. The interest in more nontraditional and innovative politics can also be seen in the increased interest in US third parties. According to a recent Gallup poll, six to ten Americans now believe a third party is needed. During the 2012 election, the Free and Equal Elections Foundation sponsored a televised third party presidential debate in protest of their exclusion from mainstream political debates.\n\nThe US may be primed for dramatic political change that goes beyond the mere polarization or radicalization of basic party principles. The unbridled economic growth and stability of the 1990s and early 2000s have dissipated, and Americans are striving to reconcile themselves with that fact. This polarization of American politics could be seen as giving way to a widening of the ideological spectrum, which can be seen through the increasing popularity of libertarian platforms within the Republican Party and growing interest in US third parties. Hopefully, these misfit candidates or new political parties will emerge and possibly fill the gap between the partisan extremes.",
    " Title: Michelle Snyder, Chief Operating Officer of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Retires\n\nArticle:\n\nMichelle Snyder, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), is retiring at the end of 2013, according to a statement by CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner on Monday. Snyder oversaw the development and debut of HealthCare.gov, the federal Obamacare website that experienced significant issues in October and November before its turnaround by early December.\n\nTavenner announced Snyder's retirement, stating, \"I regret to announce that, after 41 years of outstanding public service, CMS Chief Operating Officer Michelle Snyder is retiring at the end of 2013.\" Tavenner further expressed her appreciation for Snyder's contributions, acknowledging her as a \"good friend and a key member of the agency\u2019s leadership team.\"\n\nSnyder had initially planned to retire at the end of 2012, but she chose to stay on to assist with the challenges facing CMS in 2013. Tim Love, Snyder's deputy, will serve as the acting COO.\n\nSnyder's departure marks the second high-level exit from CMS since the problematic debut of the Obamacare insurance markets on October 1, 2013. The agency's chief information officer, Tony Trenkle, left in November for a position in the private sector.\n\nIn November, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius identified Snyder as a key person responsible for the HealthCare.gov project.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa, California Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, offered some parting remarks for Snyder, stating that she approved the launch of the troubled Obamacare website despite security concerns. Issa claimed that documents and interviews indicated Snyder bypassed the recommendation of CMS' top security expert who suggested delaying the launch of HealthCare.gov due to serious security vulnerabilities resulting from inadequate security testing. Issa added that Americans seeking health insurance are left to bear the risk of a website that is still a work in progress due to the \"cult-like commitment\" of officials to launching on October 1, 2013.",
    " Title: New Health Law Offers Assistance to Those with Employer-Provided Insurance\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, often associated with providing health insurance to the uninsured, could also offer assistance to individuals and families with employer-provided insurance. This is particularly relevant for those facing high premiums or inadequate coverage.\n\nRori Callaway and her family, residents of Dallas, experienced a significant increase in their health insurance premiums from their public school teaching job. The family's monthly premium for the cheapest plan available during open enrollment is now $760, a 30% increase.\n\nThe law provides new protections for those with employer-provided health insurance. It could help families like the Callaways, who may find relief through state and federally run health insurance exchanges, especially if their plans are deemed unaffordable.\n\nHowever, the path to relief is complex due to a glitch in the law's wording. The law refers only to the portion an individual's premium contributes to the household income, not the family's premium. This was intended to prevent people from leaving workplace plans for subsidized coverage through the exchanges. However, it may result in some families going without affordable coverage.\n\nThe individual's premium is not supposed to exceed 9.5% of the household income. The Callaways' family premium is now almost double that.\n\nFamilies like the Callaways could still shop on the new exchanges but would not be eligible for subsidies or tax credits, as these are only available to those who cannot afford coverage. If the plans become unaffordable for the first time outside of a typical fall-to-fall plan year, they may qualify for a special enrollment opportunity.\n\nFor help calculating whether a policy would be considered affordable under the law, consult your state exchange or call one of the navigators for assistance. Get linked to your state's exchange and search for navigators there at the federal government's HealthCare.gov.\n\nHere are other ways the plans you buy during open enrollment will be different:\n\n1. Essential benefits: Everyone's plan, whether obtained on the exchanges or through an employer, must cover certain essential health benefits, including maternity care, prescription drugs, in-patient hospital care, and lab services.\n\n2. Preventive health care: Doctor or lab visits for procedures such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and blood pressure screening have to be covered in full now, with no co-pays and no cost-sharing allowed.\n\n3. Pre-existing conditions: People with pre-existing conditions trying to buy insurance individually have, until now, sometimes been denied coverage. Those with insurance provided by their employers are sometimes subject to waiting periods that can be as long as 12 months. Employees can no longer be subject to any pre-existing condition waiting period.\n\n4. Out of your pocket: Sometimes premiums go up at open enrollment time, but often it's also your co-payments and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. So even if you did not get good news in your open enrollment package about the money you must spend before insurance kicks in, there's a related perk in the law. Your co-payments now count toward your maximum out-of-pocket expenses, so you'll get there faster in 2014.\n\nRori Callaway, a freelance writer who also makes notebooks and journals she sells online, may look for seasonal retail work this holiday season. The family is also going to start selling some of their household items on Craigslist to make ends meet and pay up to the $4,800 deductible on their plan.\n\n\"The timing is certainly unfortunate,\" Callaway says of her new plan that took effect a month before the exchanges open. \"Surely there will be better options for our family out there with the new health care exchanges. I'm looking for that silver lining.\"",
    " Title: Cross-Party MPs Introduce Bill to Prevent No-Deal Brexit\n\nArticle:\n\nA cross-party group of Members of Parliament (MPs) has presented a bill aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit in ten days. If passed into law, the bill would require the Prime Minister to request an extension of Article 50, the European Union (EU) exit clause, beyond the current April 12 deadline. Labour MP Yvette Cooper introduced the bill, which supporters hope can pass through the House of Commons in a single day.\n\nThe Prime Minister is expected to make a statement shortly. The development comes after the cabinet, which remains divided over Brexit, met for eight hours at 10 Downing Street. The BBC's John Pienaar reported that Theresa May's ministers discussed plans to \"ramp up\" no-deal Brexit preparations and a snap general election was also discussed.\n\nMs. Cooper's bill would make it UK law for the Prime Minister to request an extension to prevent a no-deal Brexit, but it would be up to the EU to grant it or not. In March, MPs voted against leaving the EU without a deal, but the vote was not legally binding. Meanwhile, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, stated that a no-deal Brexit is now more likely but can still be avoided.\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar are meeting in Paris to discuss the impact of Brexit. President Macron told reporters that the EU \"cannot be hostage to the political crisis in the UK\" and the government must come forward with \"credible\" reasons for an extension. He suggested these could include an election, second referendum, or alternative proposals for the future relationship, such as a customs union.\n\nMr. Varadkar stated that the UK is \"consumed by Brexit,\" but the EU should not be. He added that the EU \"needs to be open\" about any proposals the UK brings, including a longer extension, and they will do what they can to \"assist.\" However, he noted that, as things stand, the UK will leave the EU on April 12 without a deal.\n\nTory MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who supports Ms. Cooper's bill, said, \"This is a last-ditch attempt to prevent our country being exposed to the risks inherent in a no-deal exit. 'We realize this is difficult. But it is definitely worth trying.'\" Ms. Cooper stated that the UK is \"in a very dangerous situation\" and MPs \"have a responsibility to make sure we do not end up with a catastrophic no-deal Brexit.\"\n\nNormally, the government chooses which bills to present to Parliament in order for them to become law. However, due to a vote by MPs, backbenchers will be in charge of business in the Commons on Wednesday. This gives backbenchers the opportunity to table their own bills, such as this one from Yvette Cooper. A copy of the bill shows that they want to push it through the Commons in one day. As the backbenchers will be in charge, they will also be able to vote to set aside more time on another day, if they need to complete the process or hold further indicative votes.\n\nHowever, the bill would also have to be agreed by the House of Lords and receive Royal Assent before it becomes law, which, if the Commons agrees it on Wednesday, could happen as soon as Thursday. Brexiteer Tory Sir Bill Cash stated that trying to go through these stages in one day made it a \"reprehensible procedure.\" However, Speaker John Bercow said that, while it was \"an unusual state of affairs,\" it was \"not as unprecedented as he supposes\" - citing recent bills on Northern Ireland that have been passed at the same speed.\n\nIn the latest round of indicative votes on Monday, MPs voted on four alternatives to the Prime Minister's withdrawal deal, but none gained a majority. MPs rejected a customs union with the EU by three votes. A motion for another referendum got the most votes in favor, but still lost. The votes were not legally binding, but they had been billed as the moment when Parliament might finally compromise.\n\nIndependent MP Chris Leslie tweeted that MPs would be seeking more time for indicative votes to take place on Monday. Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb stated he is considering resigning the whip after his party refused to back proposals for a customs union and Common Market 2.0 on Monday. He told \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"If you are seen to be unreasonable, not engaging to find solutions, I don't think it is very attractive to the people.\"\n\nEarlier, Mr. Barnier stated, \"No deal was never our desire or intended scenario, but the EU 27 is now prepared. It becomes day after day more likely.\" Mrs. May's plan for the UK's departure has been rejected by MPs three times.

    " Title: Rolling Stone's \"A Rape on Campus\" Story Faces Questions, Highlighting Ethical Responsibilities in Reporting Traumatic Events\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Rolling Stone magazine's high-profile story titled \"A Rape on Campus\" is facing scrutiny following serious questions about the accuracy of a horrifying alleged gang-rape incident that served as the story's central example.\n\nThe story, which began with a narrative from a young woman identified only as \"Jackie,\" detailed a gang rape that she claimed occurred at a fraternity party. In a statement today, Rolling Stone admitted \"discrepancies\" in Jackie's account and concluded that their trust in her was misplaced.\n\nThis story should serve as a reminder of the challenges in accurately reporting on traumatic events and the heightened ethical responsibilities that fall on journalists who do so.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the fraternity where Jackie said the attack took place did not host a party on the night Jackie claimed she was raped, and no member of the house fits Jackie's description of her assailant.\n\nReporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely did not fully verify the details of Jackie's story before publishing it or contact the alleged perpetrators involved. The Washington Post's report also states that the fraternity in question was not active during the time the alleged incident occurred.\n\nErdely claimed she was trying to protect Jackie, who feared retribution if Rolling Stone contacted her attackers. However, failing to ensure the story's accuracy before exposing it to public scrutiny did not protect Jackie; it left her vulnerable.\n\nThe problem, as the author of this article, a former lawyer who worked with trauma victims, points out, is not that people are making up stories, but that the details that seem important to journalists may not matter to the traumatized individuals.\n\nIn severe cases, post-traumatic stress disorder can cause memory loss or make the true details of stories too painful to recount. In less severe cases, people's stories often contain errors or omissions.\n\nBefore I had experience working with trauma victims, I would have scoffed at the idea that anyone could make such mistakes. But now I can easily believe it. By failing to check Jackie's story, Rolling Stone and Erdely were not protecting her; they were leaving her vulnerable. That was wrong and irresponsible, not just toward the alleged perpetrators, but toward their readers and Jackie herself.\n\nIt is unclear at this time whether any part of Jackie's story is true. The author did not speak to Jackie. It is possible that the entire story is a lie, or that some parts are true but Jackie intentionally changed some details for reasons of her own. If so, then she bears responsibility for that decision. However, it also seems possible that Jackie could be in a similar situation as the people the author worked with in the past, who were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which can affect memory and make it more difficult to retell a story accurately.\n\nThis incident underscores the importance of ethical journalism, particularly when reporting on traumatic events. Journalists have a responsibility to verify the details of a story before publishing it, to protect the individuals involved and maintain the credibility of their reporting.",
    " Title: Avaaz Launches Global Campaign to Mobilize U.S. Voters Abroad Ahead of Election\n\nArticle:\n\nA global campaign, dubbed the \"October surprise that will end Trump,\" has been launched in an attempt to mobilize a \"secret swing state\" of more than 8 million mostly unregistered \"global citizens\" and \"progressive\" Americans living abroad to vote in the U.S. election. The initiative was unveiled in London, United Kingdom, on Wednesday by Avaaz, a registered U.S. charity and one of the world's largest and most powerful activist groups.\n\nCampaigners, who were heard chanting \"Don't Vote Trump\" and \"Vote for Hillary\" during the demonstration, claim that the untapped voting block of Americans abroad is more likely to be \"progressive\" due to their educational backgrounds and political leanings. Avaaz points out that 56% of U.S. citizens living in the UK have master's degrees and overwhelmingly donated to Democratic candidates in the last three presidential primaries.\n\nThe campaign, which has been framed as anti-Trump, has been met with controversy as it is illegal for registered U.S. charities to work with or for presidential candidates. A spokeswoman for Avaaz denied any connection to the Hillary campaign when questioned. However, campaigners with Avaaz were recorded shouting \"Vote for Hillary\" during the demonstration.\n\nAvaaz claims to have enlisted over 30 million people worldwide to share a new tool that enables left-wing American expats to register to vote quickly and en masse. The 8 million Americans abroad almost never vote, and Avaaz argues that the new tool can help increase voter turnout.\n\n\"Avaaz has created the world's first, global, citizen's get-out-the-vote drive,\" said Meredith Alexander, the Campaigns Director for Avaaz. \"The more people that share it on Facebook, the more Americans abroad will see it, and the more we will be able to stop the global threat of Trump.\"\n\nThe group chose London for the launch as the UK has the \"largest concentration of US expats outside of North America.\" At the event, several Americans registered to vote before the media to prove how easy it is with Avaaz's new tool.\n\n\"For months, the world has sat on the sidelines, horrified by Trump's hate. Now, global citizens have a way to fight back,\" said Emma Ruby-Sachs, Deputy Director of Avaaz.\n\nAvaaz's website encourages people to email potential U.S. voters in other countries, giving them a template that reads: \"8 million Americans abroad could defeat Trump... if they vote! I wanted to make sure you saw this new overseas registration tool that makes voting dead-easy. It literally takes a few minutes : )\"\n\nThe official campaign makes no mention of other presidential candidates and is framed as simply anti-Trump. Banners on the bus today insisted the campaign is \"not authorized by any candidate or candidate office\" and linked to Avaaz.org/VoteAbroad, an unintentionally close sound to 'Voter Fraud,' an issue which campaigners will be keen to avoid discussion of.\n\n\"We are a charity in the United States, we are governed by American law, and we are not allowed to coordinate with any candidate,\" said Ms. Alexander. \"But, we are absolutely allowed to advocate for our position.\"\n\nHer argument was that Avaaz was not working for Hillary, which would be illegal, but was instead dedicated to issues like climate change and opposing nuclear weapons, and therefore must oppose Mr. Trump and his policies, which implicitly means backing Hillary.\n\nAvaaz launched in 2007 to agitate for various left-wing causes including animal rights and mass migration. They organized the biggest climate change march in the UK's history and have been described by the Guardian as \"the globe's largest and most powerful online activist network.\"\n\nThey claim to be \"independent and accountable\" and \"wholly member-funded.\" However, Avaaz was formed by the merger of several establishment groups including MoveOn.org, a group that received $1.46 million from George Soros during the 2004 election cycle, and Res Publica, which has received grants totalling $250,000 from the liberal billionaire's Open Society group.\n\nFurthermore, Avaaz co-founder Ricken Patel has worked for, either directly or as a consultant, numerous globalist foundations and corporations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Gates Foundation. According to POLITICO, Mr. Soros has committed around $25 million to assisting Hillary Clinton and Democratic Party causes at this election cycle.\n\nAvaaz also campaigned against the UK leaving the European Union under the banner: \"Choose Love, Vote Remain.\" Meredith Alexander said, \"Avaaz is just as strongly in support of trying to stop Brexit as we are of trying to stop Trump\" and that it is \"part of the same challenge\" of suppressing populist, anti-globalist movements.\n\n\"You have forces of division that are rising in a number of countries, whether it's here with Brexit... the Austrian presidential election, or the American presidential election. The threats that we are facing right now tend to be threats that need global coordination,\" she said, mentioning the \"refugee crisis\" and the \"climate crisis.\"\n\nMs. Alexander also praised London's Muslim Mayor, Sadiq Khan, for touring America to give his endorsement to Hillary Clinton. She said, \"I absolutely hope that he has an effect.\"",
    " Title: Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro Declared Winner of Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nBrazil's Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced on Sunday that Jair Bolsonaro, a controversial congressman known for his right-wing positions and sometimes extreme views, has won the country's presidential election. With 96 percent of ballots counted, Bolsonaro secured 55.5 percent of the votes, while leftist Fernando Haddad of the Workers' Party received 44.5 percent.\n\nBolsonaro, who has a 27-year career in Congress, positioned himself as a political outsider but gained prominence by mixing tough, often violent rhetoric with right-wing positions. His campaign initially gained traction with promises to address violent crime in a country that leads the world in homicides. However, his vows to loosen gun laws and give police a freer hand to use force against suspects have raised concerns about a potential bloody crackdown and erosion of civil rights.\n\nBolsonaro's campaign also won over much of the business community with promises of enacting market-friendly reforms that would reduce the size of the Brazilian state, including cutting ministries and privatizing state companies.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Jose Dias Toffoli, read out part of the Constitution to reporters after he voted, emphasizing the need for the future president to respect institutions, democracy, the rule of law, the judiciary branch, the national Congress, and the legislative branch.\n\nVoters in Sunday's runoff election appeared to look past warnings that Bolsonaro could erode democracy and embraced a chance for radical change after years of turmoil. Supporters of Bolsonaro celebrated in cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, with fireworks, car horns, and crowds gathering with banners and flags. Riot police separated supporters of Bolsonaro and those of his leftist rival Haddad when they briefly scuffled in Sao Paulo.\n\nBolsonaro went into the election the clear front-runner after getting 46 percent of the votes to Haddad's 29 percent in the first round of the election on October 7. After opinion polls in recent weeks had Bolsonaro leading by as much as 18 percentage points, the race had tightened in recent days, but Haddad was unable to make up the difference.\n\n\"I'm not crazy about Bolsonaro. But he is our way to keep the Workers' Party out of office,\" said Rafaela Rosa, a 32-year-old teacher, after voting Sunday in Sao Paulo. \"We have had enough corruption and now we need to clean up.\"",
    " Title: Akin Huddles with Conservative Leaders in Tampa as He Weighs Senate Bid Amidst Pressure\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Todd Akin (R-MO) is currently in Tampa, Florida, where he is meeting with top conservative activists at the Council For National Policy (CNP) summit to discuss his embattled Senate bid. The meetings come as Akin faces pressure from Republican heavyweights in Washington to abandon his campaign following his controversial comments about rape and pregnancy.\n\nAkin spent Wednesday night and Thursday in a series of private meetings at the two-day conference, which is being held before next week's Republican National Convention in Tampa. The congressman was scheduled to attend the conference before his comments about \"legitimate rape\" caused a stir in the Republican Party and shifted the focus of the presidential race towards the divisive social issue of abortion.\n\nMultiple sources at the CNP conference told CNN that Akin is being encouraged by leading figures in the conservative movement to remain in the Senate race despite the pressure from the Republican establishment. However, several activists and conservative thought leaders acknowledged the long odds Akin faces, with one person attending the summit saying many were \"spooked\" by a poll showing Akin trailing Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill by 10 points.\n\nA source close to Akin told CNN that the congressman is \"keeping an open ear to those people who are pushing him or questioning him on viability.\" However, the source stressed that Akin is \"getting a ton of support\" from conservatives at the conference.\n\nSeveral conservatives attending the conference expressed resentment at the aggressive and heavy-handed treatment of Akin by Republican leaders in Washington who have pressured him to quit the Missouri race. At least two people at the conference named Karl Rove, a co-founder of the powerful 527 group American Crossroads, as a specific source of frustration.\n\nParticipants in Thursday's meetings said support for Akin was not universal among conservatives. Richard Land, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission at the Southern Baptist Convention, said that while Akin misspoke and has been treated \"unfairly,\" he should still drop out.\n\nAkin addressed a small dinner on Wednesday night but made no direct mention of the scandal engulfing his campaign, two sources present for that session told CNN. The congressman, who has deep ties to the Christian right, is also hosting an invitation-only reception on Thursday evening.\n\nMuch of the discussion about the future of Akin's campaign is taking place during face-to-face meetings with top leaders in the conservative movement attending the CNP summit. Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, was among those who spoke privately with Akin on Thursday. Reed declined to reveal details of their conversation but made plain his sympathy for Akin: \"As a general rule, I have devoted my career to encouraging men and women of faith to run for office. I don't encourage men and women of faith not to run.\"\n\nAlong with Land and Reed, the conference was attended by Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly, direct mail specialist Richard Viguerie, National Rifle Association Chairman David Keene, former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, pollster Kellyanne Conway, Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, Americans United For Life founder Charmaine Yoest, former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, and many others.\n\nAlso present were a fleet of talk radio hosts, communications consultants, school reform activists, and several Republican political operatives. Little is known about the CNP, aside from a website which describes its members as \"the country's most influential conservative leaders in business, government, politics, and religion.\" New members must be vouched for and invited by current ones. One person described CNP meetings as \"media free zones\" where conservatives can network and strategize freely.\n\nEven members of the group who spoke to CNN anonymously were hesitant to discuss the group or anything related to the Akin controversy. \"I can't talk about what they talk about here, it's all confidential,\" said one CNP participant. \"Sorry.\"\n\nWhen Akin was approached by a CNN camera while sitting on a veranda Thursday outside the hotel, an aide quickly moved to block the photographer's shot. Politico first reported Akin's trip to Tampa on Wednesday to attend the conference, but the details of Akin's whereabouts and the details of his meetings were not known until Thursday.",
    " Title: A Dozen Notable Achievements of 2016\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final days of 2016, it is worth acknowledging a dozen significant achievements that occurred throughout the year.\n\n1. Minimum wage increases: Minimum wage-earning Americans in 22 jurisdictions, including 20 states and the District of Columbia, received a wage boost in 2017. New York City is set to reach a minimum wage of $15 by 2019, with the rest of the state on a path to that level in the future. Washington state raised its minimum wage to $11 an hour as of January 1, while Arizona increased it to $10 an hour. California is raising its minimum wage by 50 cents in 2017 and again in 2018, and then by a dollar a year through 2022 to reach $15 an hour.\n\n2. Reproductive rights victory: In a 5-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of reproductive rights in the case of Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt. The Court found that Texas laws requiring doctors at clinics providing abortions to have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles and that the clinics have facilities equal to a mini-hospital constituted an undue burden on abortion access and violated the Constitution.\n\n3. Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill: Thanks to activist efforts, the Treasury will be replacing Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.\n\n4. Increase in wild tiger population: For the first time in a century, the number of tigers in the wild increased. The count is now 3,820 compared with 3,200 in 2010.\n\n5. Malaria eradication in Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka's bold 2009 plan to wipe out malaria worked. The country is now malaria-free.\n\n6. Lower U.S. unemployment rate: The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent, the lowest level in nine years.\n\n7. Colombia peace agreement: After 50 years of civil war, the Colombian government and FARC guerrillas signed a peace agreement.\n\n8. Paris climate agreement: The Paris climate agreement came into force. It took 25 years to get a solid agreement, but in October, 55 countries representing 58.85 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions ratified the Paris pact with the goal of cutting those emissions quickly and deeply enough to keep the world's average temperature from rising more than 3.6\u00b0 Fahrenheit by the turn of the century.\n\n9. Ebola vaccine: Researchers developed a vaccine against ebola that is 100 percent effective.\n\n10. Ending female genital mutilation: 300 West African communities pledged to end female genital mutilation.\n\n11. Olympic success for U.S. gymnasts: U.S. gymnasts Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, Laurie Hernandez, and Madison Kocian won a record nine Olympic medals among them.\n\n12. Criticism of Kent Hovind: In 2005, Ken Ham of the Young Earth Creationist organization Answers in Genesis (AiG) published a point-by-point critique of Kent Hovind, warning that fellow creationists should avoid using Hovind's arguments as they are riddled with errors and/or dishonesty. Ham's organization is known for building a museum that depicts men and women living side by side with dinosaurs 6,000 years ago and for constructing large dioramas of the Ark.",
    " Title: Tennessee School District Reviews Allegations of Unconstitutional Mentoring Program\n\nArticle:\n\nOfficials from the Kingsport City Schools in Tennessee are reviewing allegations by the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) that their mentoring program, in partnership with a local church, is unconstitutional. The FFRF, a group that identifies its members as \"free-thinkers\" (atheists and agnostics), claims in a letter to the school district that the mentoring program with Christ Fellowship Church impermissibly advances religion and that the district \"cannot allow its schools to be used as recruiting grounds for churches.\"\n\nThe FFRF does not cite a specific incident in the warning letter where a mentor has tried to proselytize a student. However, it complains that the program uses church personnel to interact with students during school hours. The group states, \"Religious organizations should never be allowed access to such young public school children.\"\n\nJoe Gervais, a mentor from Christ Fellowship Church at Kingsport's John Adams Elementary School, told a School Board meeting that mentors spend 45 minutes to an hour each week with assigned students, often eating breakfast or lunch with them, as well as playing games or reading to them. Gervais said he asks his student about their day, problems they might be having, life in general, and what's going on at home.\n\nSchool superintendent Jeff Moorhouse described the mentoring program as \"just having more hands grabbing an oar\" to help students in school and in life. The program involves churches and other groups, according to Moorhouse.\n\nAdams Elementary school counselor Ashley Marlowe reported that fifteen students were mentored under the program at Adams last year and just eight this year due to a shortage of volunteers.\n\nThe FFRF's stance is not new, as the group has previously objected to religious practices and traditions in various communities, particularly in the Bible Belt. The group has criticized the governor of Oklahoma for mingling religion and state and objected to prayer before football games, among other issues.\n\nThe FFRF's stance raises questions about the role of religion in public schools and the balance between religious freedom and the separation of church and state. The argument brings up the question of whether the FFRF's interpretation of history and the Constitution allows for Christians, acting from faith, to contribute to \"social and moral progress\" in their communities without leaving their religiously-motivated conviction outside the school premises. The ongoing status of the mentoring program remains uncertain as the school district reviews the allegations.",
    " Title: Radio Host Rush Limbaugh Criticizes Republican Party for Neglecting the Tea Party Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nRadio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, in a recent broadcast, criticized the Republican Party for not embracing the Tea Party movement in 2010, a decision he believes cost the party in the 2012 elections. According to Limbaugh, the Tea Party's disenchantment with the Republican Party stems from the issues that sparked their movement in 2010 worsening.\n\nLimbaugh argued that the Republican Party had potential allies in the Tea Party movement but chose to distance themselves. He suggested that the party could have welcomed the Tea Party into their ranks and built a movement around them. However, the Tea Party activists who attended rallies and town hall meetings in 2010 were often vilified by the media and Democrats, causing Republican leadership to distance themselves, Limbaugh claimed.\n\nIn Limbaugh's view, the Republican Party establishment perceives the Tea Party as unsophisticated, emotional, and out of control. He suggests that the party leadership aimed to contain the Tea Party rather than embracing them. The Tea Party, on the other hand, understands this, Limbaugh said, and sees the Republican Party as uninterested in their support.\n\nLimbaugh expected the Tea Party to make a significant impact in the 2012 presidential election, but was proven wrong. He attributes this to the Tea Party feeling rejected by the Republican Party. In 2014, there will be no presidential candidate on the ticket, meaning Tea Party members will be less constrained in showing up at the polls, according to Limbaugh. He also believes that the Tea Party will be more motivated due to the desire to prevent President Obama from gaining control over all branches of the government.",
    " Title: Senate's Balanced Budget Proposal Fails to Reach Floor Vote, Signaling Fiscal Responsibility Struggles in Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Rand Paul's (R-Ky.) balanced budget proposal, known as the \"Pennies Plan,\" failed to reach a floor vote in the Republican-controlled Senate on Monday. The bill fell short during a procedural vote when only 22 senators voted in favor of a cloture motion that would have brought the bill to a final vote. A majority of Republicans and all Democrats voted against proceeding to a floor vote on the bill.\n\nPaul's proposal called for a 2 percent reduction in the federal budget for each of the next five years, aiming to reduce federal spending by about $11 trillion over the next decade. The plan is an adaptation of the so-called \"Penny Plan\" that Paul has been advocating for several years, though he now argues for an additional penny in cuts for every federal dollar spent to achieve a balanced budget.\n\nThe growing gap between federal spending and revenue is a significant concern. During the first seven months of the current fiscal year, which began in October 2018, the federal government ran a $531 billion deficit, marking a 38 percent increase over the same period last year.\n\nAccording to an analysis from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, about 60 percent of this year's expected deficit is the result of policies\u2014mostly last year's significant increase in spending that surpassed Obama-era budget caps\u2014put in place by current legislators and signed by the current president.\n\nThe share of debt held by the public currently stands at about 78 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), a shorthand measure of a country's economic output in a single year. This figure is actually worse, as \"debt held by the public\" accounts for only $15.8 trillion of the $21 trillion national debt. The remaining debt is held by parts of the federal government, such as the Social Security trust fund.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) warned in April that America's current fiscal situation is \"unsustainable.\" The GAO estimates that the amount of debt held by the public is on track to surpass the all-time high of 106 percent of GDP within the next 13 to 20 years.\n\nCongress's apparent apathy towards the growing federal debt remains a concern. Paul, in a statement before the vote, criticized both parties for their fiscal irresponsibility. He accused Republicans of supporting balanced budgets in rhetoric but not in action, and Democrats of pushing for excessive spending plans that would exacerbate the national debt or require massive tax increases.\n\nLast year, Paul was able to get the balanced budget proposal to the Senate floor after striking a deal with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) during an earlier budget impasse to get the bill on the floor. Paul called that vote a \"litmus test for conservatives,\" and most of them failed it as the measure went down in flames, 76 to 21.",
    " Title: U.S. Imposes Tariffs on Chinese Imports, Affecting Consumer Goods and Retail Sector\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has announced plans to impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, effective from Monday, with the potential to increase to 25% next year. This move is part of an escalating trade dispute between the world's two largest economies.\n\nThe new tariffs, which will primarily target consumer goods, could lead to increased prices for American consumers, according to analysts Seema Shah and Danielle McIntee of Bloomberg Intelligence. They stated in a note on Friday that the new tariffs will negatively impact the retail sector in 2019, with lower-income families being most affected due to potential price increases on everyday items.\n\nThe latest round of tariffs follows a 25% duty already imposed on about $50 billion in Chinese goods, which prompted counter-tariffs from Beijing. China has announced plans to retaliate on the U.S.'s $200 billion tariff round by imposing levies on $60 billion of American goods.\n\nThe U.S. is monitoring China's retaliation to the $200 billion round of tariffs, but no further announcements have been made regarding additional rounds of duties. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross previously stated that the tariffs are spread over a wide range of goods, aiming to minimize disruption for American consumers.\n\nThe U.S. remains open to trade negotiations with China, but there are currently no scheduled meetings. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has extended an invitation to resume trade talks with Chinese counterparts, although China had previously stated they would refuse to negotiate if the Trump administration followed through with the $200 billion tariff round.",
    " Title: White House Discord: Nikki Haley and Larry Kudlow's Remarkable Display of Political Differences\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent back-and-forth regarding Russian sanctions and the role of Nikki Haley, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, has sparked discussions about the Trump administration's foreign policy and the individuals who represent the president. The White House has demonstrated its capacity for bold diplomatic moves, such as the secret meetings between Mike Pompeo, the CIA director and likely future Secretary of State, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. However, the administration's approach to foreign policy has raised questions about communication and coordination.\n\nThe controversy began when Haley, during an appearance on \"Face the Nation,\" announced that the administration was preparing to impose sanctions on Russian companies dealing with equipment related to Syrian President Bashar Assad and chemical weapons. These sanctions were expected to be announced by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday. However, the sanctions were not imposed as announced, leading to speculation and subsequent discord within the administration.\n\nThe New York Times reported that President Trump grew angry when he learned of Haley's statement, leading to a public display of disagreement. Economic adviser Larry Kudlow initially described Haley's statement as a case of confusion, but later apologized for his remarks and acknowledged that there had been a change in policy without Haley being informed.\n\nHaley responded to Kudlow's comments with a statement to Fox News, stating, \"With all due respect, I do not get confused.\" The Washington Post described this as an \"extraordinary rebuke of the White House.\"\n\nThe incident has been interpreted as another example of discord within Trump's team regarding foreign affairs. The underlying cause of the disagreement between Haley and the administration remains unclear, with some suggesting it may stem from differing views on Russia and the president's efforts to cultivate good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe episode has been characterized as a communication breakdown within the White House, with neither Haley nor Kudlow bearing sole responsibility for the misunderstanding. The incident underscores the unpredictable nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy and the challenges of coordinating a diverse team of advisors.\n\nAxios summarized the situation, stating, \"These conflicts with top aides\u2014one of them unfolding in the open\u2014show that, in the end, the president will govern how he wants.\" The future of the Trump administration's foreign policy remains uncertain, with the potential for further disagreements and miscommunications as the administration navigates complex international issues.",
    " Title: Gallup Poll Reveals Record Low Trust in U.S. Media Among Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to a recent Gallup poll, the trust and confidence Americans have in the media to report news accurately, fully, and fairly has reached an all-time low in the organization's history. Only 32% of respondents expressed a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media, marking an eight-percentage-point decrease from the previous year.\n\nThe lowest level of trust was recorded in 1972, when the poll was first conducted, with 72% of Americans expressing trust in the media. However, since then, the sentiment has been steadily declining and has not surpassed a majority level since 2007.\n\nThe decline in trust among Republicans has been particularly significant, with only 14% expressing trust, down from 32% a year ago. This represents the lowest level of confidence among Republicans in the past 20 years. Among Democrats, the number stands at 51%, while independents report a trust level of 30%.\n\nThe analyst, Art Swift, suggests that the sharp decline in trust this year may be due to the ongoing election campaign. With many Republican leaders and conservative pundits claiming that Hillary Clinton has received overly positive media attention, while Donald Trump has faced unfair or negative attention, this may be a primary reason for the erosion of trust among Republicans. It is also possible that the lower trust in the media among Republicans is a result of Trump's frequent criticisms of the press.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed 1,020 U.S. adults from September 7-11, indicates a continued decline in Americans' trust in the media, raising concerns about the role of the press in a democratic society.",
    " Title: Senators Sanders, Whitehouse, Warren, and Merkley Urge DOJ to Continue Investigation into Fossil Fuel Industry's Climate Denial Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of four Democratic senators, led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, have urged Attorney General Loretta Lynch to continue the Department of Justice's (DOJ) inquiry into the fossil fuel industry's climate denial operations. The request comes a day after Senate Republicans called for the probe to cease.\n\nIn a Thursday letter, Senators Sanders, Sheldon Whitehouse, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, argued that the DOJ should investigate possible fraud in the fossil fuel industry's climate denial operations. They compared this potential fraud to the tobacco industry's deceptive practices regarding the health risks of smoking.\n\nIn March, Ms. Lynch stated that she had referred information on what Mr. Whitehouse described as \"the climate denial scheme\" to the FBI. Senate Republicans have criticized this effort as an attack on free speech and scientific inquiry.\n\nThe Democrats' letter asserts that \"fraud is not protected by the First Amendment,\" and they draw parallels between the tobacco industry and oil-and-gas companies that have been skeptical of catastrophic climate-change predictions. They also reference the DOJ's 2006 civil lawsuit against the tobacco industry, using it as a template for the DOJ's potential investigation into the fossil fuel industry.\n\nCritics have disputed the comparison, arguing that there is more scientific disagreement on the impact of increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere on the climate than there was on the link between smoking and major health problems.\n\nMs. Lynch stated at a Senate oversight hearing in March that she had referred information to the FBI to determine \"whether or not it meets the criteria for what we could take action on.\" The status of the inquiry remains unclear, as Justice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle declined to comment further on the matter.\n\nIn a Wednesday letter, Senate Republicans argued that efforts to prosecute climate-change skeptics constitute a \"blatant violation of the First Amendment and an abuse of power that rises to the level of prosecutorial misconduct.\" The letter was signed by Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, David Perdue of Georgia, and David Vitter of Louisiana.\n\nLast week, 13 House Republicans sent letters seeking information from a coalition of state attorneys general, known as AGs United for Clean Power, on their efforts to pursue climate-change skeptics. Two of those attorneys general\u2014New York's Eric Schneiderman and the Virgin Islands' Claude E. Walker\u2014have since issued subpoenas to ExxonMobil.

    " Title: Corey Lewandowski Refuses to Answer Questions Regarding 2017 Oval Office Meeting During House Judiciary Committee Hearing\n\nCorey Lewandowski, a former campaign aide to President Donald Trump, clashed with House Democrats during a public impeachment hearing on Tuesday, refusing to answer questions about a 2017 Oval Office meeting that was detailed in the Mueller report.\n\nIn his opening statement, Lewandowski, who is considered close to the White House, criticized the Democrats and former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, describing it as \"harassment\" and alleging that some critics sought to bring down the president.\n\n\"Sadly, the country spent over three years and 40 million taxpayer dollars on these investigations. It is now clear the investigation was populated by many Trump haters who had their own agenda \u2014 to try and take down a duly elected president of the United States,\" Lewandowski said.\n\nDuring the hearing, Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) sought to question Lewandowski about the 2017 Oval Office meeting in which Trump asked Lewandowski to persuade then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his recusal and set new limits on the Mueller probe.\n\nLewandowski initially insisted that Nadler provide a copy of the Mueller report so that he could follow along with the passages as Democrats read them. He then stated that he does not remember the meeting in question.\n\nThe hearing became chaotic as Republicans and Democrats argued over whether the clock should be suspended on Nadler's five minutes of questioning. The GOP members pushed for an adjournment of the panel.\n\nDemocrats have stated that they will not accept limitations on Lewandowski's testimony, as he is the committee's first fact witness and is considered part of the president's efforts to block Mueller's probe into possible obstruction. They also criticized the White House for seeking to block his testimony on the grounds that his discussions with Trump fall under executive branch confidentiality interests.",
    " Title: U.S.-China Trade Tensions: A Historical Perspective and Current Developments\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China have been a topic of significant discussion, with President Trump frequently criticizing China's trade practices. He often states that the U.S. has been disadvantaged in trade relations with China for many years, referring to the past four decades during which China has rapidly transformed from a poor, developing country to an economic powerhouse.\n\nChina's emergence as a global economic power was rapid and extreme, according to the article, outpacing the world's ability to adapt in some ways, even China's own capacity to manage such growth. The U.S. and other Western nations facilitated much of China's rise through open trade, but have struggled to get China's fundamentally different economic system to adhere to free market rules.\n\nA pivotal moment came in 2001, after 15 years of negotiations, when China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). This organization sets the rules for free and fair trade between member countries. The U.S. and other countries put numerous demands on China for reforms, and China agreed to lower tariffs and reduce the government's role in business operations. However, China argued, as it still does now, that it should be held to less stringent free trade standards due to its status as a developing country.\n\nChina has continued to operate as a centrally planned economy, with the government owning, influencing, or subsidizing major industries, giving them an artificial competitive edge. There are heavy restrictions on foreign investment, and foreign companies are pressured to share their technologies.\n\nIn 2001, after China joined the WTO, there was an enormous surge of Chinese exports to countries worldwide, and particularly to the U.S. The U.S. and other countries complained that China was not opening its markets enough and was keeping the value of its currency artificially low to make Chinese exports more attractive.\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), initiated by Bush and signed by Obama, was an attempt to counter China's growing economic power. The TPP was intended to boost trade, support jobs, and establish stronger rules for trade across the Asia-Pacific region. However, President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the TPP on his third day in office.\n\nTrade tensions between the U.S. and China continue to escalate, with both countries imposing tariffs on each other's goods. The article suggests that China sees its economy as strong enough to withstand the U.S.'s tariffs, while the U.S. aims to generate a moment of crisis to force China to reform its economic practices. The future of U.S.-China trade relations remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Marco Rubio's Presidential Campaign Faces Fundraising and Organizational Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nMarco Rubio's presidential campaign has faced setbacks in terms of fundraising and organization, according to a recent analysis of the Florida senator's third-quarter campaign finance report. The campaign has been criticized for inaccurate financial statements and a lack of early-state organization compared to many of its rivals.\n\nRubio's campaign initially claimed to have more campaign cash in the bank than fellow Floridian Jeb Bush, but it was later revealed that the statement was inaccurate. The campaign also overstated its fundraising for the last quarter, reporting $6 million instead of the actual $5.7 million.\n\nMoreover, Rubio's third-quarter filing revealed a campaign that is out-manned by many of its rivals in the early-voting states. Rubio's staff is primarily based in Washington, with a small umbrella of early-state operatives. This puts Rubio at a disadvantage because he has not invested the time in early-state visits that some of his opponents have.\n\nOperatives in early-voting primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire have noted that Rubio has spent a combined three weeks in these states this year, while New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who trails Rubio in the polls, has spent six weeks in New Hampshire alone. A longtime New Hampshire operative stated that Rubio has \"missed a lot of opportunities over the year where he could've been here more regularly.\"\n\nRubio's cash-on-hand for the primary season is currently $9.7 million, trailing Ben Carson, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Jeb Bush in cash heading into the last three months of 2015. Donald Trump, the frontrunner, has pledged to primarily self-finance his campaign.\n\nRubio's campaign has set a fundraising target of $15 million for the next quarter, but this is more than double what Rubio raised between the end of June and the end of September. Rubio is also hampered in his hunt for home state dollars by Jeb Bush, who released a bundler list Thursday that is studded with Florida heavyweights.\n\nWith primary elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada in February, followed by a burst of Southern primaries on March 1 and the do-or-die Florida primary on March 15, Rubio's more vigorous fundraising operation will be necessary.\n\nRubio allies note that his ambitious fundraising goal is not out of reach. Rubio has had some success in winning over supporters of former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who dropped out of the race in late September. He has also been aggressively courting some megadonors whose support could make a significant difference due to their political donor networks.\n\nBackers emphasize that there is plenty of time to continue building out a field organization in key states, and that large campaign operations are not always winning operations. Rubio and his aides take pride in the campaign's small staff footprint, with only 54 full-time staffers.\n\nJeff Sadosky, spokesman for a super PAC backing Rubio, Conservative Solutions, states that Rubio's message and talent at communicating it are undervalued. \"The right message coming from the party\u2019s best messenger is as effective a turnout machine as anything you can put together,\" said Sadosky. \"I can also say that Conservative Solutions PAC stands ready to provide the support needed to ensure that Marco\u2019s message is heard by voters in the early states.\"\n\nIn South Carolina, an early state where Rubio has shown signs of strength, his allies remain confident about his prospects. \"I would suggest the senator has the most robust operation in South Carolina already,\" said Mikee Johnson, a Rubio fundraiser and chairman of the state's Chamber of Commerce. \"His supporters are... ardent to the point of volunteerism for his effort and for our country. I know this sounds idealistic, but I have seen it first-hand.\"",
    " Title: Senate Confirms Neil Gorsuch as Supreme Court Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has confirmed President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, following a contentious 14-month battle for control of the highest court in the nation. The chamber voted 54-45 on Friday to confirm Gorsuch's appointment.\n\nRepublicans, who control the Senate, took the unprecedented step this week of changing the chamber's rules to expedite the confirmation process. The battle to appoint a justice to the judicial bench began with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative justice, in February 2016. This marked the longest period a seat has remained unfilled on the Supreme Court since the American Civil War in 1862.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Gorsuch, a 49-year-old judge from the Denver appeals court, proved evasive when questioned on legal matters. However, he has a conservative judicial pedigree and is expected to rule accordingly. Republicans hope Gorsuch will provide a 5-4 majority for the bench's conservative justices.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell praised Gorsuch, stating, \"He's going to make an incredible addition to the court.\" In contrast, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who led the opposition to Gorsuch, said, \"The court is increasingly drifting towards becoming a more pro-corporate court that favors employers, corporations, and special interests over working America.\"\n\nOn Thursday, McConnell invoked a legislative maneuver known as the \"nuclear option\" when Republicans lacked the 60 votes required to end debate on Gorsuch. The chamber's majority leader effectively dismantled the rulebook after Democrats mounted the first filibuster of such a nominee in half a century.\n\nThe confirmation of Gorsuch marks a significant victory for Trump's young presidency. Many of those who voted for him prioritized getting a conservative judge on to America's highest court. \"Congratulations to an exceptionally qualified and respected judge,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe vacancy on the nine-judge bench had left the justices to pass over many controversial issues, potentially to avoid a 4-4 stalemate. Democrats were left frustrated last year when Republicans refused to consider former President Barack Obama's nominee to the court.\n\nIn 2013, Democrats used the \"nuclear option\" to overturn Republican filibusters against executive branch and judicial nominees for lower courts. However, they left the filibuster in place for Supreme Court nominees. Gorsuch may be sworn in as early as Friday to prepare for the court's next session of oral arguments this month.",
    " Title: Man Arrested for Carrying Assault Rifle in Washington D.C. Pizzeria, Intending to Investigate \"Pizzagate\" Conspiracy\n\nArticle:\n\nA North Carolina man, identified as Edgar Maddison Welch, was arrested in Washington D.C. on Sunday after he entered a popular pizzeria, Comet Ping Pong, armed with an assault rifle, to investigate the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory. According to reports, Welch pointed his gun at an employee and apparently fired it into the ground before police arrested him. No one was injured, and Welch was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon.\n\nThe \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory, which has been debunked as baseless, posits that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager, John Podesta, were involved in a child sex trafficking ring. Comet Ping Pong has been a target of visitors seeking to verify the conspiracy theory for weeks, despite the restaurant not having a basement, a key element of the conspiracy theory.\n\nThe restaurant's owners and employees have been subjected to threats and unsubstantiated stories about trafficking for weeks. Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis stated that the abuse they have endured is baffling, especially considering the restaurant does not have a basement.\n\nThe restaurant's owners supported Clinton during the presidential election, which some believe may have played a role in the development of the conspiracy, as even those close to President-elect Donald Trump have reportedly half-bought into the rumor. Alefantis expressed hope that those involved in promoting the falsehoods will stop doing so, stating, \"What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories comes with consequences.\"",
    " Title: US Customs and Border Protection Deploys Teargas Against Migrants in Tijuana\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) deployed teargas towards a group of approximately 150 Central American migrants attempting to cross the border in Tijuana, Mexico, during the early hours of New Year's Day. The incident occurred as the migrants attempted to breach the border fence.\n\nIn a statement released later on Tuesday, CBP stated that the teargas was aimed at rock throwers, not the migrants attempting to cross the border. The statement read, \"No agents witnessed any of the migrants at the fence line, including children, experiencing effects of the chemical agents, which were targeted at the rock throwers further away.\"\n\nHowever, an Associated Press (AP) photographer reported seeing at least three volleys of gas launched onto the Mexican side of the border, affecting migrants, including women and children, as well as journalists. The AP saw rocks thrown only after U.S. agents fired the teargas.\n\nCBP reported that agents saw \"toddler-sized children\" being passed over concertina wire with difficulty. They stated that their agents could not assist the children due to the rocks being thrown. Agents responded with smoke, pepper spray, and teargas, according to CBP, and the AP journalist also observed plastic pellets fired by U.S. agents.\n\nA total of 25 migrants were detained, while others crawled back into Mexico through a hole under the fence. CBP stated that under its use of force policy, the incident will be reviewed by its Office of Professional Responsibility.\n\nMany of the migrants are reported to have arrived in Tijuana last month as part of the caravan from Honduras. The caravan, which grew to over 6,000 members during its month-and-a-half journey north, has been a constant target of President Donald Trump, who frequently referred to it in the run-up to the midterm elections in November.\n\nMany of the migrants are waiting in Tijuana for a chance to apply for asylum in the U.S., but there was a backlog before the caravan's arrival, and the wait is expected to be many months. Others have found jobs in Mexico and tried to settle there.\n\nIn a previous incident, U.S. agents launched teargas across the border after some migrants tried to breach the border following a peaceful march in Tijuana on 26 November. Hundreds of migrants who were downwind of the gas were affected.\n\nPresident Trump is currently embroiled in a fight with congressional Democrats over funding for the border wall that he wants to build. The stalemate has led to a partial government shutdown.",
    " Title: Facebook Executives and Employees Contribute Significantly to Committees Questioning CEO Mark Zuckerberg on User Privacy\n\nArticle:\n\nMembers of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will question Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about user privacy protection next week, are among the biggest recipients of campaign contributions from Facebook employees directly and the political action committee (PAC) funded by employees. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which will also question Zuckerberg, is the second-highest recipient.\n\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee have received nearly $381,000 in contributions tied to Facebook since 2007. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee received $369,000, while the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will also question Zuckerberg, received $235,000.\n\nFacebook's contributions to the House Energy and Commerce Committee are disproportionately skewed towards Republicans, with Republicans receiving roughly twice as much as Democrats. Of the $7 million in contributions to all federal candidates tied to Facebook, Democrats received 65%, while Republicans received 33%.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee has 55 members this year, and all but nine have received Facebook contributions in the past decade. The average Republican received $6,800, while the average Democrat received $6,750. Committee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., received $27,000, while Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top-ranking Democrat, received $7,000.\n\nWalden and Pallone jointly announced that the committee will question Zuckerberg on April 11 to \"shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues and help all Americans better understand what happens to their personal information online.\"\n\nA Facebook spokesman responded to questions about the contributions by pointing to an April 2017 statement the company issued to employees about \"political engagement.\" The statement said it is important for the company to \"develop relationships with elected officials...who share our vision of an open Internet.\" The statement also described the company's PAC and said decisions about which candidates get support are based on whether their policy positions are consistent with the company's \"and whether the candidate holds a key committee or leadership position.\"\n\nA spokesman for Democrats on the House committee, C.J. Young, said he could not discuss campaign contributions. \"But the premise that Facebook is getting softballs from the committee isn\u2019t grounded in the facts,\" Young said, citing Walden and Pallone's insistence that Zuckerberg appear at a public hearing to address user privacy.\n\nFacebook estimated that as many as 87 million accounts could have had their data improperly shared by Cambridge Analytica, a political targeting firm that worked on President Trump's 2016 campaign. Facebook suspended the firm's account after concluding Cambridge Analytica obtained and did not destroy personal information from users who had downloaded a personality profile app.\n\nA member of both of the Senate committees that will question Zuckerberg on Tuesday is Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. As an opponent of Trump in the 2016 presidential race, Cruz's campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5.8 million. Cruz received a $15,000 contribution tied to Facebook in 2012, but nothing since then. Rep. O'Rourke, the Texas Democrat vying to unseat Cruz, is the fourth-highest recipient of contributions tied to Facebook in this election cycle, receiving nearly $13,000.\n\nFred Wertheimer, founder and president of the campaign finance reform advocacy group Democracy21, said having a committee that got the most contributions from Facebook question its top executive about a national controversy demonstrates why the system needs to be changed. \"Powerful interests provide lots of money to the committees that have jurisdiction over them, and they do it to gain influence with those members of Congress,\" Wertheimer said. \"It\u2019s a fundamental problem that exists throughout the system and throughout the committee structure, and it undermines public confidence that the members are going to make decisions in the best interests of the American people.\"\n\nAnother giant in the tech industry, Google parent Alphabet, gave more in the 2016 presidential race, $8.8 million, than Facebook's PAC and its employees gave in the past decade. The top House committee receiving Alphabet contributions that year was again the Energy and Commerce Committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics' data. Members of a handful of other Senate committees got more than members of the Senate Commerce or Judiciary committees, however.\n\nThe top recipient of Facebook contributions on the House commerce committee, receiving $51,050, was Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat whose district is adjacent to Facebook's headquarters and is home to many company employees. Eshoo narrowly lost a battle with Pallone for the top Democratic spot on the committee after the 2014 election.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who is not on the committee, received the most Facebook contributions in the House, totaling $55,150 since 2007. Overall, Facebook has contributed $1.1 million to House members, split almost evenly between the parties.\n\nIn addition to campaign contributions, Facebook spent $11.5 million lobbying Congress last year, and its total spending on lobbying since 2009 is nearly $52 million. Plus, nearly 30 members of Congress own Facebook stock, according to a story in Roll Call, including two Democratic members of the committee who will question Zuckerberg next week. Massachusetts Rep. Joseph Kennedy's investment is worth at least $80,000 and is held in trust funds. Oregon Rep. Kurt Schrader's stake is worth at least $15,000.",
    " Title: Minimum Wage Hikes and Automation: A Closer Look at California's $15 Hourly Wage\n\nArticle:\n\nAs states like California and cities such as Seattle implement minimum wages of up to $15 per hour, critics have expressed concerns about potential job losses due to increased automation. Outlets like the Wall Street Journal's editorial page and Forbes' Tim Worstall argue that significant increases in minimum wages will lead to job loss through automation, with robots replacing workers in industries like fast food.\n\nHowever, this perspective may be misguided. Firstly, there is no guarantee that increased minimum wages will accelerate the development and adoption of labor-saving technology. On the contrary, the implementation of higher minimum wages could incentivize the creation and adoption of high-quality new equipment to automate elements of industries like the food service industry, leading to a positive outcome.\n\nProductivity-enhancing technology is a crucial component of social and economic progress. If minimum wage hikes do indeed spur the creation and adoption of such technology, it would imply that minimum wage hikes are a good idea.\n\nCalifornia's minimum wage hike presents unique challenges, as it pushes the issue beyond the terrain in which it has been studied. The optimistic outcome is a significant increase in automation. The primary concern should be that the robots may not materialize, not that they will.\n\nFor workers displaced by automated service industry jobs, many would find new employment opportunities. Most restaurants would likely extend their operating hours, providing more shifts for workers. The advanced robo-restaurant technology itself would be a valuable American export good, creating jobs in design and sales.\n\nSome low-wage work would be reallocated out of the relatively low-social-value restaurant sector and into areas like child care and home health assistance, where there is ample demand. As poor people earn more money, they would have the means to purchase goods and services they previously could not afford, creating demand for new jobs.\n\nIf robots can perform a significant portion of the work, we could afford to reduce the workweek, lowering the retirement age and providing more financial support to college students and new parents. Fewer people would be doing part-time food service work, and more would be able to take advantage of four weeks of paid vacation and extended parental leave.\n\nThe scenario to worry about with minimum wage hikes is that no technological solution will emerge. In this case, restaurant operations would remain the same, but employing people to work in them would become more expensive. In pricey, crowded cities, the results wouldn't be so bad, as operating a restaurant would become less lucrative, leading to lower bids for prime restaurant locations.\n\nHowever, in less crowded, less expensive locations where labor is a larger slice of the overall cost pie, it would mean fewer restaurants opening and shorter operating hours. This would make it more difficult for people to find jobs, not just low-end jobs, but also better-paying managerial and construction jobs. Convenient meals would also be harder to come by.\n\nSome people would benefit through higher pay, but others would struggle to find work unless they move to a different state that is friendlier to opening new restaurants. The ability of a legislative push for high pay to spur the development and deployment of new productivity-enhancing technology is the significant unknown about the minimum wage.\n\nExisting studies of the labor market impact of minimum wage hikes generally find very small effects on employment based on small wage increases. The question they address is essentially whether a small hike in the wage floor introduces a small inefficiency into the labor market or whether it corrects for an existing inefficiency that gives employers some monopoly pricing power over workers.\n\nThis is an interesting question, but the wage-innovation question is a much more difficult\u2014and yet important\u2014one. The prevailing conventional wisdom in Western policy circles over the past generation has been that innovation is something that just happens. However, the assumption that the government cannot summon productivity-enhancing technology into existence by waving a magic minimum wage wand is not a proven proposition.\n\nThe fact that so many minimum wage skeptics think it's intuitively wrong is telling and interesting. A cheap labor economy may not offer as many incentives for companies to identify and promote managers who are skilled at finding, developing, and deploying labor-saving technology. Perhaps if a large, dynamic, and innovative state like California forces companies to eschew cheap labor, they will respond by innovating and reducing their need for workers.\n\nAt least, residents of inland California had better hope that happens. Otherwise, they may find themselves packing their bags for Texas.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton's Use of Personal Email During Tenure as Secretary of State\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton, during her tenure as Secretary of State, exclusively used a personal email account for conducting official government business, according to a report in the New York Times. This practice may have violated federal requirements that official correspondence be retained as part of the State Department's records.\n\nClinton did not have a government email address during her four-year term at the State Department. Her aides took no actions to have her personal emails preserved on department servers at the time, as required by the Federal Records Act. It was only two months ago, in response to a new State Department effort to comply with federal record-keeping practices, that Clinton's advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails and decided which ones to turn over to the State Department. All told, 55,000 pages of emails were given to the department. Clinton stepped down from the secretary's post in early 2013.\n\nThe expansive use of the private account was alarming to current and former National Archives and Records Administration officials and government watchdogs, who called it a serious breach. This is not the first time the Obama administration has been caught evading federal records laws by using personal email, which ultimately allows officials to escape scrutiny under the Freedom of Information Act and Congressional investigation.\n\nThe existence of Clinton's personal email account was discovered as a House committee investigating the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi sought correspondence between Clinton and her aides about the attack. The Benghazi Select Committee, headed by Congressman Trey Gowdy, is continuing its investigation. Clinton will likely have to answer for her non-transparency and years of federal law violation should she announce a run for the White House in April.",
    " Title: Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan Dies at 80\n\nArticle:\n\nThe former United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, has passed away at the age of 80 following a brief illness, his family and foundation announced on Saturday. Born in Kumasi, Ghana, on April 8, 1938, Annan served as the seventh Secretary-General and held the position for two terms between 1997 and 2006. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work jointly with the UN in 2001.\n\nAnnan died in a hospital in Bern, Switzerland, in the early hours of Saturday, with his wife, Nane, and three children, Ama, Kojo, and Nina, by his side. He had retired to Geneva and later lived in a Swiss village.\n\nThe Annan Foundation issued a statement on his Twitter account on Saturday, describing him as a \"global statesman and deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer and more peaceful world.\"\n\nKofi Annan's (@KofiAnnan) Twitter account shared a statement that read, \"In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organization into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination.\"\n\nThe current UN Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who was appointed to lead its refugee agency by Annan, said, \"Kofi Annan was a great diplomat, a true statesman, and a wonderful colleague who was widely respected and will be greatly missed.\"\n\nThe former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, expressed his shock and distress over Annan's death on Twitter, stating, \"He was a good friend whom I saw only weeks ago. Kofi Annan was a great diplomat, a true statesman, and a wonderful colleague who was widely respected and will be greatly missed.\"\n\nThe Russian President, Vladimir Putin, and the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, also paid tribute to Annan, with Putin describing him as a \"wise and courageous\" leader, and Merkel as an \"exceptional statesman in the service of the global community.\"\n\nAnnan was the chair of The Elders, an independent group of global leaders working for peace and human rights founded by Nelson Mandela. Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former Prime Minister of Norway and the body's deputy chair, said she and her colleagues were devastated by Annan's death.\n\n\"Kofi was a strong and inspiring presence to us all, and The Elders would not be where it is today without his leadership. Throughout his life, Kofi worked unceasingly to improve the lives of millions of people around the world,\" she said.\n\nKumi Naidoo, Amnesty International's Secretary-General, said the world had lost a great leader. \"Kofi's dedication and drive for a more peaceful and just world, his lifelong championing of human rights, and the dignity and grace with which he led will be sorely missed in a world which needs these characteristics more than ever.\"\n\nBefore becoming Secretary-General, Annan joined the UN system in 1962 as an administrative officer with the World Health Organization in Geneva. He later served with the Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa, the UN Emergency Force in Ismailia, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva, and in several senior posts at its headquarters in New York.\n\nAnnan's tenure as Secretary-General, which began six years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and also covered the 9/11 attacks and subsequent US-led war against Iraq, was one of the UN's most turbulent periods since its founding in 1945. His tenure at the UN was tarnished by a 2005 investigation of Annan and his son over the \"oil-for-food\" scandal.\n\nAn inquiry cleared Annan of any serious wrongdoing, but found ethical and management lapses linked to his son's ties with a Swiss company that won lucrative contracts in the oil-for-food scheme. Annan later admitted that the scandal had sorely tested his mettle not only as Secretary-General, but as a father.\n\nIn his final speech as Secretary-General in December 2006, Annan delivered a parting shot at the administration of George W. Bush, accusing the US of committing human rights abuses in the name of fighting terrorism. He acknowledged more recently that the UN still had its faults, stating, \"The UN can be improved, it is not perfect, but if it didn't exist, you would have to create it.\"",
    " Title: Obama Authorizes Direct Action in Iraq to Prevent Humanitarian Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has authorized direct military action in Iraq following a coordinated offensive by the Sunni fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) that posed a threat to both American personnel and facilities, as well as the potential genocide of the Yazidi religious minority.\n\nOn Thursday night, Obama announced the authorization of direct action, allowing U.S. military warplanes based in the Middle East to attack ISIL. The threat of a deadly attack on the Kurdish capital of Erbil, home to U.S. allies and diplomats, and the systematic murder of tens of thousands of Yazidis, prompted the president's decision.\n\nThe U.S. military warplanes have not attacked as of early Friday, but the situation is rapidly evolving, and it is unclear when such strikes might occur. \"If we see actions anywhere in Iraq that threaten our personnel or facilities, we stand prepared to take targeted action to protect them,\" one senior administration official said. Obama and other White House officials emphasized that no scenario would involve large numbers of combat troops returning to Iraq.\n\nObama has tried to avoid \"kinetic\" military action since Mosul and much of Iraq's north fell to ISIL last month. The U.S. wants Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki out of the picture, and White House press secretary Josh Earnest stated earlier Thursday that the U.S. did not want any government in Baghdad to be able to take refuge behind American military power.\n\nHowever, as the danger for atrocities has grown, Obama made clear on Thursday night that the U.S. cannot stand idly by. \"When we face a situation like we do on that mountain \u2014 with innocent people facing the prospect of violence on a horrific scale, when we have a mandate to help \u2014 in this case, a request from the Iraqi government \u2014 and when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America can not turn a blind eye,\" Obama said. \"We can act, carefully and responsibly, to prevent a potential act of genocide. That's what we're doing on that mountain.\"\n\nThree Air Force cargo planes dropped food and water to help the Yazidis sustain their position, and the Defense Department is ready to launch another airdrop if required. Two Navy F/A-18 Hornet fighters escorted the cargo aircraft, and a defense official made clear that the fighters would be ready in case ISIL tried to target the resupply aircraft.\n\nThe exact air defense capabilities of the Sunni fighters have been a question mark as American officials in Washington have considered how or whether to use American air power in Iraq. The U.S. never sold Iraq shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, officials say, but they do not know what kind of Iraqi or other weapons ISIL obtained when it scattered Iraq's army in June, or what weapons it has been able to export from its other theater of operations in Syria.\n\nEven as national security officials made clear their readiness to resupply and attack if ordered, White House officials also tried to convey that Obama's orders were narrowly focused. \"We are not launching a sustained campaign against ISIL here,\" said one. The overall administration message remained the same: The U.S. cannot bomb its way out of the Iraq crisis. Only Baghdad can end the dilemma by forming an inclusive government, officials insisted, one that will enfranchise Iraq's Sunnis and other minorities and entice them to turn away from extremist forces like ISIL.\n\n\"An enduring solution to the persistent threat posed by ISIL will require further reconciliation among Iraqi communities and strengthened Iraqi security forces,\" said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. However, the White House also acknowledged that even if Baghdad overcame its political dysfunction, its military would still face a daunting task in trying to retake the territory ISIL has claimed \u2014 something the Pentagon believes it could not do without American military help.\n\n\"Nobody believes this is something you can just turn around overnight,\" said one senior administration official.\n\nObama's critics in Congress were not mollified by the president's decisions. Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, two outspoken Republican hawks, criticized what they called the president's policy of \"half measures.\"\n\n\"We need a strategic approach, not just a humanitarian one,\" they said. \"A policy of containment will not work against ISIS. It is inherently expansionist and must be stopped. The longer we wait to act, the worse this threat will become, as recent events clearly show.\"\n\nMcCain and Graham joined other conservative critics who charged that Obama's policy of disengagement in the Middle East has caused the crises in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere to get steadily worse as they fester without strong American action.\n\n\"If ever there were a time to reevaluate our disastrous policy in the Middle East, this is it,\" they said. \"Because of the President's hands-off approach, the threats in the region have grown and now directly threaten the United States. We are already paying a very heavy price for our inaction, and if we do not change course, the costs of our inaction will only grow.\"",
    " Title: Congress of 2013 on Track to Become Least Productive in History\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 113th United States Congress is on track to become the least productive Congress in history, with only 49 laws enacted so far, a figure not reached since at least 1947. This low productivity is partially attributed to the strained relationship between President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans, which has led to the first government shutdown in 17 years and flirtations with a historic debt default.\n\nThe slow pace of legislating comes despite significant issues facing the nation, such as a $17 trillion debt, the potential for a second government shutdown in mid-January, the bumpy rollout of the health care law, and overseas threats from countries like Iran. The inaction on a new farm bill is expected to disrupt rural America and cause milk prices to rise. Even legislation that seems to appeal to both parties, such as an immigration overhaul, remains stalled.\n\nSenate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) commented, \"If I look at the last 12 weeks, we can count on one hand what we\u2019ve achieved.\" He added, \"We put the government back in business thank goodness, but beyond that the strategic helium reserve bill is really the centerpiece of what we\u2019ve done.\"\n\nDespite the low productivity, there is still a glimmer of hope for some major bills to pass, including the overdue overhaul of farm policies, the annual defense policy bill, the comprehensive immigration bill, a budget deal, and an omnibus spending package. However, the farm bill's chances for passage this year have taken a significant hit, and the emotional politics of an immigration overhaul may derail it next year. Any budget deal is expected to be limited in scope.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) expressed concern that the defense bill could join the list of proposals that fail in the 113th Congress, despite the annual Pentagon authorization measure passing Congress every year for the last 51 years. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) added, \"I just think after today, legislating\u2019s going to be pretty tough.\"\n\nPart of the problem is the lack of coordination between the schedules of the GOP-controlled House and the Democratic-led Senate, making bicameral meetings and consensus-building sessions more challenging. The Senate has been in session for legislative business on only seven Fridays in 2013. The House is expected to be out for just one week before adjourning for the year on Dec. 13, while the Senate begins a two-week recess.",
    " Title: CNN Poll Shows 2014 Midterm Elections Tightening, Obama's Approval Hits All-Time Low\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CNN poll indicates that the 2014 midterm elections are now a toss-up, with the Republican Party marginally ahead of the Democratic Party by 49% to 47%. This represents a significant 10-point swing in public opinion compared to a month ago, when Democrats held a comfortable lead of 50% to 42%.\n\nThe poll results serve as a reminder that voter sentiment can be volatile and is influenced by current events. The rise of President Barack Obama's coalition, often perceived as unbeatable, is not a historical inevitability but a product of temporary trends.\n\nIn the past, the narrative was that the Republican Party had proven itself incapable of governing wisely and, consequently, of winning elections. The party's attempt to use the government shutdown to delay the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was met with criticism for prioritizing partisanship over national interests.\n\nThe shutdown's aftermath saw a decline in the Republican Party's approval ratings across all demographics. According to the poll, eight in ten voters disapproved of the shutdown, including two in three Republicans or independents who lean Republican.\n\nHowever, the Democratic Party's triumphalism was short-lived. The latest polling showing a turnaround was prefigured by two election results that demonstrated residual conservative strength. In one, Chris Christie won a landslide victory, making significant inroads into traditionally Democratic demographics such as women, Hispanics, and African-Americans. In another, an unpopular ultraconservative Republican, Ken Cuccinelli, lost his gubernatorial race in Virginia but only by a small margin, despite being heavily outspent.\n\nChristie's victory was likely due to his personal appeal to voters, but the outcome of the Virginia contest may have been influenced by public frustration over the botched rollout of the Obamacare exchanges. The website's troubles and the discovery that millions could lose their existing coverage, contrary to the President's repeated assurances, may have contributed to the public's disillusionment with the Democratic Party.\n\nIn conclusion, the National Journal reports that \"race-by-race polling conducted over the last month has painted a grim picture of the difficult environment Senate Democrats are facing next year.\" The poll results suggest that the health care issue, with its direct impact on voters' lives, may have a greater long-term resonance and could potentially sway the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nThe key word in the data seems to be \"volatility.\" Voters are disillusioned with Congress and disappointed in President Obama. The outcome of the elections will depend on events and good timing. The idea that Barack Obama established a new New Deal coalition in 2012 that cannot be broken by conservative politicians is clearly not supported by the data.",
    " Title: Samsung Develops AI System to Create Deepfake Videos with Minimal Data\n\nArticle:\n\nSamsung has developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) system that can generate deepfake videos using as little as one photograph. The technology, which was detailed in a paper earlier this week, can create convincing forgeries by using machine learning to fabricate a moving, speaking human.\n\nThe technology, if used maliciously, could potentially lead to misinformation, election tampering, and fraud, according to Hany Farid, a Dartmouth researcher who specializes in media forensics to root out deepfakes. The rapid development of such techniques, which require less and less data and are generating more and more sophisticated content, raises concerns about the ease of mass deception due to the difficulty in debunking deepfakes.\n\nDeepfake software produces forgeries by using machine learning to convincingly fabricate a moving, speaking human. Though computer manipulation of video has existed for decades, deepfake systems have made doctored clips not only easier to create but also harder to detect.\n\nThe Samsung system uses a trick that seems inspired by Alexander Graham Bell's famous quote about preparation being the key to success. The system starts with a lengthy \"meta-learning stage\" in which it watches lots of videos to learn how human faces move. It then applies what it's learned to a single still or a small handful of pictures to produce a reasonably realistic video clip.\n\nUnlike a true deepfake video, the results from a single or small number of images end up fudging fine details. For example, a fake of Marilyn Monroe in the Samsung lab's demo video missed the icon's famous mole. It also means the synthesized videos tend to retain some semblance of whoever played the role of the digital puppet, according to Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor at the University at Albany in New York who specializes in media forensics and machine learning. That's why each of the moving Mona Lisa faces looks like a slightly different person.\n\nGenerally, a deepfake system aims at eliminating those visual hiccups. That requires meaningful amounts of training data for both the input video and the target person. The few-shot or one-shot aspect of this approach is useful, Lyu said, because it means a large network can be trained on a large number of videos, which is the part that takes a long time. This kind of system can then quickly adapt to a new target person using only a few images without extensive retraining, he said. \"This saves time in concept and makes the model generalizable.\"\n\nThe rapid advancement of artificial intelligence means that any time a researcher shares a breakthrough in deepfake creation, bad actors can begin scraping together their own jury-rigged tools to mimic it. Samsung's techniques are likely to find their way into more people's hands before long. The glitches in the fake videos made with Samsung's new approach may be clear and obvious. But they'll be cold comfort to anybody who ends up in a deepfake generated from that one smiling photo posted to Facebook.",
    " Title: Parliamentary Committee Warns of \"Democratic Crisis\" in the UK, Calls for Tougher Regulation of Social Media Companies\n\nArticle:\n\nA parliamentary committee has warned of a \"democratic crisis\" in the United Kingdom, with voters being targeted with \"pernicious views\" and data being manipulated. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee, which has been investigating disinformation and fake news following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, is set to release its first report, according to a leaked copy obtained by Dominic Cummings, the director of the official Brexit campaign group Vote Leave.\n\nIn the report, MPs suggest that social media companies should face tougher regulation or a new tax. The report comes after months of investigating the impact of technology giants and how people are affected by the rise in fake news on social media. It also probed whether Russia had a role in influencing voters in the EU referendum.\n\nThe leaked report, which was due to be officially published on Sunday, is expected to be very critical of Facebook, which has been under increased scrutiny following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The report alleges that Facebook has hampered the committee's efforts to obtain information about the company throughout the inquiry.\n\nThe committee's report will also say it had received \"disturbing evidence\" of hacking, disinformation, and voter suppression in elections since 2010. It urges the government to ensure that the National Crime Agency thoroughly investigates these allegations.\n\nThe report is expected to call for clear legal liability for tech companies to act against harmful and illegal content on their platforms. It will suggest creating a \"new category of tech company\" that is something in between a platform or publisher, to establish legal accountability for tech companies.\n\nThe rules on political campaigns should be made fit for the digital age, the report will say. The committee will call for a public register for political advertising, so that anybody can see what messages are being distributed online. Online political advertisements should have a digital imprint stating who was responsible, as is required with printed leaflets and advertisements.\n\nThe report will also warn that social media sites should be held responsible for interference in elections by malicious actors. Electoral fraud fines should be increased from a maximum of \u00a320,000 to a percentage of an organization's annual turnover. An independent body such as the Competition and Markets Authority should audit the social networks, and security mechanisms and algorithms used by social networks should be available for audit by a government regulator.\n\nThe committee will also warn that fake accounts on sites such as Facebook and Twitter \"not only damage the user experience, but potentially defraud advertisers\" who could be paying to advertise to accounts not run by real people.\n\nThe report will suggest a tax on tech companies to fund education and regulation. Some of the money should fund the extra responsibilities of the regulators, while the rest should be spent on digital education in schools and a public awareness campaign to help people identify disinformation and fake news.\n\nThe report will summarize the evidence collected during the committee's inquiry, which was launched in September last year. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie and Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix were among the 61 witnesses that gave evidence.\n\nTom Baldwin, who has written a book on the relationship between politics and media, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the report's recommendations did not go far enough. Will Moy, the head of fact-checking charity Full Fact, and Jamie Bartlett, the head of think tank Demos, also shared their views on the report's implications. The final report is expected before the end of the year. Facebook and Twitter have yet to respond to a request for comment.",
    " Title: Government Shutdown Affects Death Gratuity Benefits for Families of Fallen Service Members\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing partial government shutdown has resulted in the Department of Defense announcing that it would be unable to pay the $100,000 death gratuity benefit to support families of the fallen. This decision, which was met with quick condemnation from various sectors, has left many questioning the sincerity of the government's support for America's troops and veterans.\n\nThe death gratuity benefit is a financial assistance provided to the families of service members who die while on active duty or as a result of a service-related injury. The news of the benefit's temporary suspension has caused distress among the military and veterans community, as well as pundits.\n\nPoliticians from both parties have rushed to denounce the decision and call for the benefits to be reinstated. The strong bipartisan support for the issue has led veterans to question the genuine nature of the government's support, with some speculating that the pledges of support may serve as a symbolic fallback issue for legislators during tough governing times.\n\nFortunately, the military charity Fisher House Foundation has stepped up and will cover these benefits for the Pentagon until the problem is solved.\n\nThe shutdown's impact on veterans and military families extends beyond the death gratuity benefit. Veterans and military families are left to wonder if the pledges of support are genuine or merely symbolic. The shutdown has also affected veterans who make up 27% of the federal workforce, who are now furloughed. National Guard drills are being rescheduled or canceled in many states, affecting troop readiness and pay. On base, services that military families count on are now closed. Veterans who rely on disability and GI Bill benefits are facing the very real possibility of not getting their benefits next month, as Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki testified Wednesday.\n\nThe political games and posturing surrounding the shutdown have generated a style of bandwagon politics that is getting stale. Rather than focus on solving the problems that resulted in the shutdown, politicians are conveniently highlighting veterans and military families without doing the one job that will really help: ending the shutdown. The political games and posturing need to end, and solutions need to be found to help veterans and military families who are hurting during the shutdown.",
    " Title: Republican-Led State Legislatures Advance Conservative Agenda, Stripping LGBT Rights and Limiting Social Services\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican lawmakers in North Carolina recently passed a bill, known as House Bill 2, that restricts transgender individuals from using bathrooms that align with their gender identity and prevents local governments from outlawing discrimination against LGBT citizens. The bill, which has been criticized as one of the most anti-LGBT rights laws in the country, was vetoed by Governor Nathan Deal of Georgia after intervention from corporate actors, including Disney and the NFL.\n\nThe bill's passage in North Carolina is indicative of a larger divide in the United States, with Republican-controlled states advancing conservative agendas that limit civil rights and social services, while Democratic-controlled states strengthen protections and expand social services.\n\nIn the past six years, Republican control of state governments has led to a number of changes in red states. Abortion restrictions, such as the recent ban on abortions in cases of fetal disability in Indiana and the end of state funding for preventive health services at medical centers where abortions occur in Florida, are becoming more common in states with Republican governors or legislatures.\n\nIn addition, 19 states have yet to accept Medicaid expansion, a key component of Obamacare, with either a Republican governor or a GOP-controlled legislature. Voting restrictions, such as voter ID laws, early voting restrictions, and the elimination of same-day registration, are also more common in states controlled by Republicans.\n\nIn contrast, blue states are more likely to have generous Medicaid and welfare benefits, well-funded public schools, and supportive programs for child care, family leave, foster care, and the homeless and disabled. California recently became the first state to raise its minimum wage to $15, and a similar effort is underway in New York.\n\nExamples of the impact of Republican dominance on the state level can be seen in Kansas and Louisiana, where new governors have prioritized tax cuts for the highest earners, leading to devastating consequences for state agencies, youth services, mental health treatment, and higher education.\n\nEven in purple or blue states, once Republicans take control of state government, they have wasted little time in pushing through conservative agendas, including restricting abortion rights, privatizing public services, and undermining labor protections.\n\nAs the nation's politics become more divided, ideologically orthodox conservative Republicans are aggressively pushing their agenda on the state level. The consequences for those living in red state America could be dire.",
    " Title: Boehner Denies Plans for Impeachment of President Obama; House GOP Focuses on Lawsuit Against White House\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has denied that congressional Republicans are moving to impeach President Barack Obama, labeling such talk as a \"scam started by Democrats at the White House.\" During a meeting with GOP members on Tuesday, Boehner stated, \"We have no plans to impeach the President. We have no future plans.\"\n\nBoehner attributed the discussion of impeachment to \"the President's own staff\" and congressional Democrats, stating that they are using the issue to rally support for the upcoming elections. Boehner's decision to sue Obama was designed to address outrage from tea party activists and others within the GOP base over a string of Obama executive orders they say circumvented Congress.\n\nThe lawsuit covers his decision last year to defer a health law requirement that businesses provide insurance coverage to their employees. However, the suit also opened the door to more discussion about impeaching the second-straight Democratic president by a Republican-led House.\n\nThe issue was magnified when incoming House GOP whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana refused to take the issue off the table during an interview over the weekend. Dan Pfeiffer, a longtime aide and senior Obama adviser, stated last week that impeachment talk should not be considered a long shot. Pfeiffer said that the lawsuit was evidence Republicans would consider impeachment down the road.\n\nCongressional Democrats have seized on the issue and show no sign of letting up. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid raised the subject on the Senate floor on Tuesday at about the same time Boehner was ruling it out. \"Look in the papers today, the American people are totally opposed to this,\" Reid said. \"We should not be off on those tracks of impeachment and suing the President. We should be legislating.\"\n\nIn the month since Boehner announced his lawsuit, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has raised nearly $7.6 million ahead of the November midterms. However, the campaign arm has pulled in $1 million alone since Scalise's comments on impeachment over the weekend. With the resolution to formally authorize the lawsuit expected on the House floor on Wednesday, House Democrats are likely to continue to argue, regardless of Boehner's comments, that that move is simply the first step toward impeachment.",
    " Title: Telecom Industry Challenges Maine's Broadband User Privacy Law in Court\n\nArticle:\n\nThe telecom industry, following its successful lobbying to eliminate federal consumer privacy rules, has now filed a lawsuit against the state of Maine over its new broadband user privacy law. The lawsuit, filed this week, claims that the Maine law violates the industry's free speech rights.\n\nThe Maine law, passed last June, requires Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to clearly disclose the data they collect and with whom they share it. The law also mandates that users opt in to the sale of sensitive location or financial data and prohibits ISPs from charging extra for privacy protection.\n\nThe lawsuit, first spotted by Ars Technica, argues that Maine's law \"imposes unprecedented and unduly burdensome restrictions on ISPs' protected speech.\" The lawsuit further claims that the law's requirements for disclosure and opt-in are discriminatory, as they apply only to ISPs while ignoring similar data practices of other online and offline businesses.\n\nTelecom experts, however, view the industry's lawsuit as a desperate attempt to dodge accountability for a decade of telecom-related privacy abuses. Gigi Sohn, a former FCC lawyer, told Motherboard that the lawsuit is part of a broader industry effort to eliminate all meaningful state and federal consumer protections.\n\nSohn noted that the lawsuit is a response to the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) apathy towards consumer protection, which allowed ISPs to engage in practices such as charging consumers rental fees for modems they already own or increasing subscriber bills through bogus fees and surcharges.\n\nIn 2017, telecom lobbyists convinced the Trump FCC to not only kill net neutrality but also eliminate most of the FCC's telecom consumer protection authority. The FCC's inaction has allowed ISPs to engage in practices that violate consumer privacy.\n\nIn response to federal apathy, states like Washington, California, and Maine have passed their own privacy and net neutrality laws. The industry has complained that this creates a confusing \"patchwork quilt\" of state consumer protections, but Sohn argues that this problem is self-inflicted, as the industry lobbied to repeal the FCC's broadband privacy rules.\n\nBlake Reid, Associate Clinical Professor at Colorado Law, told Motherboard that the industry's lawsuit is another example of the sector trying to have its cake and eat it too. Reid noted that the industry's argument that the near-total vacuum of privacy protections at the federal level conflicts with Maine's law is disingenuous, as the industry lobbied to repeal the FCC's broadband privacy rules.\n\nWith former Verizon lawyers now in charge of both the FCC and the Department of Justice, the federal government has further aided the telecom sector by suing states like California for attempting to protect consumers on issues like net neutrality. Reid stated that it is no surprise that states like Maine have stepped in to fill the void, and the industry can hardly claim that having to protect their customers' privacy conflicts with their non-obligations to do essentially nothing at all under federal law.",
    " Title: The Evolution of Liberal Approaches to Free Speech and Political Discourse\n\nArticle:\n\nIn recent years, the concept of free speech has become a topic of significant debate, with some arguing that it has become a predominantly conservative idea due to the perceived lack of commitment to it among liberals. This article explores seven strategies that some liberals are said to employ to silence or discredit opposing viewpoints, as described in the provided text.\n\n1. Libsplaining: This phenomenon involves liberals interpreting conservative viewpoints in a way that is often at odds with the original intent. For example, opposition to welfare might be misconstrued as hatred towards certain demographics, or a lack of support for a particular political candidate could be seen as a desire for a fascist regime.\n\n2. Violence: Some liberals are accused of resorting to violence to silence their political opponents, particularly in the context of protests. Groups such as Antifa have been involved in violent demonstrations against individuals and organizations with differing political beliefs, ranging from far-right extremists to mainstream conservatives.\n\n3. De-Platforming: This strategy involves limiting the dissemination of conservative viewpoints by controlling access to media outlets, social media platforms, and other forums for public discourse. This can be seen in the increasing hostility towards conservatives on Twitter, Facebook, Google, and YouTube, as these platforms become less welcoming to conservative voices.\n\n4. Political Correctness, Safe Spaces, and Microaggressions: These concepts are used to silence individuals expressing opinions that liberals find unacceptable. For example, a conservative employee at Google was fired for making scientifically supported arguments about women in STEM fields that were deemed offensive by liberals.\n\n5. Liberal Fakes: In the mainstream media, there is a perceived lack of genuine conservative representation. Many conservative voices in the media are seen as moderate at best and liberal at worst, serving to give the impression that even conservatives disagree with conservative policies.\n\n6. False Labeling: Liberals are accused of labeling their political opponents as white supremacists, Nazis, fascists, or racists, even when the evidence for such labels is tenuous or non-existent.\n\n7. The Ventriloquist Dummy: Liberals are said to use certain individuals, often those who have experienced tragedy or are perceived as innocent and sympathetic, to advance their political agendas. These individuals, such as Cindy Sheehan, the Parkland students, and even former President Barack Obama, are used to shield their arguments from criticism, particularly when the individuals in question are people of color.\n\nIt is essential to note that this article presents the strategies described as they are perceived by some, and it does not aim to endorse or condemn these tactics. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the strategies that some liberals are said to employ to silence or discredit opposing viewpoints, as described in the provided text.",
    " Title: NPR Battleground Map: Hillary Clinton Gains Significant Lead Over Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest NPR analysis of polling, demographics, and on-the-ground reporting indicates that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has solidified a substantial lead over Republican candidate Donald Trump. If the election were held today, Clinton would win in a landslide of 2008 proportions, with 273 electoral votes, according to the NPR Battleground Map.\n\nClinton's leads in key battleground states have grown, and she could potentially win without capturing any of the toss-up states, such as Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada, and Georgia. In the map provided, Clinton would secure a victory with 273 electoral votes to Trump's 174.\n\nTrump's campaign has been marred by a series of missteps, including feuds with families of fallen soldiers, declining to support key Republicans, controversial remarks, and a lack of support from some traditionally Republican demographics. These missteps have reportedly led key voting groups to move more toward Clinton, particularly white, college-educated voters in suburban areas.\n\nThe past month has been challenging for any Republican hoping for Trump's victory, with the current state of the race being reminiscent of Barack Obama's 2008 margin of 365-173 over John McCain. However, it is important to note that few things are likely to remain constant almost three months out from Election Day, and this analysis is a snapshot of the current state of the race.\n\nThe next significant opportunities for Trump to change the dynamics are the debates, with the first scheduled for September 26 on Long Island, New York, followed by the vice presidential debate on October 4 in Virginia, the second presidential debate on October 9 in St. Louis, and the final debate 10 days later in Las Vegas.\n\nThe NPR Battleground Map also shows that several traditionally red states have moved in Clinton's direction. Georgia has been moved to Tossup from Lean R, Utah to Lean R from Likely R, and one electoral vote in Nebraska to Tossup from Lean R. In Georgia, Obama only lost by 5 points in 2008, and some polls are showing Clinton in the lead, although both candidates are only in the low 40s.\n\nIn Utah, another poll showed Clinton and Trump within a couple of points of each other, with a significant number of undecided voters. The impact of third-party candidate Gary Johnson is a key question in Utah, as well as in other states. If Johnson can garner high teen or 20-point support, there could be a path for Clinton to win Utah.\n\nIn Nebraska, the state splits its votes by congressional district, with Obama winning the Omaha-area district in 2008. The Democratic House incumbent Brad Ashford is favored there, and Omaha-based billionaire Warren Buffett is reportedly planning to help Clinton in the area.\n\nDespite Trump's recent struggles, he has held steady in a couple of states that were previously considered Lean D, such as Florida and Nevada. Both states have moved to Tossup as more polling data has become available. Given demographics and Clinton's turnout operation, both states could be considered favorable for Clinton. However, the Republican National Committee (RNC) has moved staff to Florida to try to save the state.\n\nThe NPR Battleground Map also shows that several states previously considered Safe R, such as Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming, remain in Trump's column. Meanwhile, Safe D states, such as California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, D.C., Washington state, and Wisconsin, remain in Clinton's column.\n\nOverall, the NPR Battleground Map suggests that Clinton currently holds a significant lead over Trump, but the race is likely to evolve in the coming months, particularly in the wake of the upcoming debates.",
    " Title: Genetic Similarities Between Humans and Primates and the Struggle Between Human Nature and Behavior\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the science fiction novel Dune, an old witch suggests that a young nobleman may be human, implying a close relationship between humans and animals. This statement is supported by genetic research, as approximately 97 percent of the human genome is identical to that of orangutans, which are solitary and pacifistic, and about 99 percent of our DNA is identical to that of chimpanzees, which are intensely social and fierce. The genetic difference between orangutan and chimpanzee is relatively small, and the genetic difference between chimpanzee and Homo sapiens is tiny indeed.\n\nRecent events have highlighted the inner chimp in human behavior, as demonstrated by an incident involving Ivanka Trump, daughter of the president-elect, on a JetBlue airliner at JFK airport in New York. A fellow by the name of Matthew Lasner, a professor at New York's Hunter College, tweeted that his husband had spied Ivanka Trump and her child on a flight and was \"chasing them down to harass them.\" His husband, Daniel Goldstein, apparently did just that, berating the mother and child until he and his husband were escorted off the airplane.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder of the inner chimp that exists within each individual, and the struggle between the better angels of our nature and our baser instincts. It is essential to recognize that we are called to be something more than our emotions, appetites, and allegiances.\n\nManners are a misunderstood thing, not about aesthetics or making oneself a more pleasant dining companion, but about making other people feel valued, respected, and considered. The point of manners is to keep the peace, to prevent violence, suppression, and misery, which were all most of the human race knew until the day before yesterday, when the emergence of market capitalism taught us how to cooperate with one another and the Industrial Revolution gave us the means to do so on a grand scale.\n\nPolitics always brings out tribalism, and this year's election has been more tribalistic than most. Witness how the 80-odd percent of Republicans who opposed bailouts when they were done by Barack Obama reversed course and became the 80-odd percent of Republicans who support bailouts when organized by Donald Trump. It is essential to recognize that we are called to be more, to be human, to be morally and spiritually larger than what lies within our own skins. And if that is beyond one's personal capacity, one is in luck. One doesn't have to be a saint. All one really has to do is to mind one's manners and one can pass for human most of the time.",
    " Title: Social Media and the \"Spiral of Silence\": A Study on Public Opinion Sharing\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by the Pew Research Internet Project suggests that social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter do not provide a platform for those hesitant to speak up in public on policy issues when they feel their views are in the minority. The study, which surveyed 1,801 adults, focused on the divisive public issue of Edward Snowden's NSA revelations, revealing that people were less willing to discuss the surveillance online than they were in person.\n\nThe study found that people were more likely to speak up online if they believed others agreed with them. Those who frequently used Facebook and Twitter were less likely to share their opinions offline. For instance, a person who checks Facebook multiple times a day is half as likely to share their opinion offline as someone who does not go on the site as frequently.\n\nThe report attributes this phenomenon to what it refers to as the \"spiral of silence.\" However, it acknowledges that the study's focus on one policy issue may not fully capture the complexity of the issue, and that other factors, such as confidence in one's knowledge and opinions, also play a role.\n\nThe report suggests several theories as to why social media perpetuates the \"spiral of silence.\" These include fear of isolation, a desire to avoid losing friends and alienating people, and the observation that those with minority opinions on social media platforms may experience ostracism, which could increase the perceived risk of opinion sharing in other settings.\n\nWhile the report's theories provide insight into the issue, it is also possible that the problem isn't the \"spiral of silence\" but rather the overwhelming noise and repetition of the same views on social media. Those who spend a significant amount of time online reading the same views, over and over again, on the same topic, may be tired of hearing it and may not want to contribute to the cacophonic chorus telling itself, over and over again, how right it is, both online and off.",
    " Title: Boko Haram Hostage-Taking in Nigeria Highlights Growing Terrorist Threat in North Africa\n\nArticle:\n\nThe kidnapping of hundreds of schoolgirls in Nigeria by the militant group Boko Haram has brought to light the increasing strength and influence of Islamic militants operating in the region between the Sahara and sub-Saharan Africa. The Boko Haram terrorists have developed paramilitary capabilities and have expanded their operations beyond Nigeria's Muslim north, posing a growing threat to the country.\n\nThe current hostage-taking incident, which has resulted in the largest and most violent example of Boko Haram's growing strength, is not the first such incident. In January 2013, terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda attacked a natural gas production facility near the town of In Amenas in Algeria, holding over 800 people hostage. The terrorists executed some 40 foreigners before Algerian authorities re-established control, killing nearly 30 terrorists as the rest escaped. The incident occurred during President Obama's second inauguration, resulting in minimal American press coverage.\n\nShortly thereafter, in Mali, terrorists, many formerly employed by Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, nearly took over the entire country. Repeated military interventions by France in its former colony prevented an Islamist victory. The situation in Mali remains far from secure even today.\n\nThe growing terrorist threat across North Africa has received little attention in the United States. In 2012, terrorists assassinated Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in Libya on Sept. 11, but there has been no retaliation against the growing terrorist threat in Libya.\n\nThe United States needs an effective counterterrorism strategy in North Africa, and it currently lacks one. Despite having created a separate African Command at the Pentagon, separating it from the European Command, inadequate attention has been given to the North African terrorist threat.\n\nThe Nigerian government has not dealt effectively with Boko Haram, and other governments in the region also face severe constraints on their operational capabilities. The failure of the Nigerian government to contain Boko Haram has significant political implications throughout northern Africa. If Boko Haram's reach and strength continue to grow, it is not impossible that Nigeria's ethnically and religiously diverse population could face massive internal strife, and perhaps even split apart. The 1967 Biafra secession and subsequent civil war and humanitarian tragedy should remind us just how fragile Nigeria actually is.\n\nIf there is instability in Nigeria, and the Nigerian national government loses control over northern Nigeria because of it, it could become a haven for terrorist groups operating worldwide. Northern Africa is much closer to the West than the Al Qaeda and Taliban bases in the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nThe Obama administration's initial decision to offer assistance from the FBI, while laudable, nonetheless betrays its continuing belief that global terrorism can be handled as a law-enforcement matter rather than the war it truly is. Much more is needed, and not just piecemeal assistance, even from America's military and intelligence agencies.\n\nNeither the Obama administration nor our country as a whole is paying adequate attention. The threat of Islamic terrorism on display now in northern Nigeria is global in scope and continues to grow, political rhetoric by the president notwithstanding. Boko Haram's latest outrage should focus our attention on the continuing threat of Al Qaeda and radical Islam. Whether we pay attention remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Young American Voter Turnout for Midterms Remains Low, Concerns for Democratic \"Blue Wave\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA new survey by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic has revealed that only one in three young Americans (ages 18-29) are certain they will vote in the upcoming November midterm elections. This is in stark contrast to the expected turnout for older age groups, with 81% of seniors (Americans age 65+) surveyed stating they will vote in the midterms.\n\nThe survey, conducted from August 24 to September 13, polled 1,811 Americans over the age of 18. Although participants were randomly selected, the survey over-sampled voters aged 18-29 to gather more data from this age group. The survey had a margin of error of 3%.\n\nThe survey's findings could potentially dampen Democrats' hopes for a \"blue wave\" in the 2018 midterms, as midterm elections typically report low voter turnout. In the 2014 midterms, about 36% of Americans eligible to vote did so, according to the United States Election Project.\n\nRobert P. Jones, CEO of PRRI, stated that young voters are an important demographic for Democrats, as they support Democratic candidates over Republican candidates by a margin of 61% to 35%.\n\nResearchers attribute young Americans' low turnout to various reasons, with Robert Griffin, associate director of research at PRRI, highlighting a lack of information as a significant factor. \"We have norms in society not just about being a voter, but being an informed voter,\" Griffin said. \"If you have a portion of the society that judges itself uninformed, that will potentially have an effect on their likelihood of voting.\"\n\nAnother potential reason for low turnout, according to Griffin, is a belief among young Americans that voting may not cause change. While 78% of seniors polled for the survey said voting regularly is the \"most effective way to create change,\" only 50% of young Americans surveyed agreed.\n\nGriffin noted that the current turnout rate for young voters in November looks consistent with 2014, which was \"one of the lowest turnout years for young voters probably in the last three decades.\" However, he also stated that this does not necessarily spell disaster for Democrats, citing special elections since 2016 that have \"indicated large swings to the left.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the survey's findings suggest that young American voter turnout for the 2018 midterms may remain low, potentially impacting the anticipated \"blue wave\" of Democratic victories. However, the survey's results do not necessarily predict the entire election cycle, as special elections since 2016 have shown significant swings to the left.",
    " Title: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan Renews Push for Obamacare Repeal\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has renewed his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Ryan, who is a potential 2016 presidential contender, discussed his plan to balance the budget in a decade, which includes the repeal of Obamacare, during an interview on Fox News Sunday.\n\nRyan's plan to repeal Obamacare is a recurring theme in his political career. He has consistently advocated for its repeal in previous budget proposals and during the 2012 campaign trail. The Republican Party has attempted to repeal Obamacare more than 30 times, with the latest attempt being a measure introduced by Rep. Michele Bachmann in the current session.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the law in a politically charged decision last year. A poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation after the November presidential election found that just 33% of those polled support repealing Obamacare. Even House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, acknowledged after the election that the GOP's mission to repeal the law would change.\n\nRyan is expected to release his budget this week, providing a preview of his plan on Wednesday. His continued push for Obamacare repeal, despite the political challenges, is seen as a strategic move to appeal to the most conservative members of the Republican base should he decide to run for president in 2016.\n\nPolitical experts suggest that Ryan's stance on Obamacare is a bargaining position and a tactic to gain the Republican nomination in 2016. John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University, stated, \"I don't think it's necessarily a surprise. It's where he stood before the election, and it's a bargaining position. Also, it's a classic position to take if in 2016 if he wants to run for president. He knows it's not very realistic to try to repeal Obamacare, but it's a good way to try and get the nomination in 2016.\"\n\nRyan is also dealing with two political realities, according to Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. \"He's trying to appeal to several audiences,\" Gonzales said. \"There's trying to get something done, but there's also appealing to the party's base.\"\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, D-Washington, is expected to soon unveil a budget that will likely include an increase in taxes for wealthy Americans and businesses while cutting some spending as a way of addressing the deficit. Some in the Republican base support the idea that nixing costs associated with Obamacare would help trim the deficit.\n\nLast year, the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation wrote that one such effort to repeal Obamacare \"would reduce direct spending by $890 billion and reduce revenues by $1 trillion between 2013 and 2022, thus adding $109 billion to federal budget deficits over that period.\"\n\nWhile the prospects of repealing Obamacare may be slim, Ryan's continued push for its repeal underscores the deep political divide over the law and the ongoing efforts by some Republicans to dismantle it.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the New York Times' Report on Liberty University's Reopening Amid COVID-19\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an article published on March 29th, The New York Times reported on Liberty University's decision to reopen its campus, suggesting that the school's president, Jerry Falwell Jr., had put students at risk and that a dozen students had contracted the coronavirus. However, a closer examination of the facts reveals a different story.\n\nWhile it is true that Liberty University reopened its campus, the characterization of the reopening as a broad, uncontrolled event is misleading. According to sources within the university, the reopening was targeted, focusing on foreign students who had no other place to go. Contrary to the article's claims, the university was largely deserted, with less than 1,500 out of 15,000 students remaining on campus, primarily foreign students.\n\nThe article also claimed that one student had tested positive for COVID-19 and that Dr. Eppes, a Liberty University physician, had made statements suggesting the university had lost control of the situation. However, Dr. Eppes has since come forward to deny the accuracy of the quote attributed to him.\n\nFurthermore, the article's claim that students were \"starting to get sick\" is questionable. The article does not specify the symptoms that were \"suggestive of COVID-19,\" and it is unclear whether these symptoms were unique to the coronavirus or could have been caused by other respiratory illnesses.\n\nThe New York Times' article also failed to mention that Liberty University had taken additional precautions, such as constant cleaning of frequently touched surfaces, removing two out of every three computers from the lab to ensure social distancing, and quarantining those suspected of carrying the virus in a former hotel 3 miles from campus. Two surprise visits from state health inspectors found no violations.\n\nIn response to the article, Mr. Falwell was widely criticized, and many, including the author of this article, expressed concern about the potential risks to students. However, as more facts have come to light, it appears that the initial report was factually incorrect.\n\nThe New York Times' article has been widely criticized for its inaccuracies, and some have questioned the paper's journalistic integrity. The Wall Street Journal's columnist William McGurn wrote an article titled \"The Education of Jerry Falwell Jr.: Attacked for keeping Liberty University open, he now seems to have made a good call.\" McGurn's article highlights the fact that no Liberty student living on campus tested positive, and no staffer stationed on campus tested positive.\n\nIn conclusion, the initial report by The New York Times on Liberty University's reopening appears to be factually incorrect. The university took precautions to ensure the safety of its students and staff, and there is no evidence to suggest that the reopening led to a significant number of COVID-19 cases. It is essential for journalists to report facts accurately and avoid sensationalism, especially during a global pandemic.",
    " Title: Trump Threatens to Block Financial Aid for USPS Unless Package Rates Raised\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday threatened to withhold financial aid for the United States Postal Service (USPS) unless it increases package shipping rates for retail giants like Amazon. During a meeting in the Oval Office, Trump stated, \"The postal service is a joke,\" and suggested that package shipping rates should be increased by approximately four times.\n\nThe CARES Act, which Trump signed into law last month, included a provision allowing the cash-strapped USPS to borrow up to $10 billion from the Treasury Department to cover losses during the coronavirus pandemic. However, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated on Friday that the lending plan is tied to \"postal reform.\" Trump offered more specifics, stating that he only wants to free up the money if the Postal Service raises rates.\n\nTrump reiterated his long-held belief that Amazon and other large shipping retailers are receiving too favorable rates from USPS. \"For some reason, they're very cozy with some of these companies,\" Trump said. \"If they don't raise the price, I'm not signing anything.\"\n\nLater on Friday afternoon, the president took to Twitter to praise postal service employees while criticizing the leadership of the USPS. \"I will never let our Post Office fail,\" the president tweeted. \"It has been mismanaged for years, especially since the advent of the internet and modern-day technology. The people that work there are great, and we\u2019re going to keep them happy, healthy, and well!\"\n\nTrump's sharp criticism of the post office came after he signed a $484 billion bipartisan coronavirus relief bill targeted largely at small businesses.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accused the Trump administration of trying to use its leverage over the loan to seek to privatize the USPS. She urged Americans to speak up in favor of their mail carriers, who are especially vital for delivering medicine and communications for senior citizens, she said.\n\n\"Right now I see a very big danger for our country in the form of the Trump administration's interest in privatizing the post office,\" Pelosi said on Friday. \"This is really dangerous, and Mnuchin at Treasury is trying to leverage the debt situation in a way that must be stopped.\"\n\nThe Postal Service has repeatedly defended its arrangement with Amazon.",
    " Title: US Expands Travel Ban to Include Six Additional Countries, Critics Allege Discrimination\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has expanded its travel ban, often criticized as a Muslim ban, to target citizens from six additional countries. The move, announced on Friday, has been met with criticism from immigrant advocates and critics who argue that the policy discriminates against Muslims and others.\n\nThe new restrictions will affect citizens from Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania. The Trump administration maintains that these countries failed to meet US security and information-sharing standards, necessitating the new restrictions.\n\nThe problems officials cited range from subpar passport technology to a failure to sufficiently exchange information on \"terrorism\" suspects and criminals. The restrictions on the six new countries will take effect on February 21.\n\nThe US will suspend the issuance of visas that can lead to permanent residency for nationals of Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, and Nigeria, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said on Friday. Non-immigrant visas will not be affected. According to the State Department, non-immigrant visas include those for tourism, short-term business, medical purposes, education, and journalism, among other types of visas.\n\nDuring December, for example, about 650,760 non-immigrant visas were granted worldwide. Immigrant visas include those for spouses, certain family members, certain sponsored employment, and other purposes.\n\nThe Trump administration has stated that there are exceptions to the restrictions. The US government will also stop issuing \"diversity visas\" to nationals of Sudan and Tanzania, according to a presidential proclamation. These visas, which President Trump has criticized in the past, are available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.\n\nThe State Department uses a computer drawing to select people from around the world for up to 55,000 diversity visas. Nigeria is already excluded from the lottery along with other countries that had more than 50,000 natives immigrate to the US in the previous five years.\n\nThe existing version of the ban includes the Muslim-majority nations of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. North Korea and Venezuela also face visa restrictions, but those measures affect relatively few travelers.\n\nThe current ban suspends immigrant and non-immigrant visas to applicants from the affected countries, but it allows exceptions, including for students and those who have established \"significant contacts\" in the US. The Venezuelan ban mostly affects government officials and their family members.",
    " Title: President Obama Supports Senate Democrats' Enactment of the \"Nuclear Option\" to Alter Congressional Rules\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama on Thursday expressed his support for Senate Democrats' move to implement the so-called \"nuclear option\" and alter congressional rules to expedite the confirmation of judicial and executive nominees.\n\nDuring remarks in the White House press briefing room, President Obama stated, \"Enough is enough. I'm a former senator. So is my vice president. We both value any senator's duty to advise and consent. It's important we take that very seriously. But a few now refuse to treat that duty of advise and consent with the respect it deserves...\"\n\nThe nuclear option, as described, changes Senate rules and eliminates the possibility of a filibuster for presidential nominees, allowing the White House to swiftly appoint prospective officials who, thus far, have been blocked by Republicans.\n\nThe Senate voted 52-48 earlier Thursday in favor of the controversial change, with GOP leaders vehemently objecting and casting the step as a power grab by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat.\n\nIt is important to note that the nuclear option does not extend to Supreme Court nominees. However, Republicans have vowed to utilize the new rules to push through their own high-court picks when a Republican occupies the White House in the future.\n\nThe Senate rules fight provides the White House an opportunity to shift the focus away from the ongoing controversy surrounding the botched rollout of Obamacare, which has dominated Washington for the past month. President Obama, who, as a senator, opposed the idea of the nuclear option, stated Thursday's action will help the government function more effectively and should alleviate some of the gridlock that has plagued Washington in recent years.\n\nIn related news, the White House has changed its stance on the judge standoff, now backing Senate Democrats' filibuster move, as reported in a separate article titled \"White House changes tune on judge standoff, backs Senate Dems' filibuster move.\"\n\nPresident Obama concluded, \"We can't let it become normal. So I support the step a majority of senators today took to change the way that Washington is doing business. More specifically, the way the Senate does business.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Criticism of Trump's Meeting with Putin\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing a contentious news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump faced criticism from lawmakers across the political spectrum on Tuesday. Trump, in a series of tweets, defended the meeting and blamed the media for the negative reception.\n\nWhile Trump praised his meeting with NATO leaders, he claimed that his meeting with Putin was even better. He tweeted, \"Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!\"\n\nCritics, including Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, criticized Trump for siding with Putin over U.S. intelligence officials who report that Russians interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Corker called for legislation to counter some of the president's foreign policy moves, including tariffs on imports.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was one of the few Republicans to defend the president after he accepted Putin's denials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. While taking Putin's side, Trump also condemned the ongoing investigation of Russia as a \"disaster\" driving a wedge between the United States and Russia.\n\nEven some of Trump's supporters, including former House speaker and long-time Trump backer Newt Gingrich, were dismayed by the Putin news conference. Gingrich tweeted, \"President Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin.\"\n\nAt least one Republican, former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, called on Trump to resign, stating, \"To deny your own country and government in favor of a foreign leader whose country has, for decades, tried to undermine the United States is irrational and dangerous.\"\n\nTrump defended his performance at the NATO summit in Brussels, claiming that allies are spending more money on defense at his behest. He also criticized the media and Russia while he was at it. Members of NATO, however, said they were already increasing defense spending, irrespective of Trump. They also questioned Trump's commitment to the alliance and said his critical comments about both NATO and the EU were pleasing to Putin and the Russians.\n\nVice President Mike Pence defended Trump, stating that disagreements between the countries were discussed at length, but what the world saw was that President Donald Trump will always put the prosperity and security of America first.\n\nTrump has meetings at the White House on Tuesday, but so far is not scheduled to speak publicly. One of Trump's meetings is with a group of congressional lawmakers, though the subject is tax cuts rather than Russia. Several Republicans invited to the White House meeting had, only hours earlier, rebuked Trump over his appearance with Putin.",
    " Title: Republican Leaders Boycott Medicare Cost Committee in Challenge to ObamaCare's IPAB\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move challenging a controversial element of the Affordable Care Act, the Republican leaders of the House and Senate announced on Thursday that they will boycott the Individual Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a committee created to control Medicare costs. The IPAB has been criticized by some as a \"death panel,\" though this term is less commonly used in current discussions.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, in a letter to President Obama, stated they would not recommend any nominees to the committee and reiterated their belief that it should be repealed entirely. The Republicans expressed concerns that the panel would enforce Medicare cuts by reducing payments to providers and potentially eliminating certain treatments.\n\nThe 15-member advisory board, also known as IPAB, would have the power to impose payment cuts on insurers, drug companies, and other service providers if Medicare costs rise beyond certain levels. The health care law explicitly forbids the board from rationing care, shifting costs to seniors, or cutting their benefits. However, Boehner, at a news conference on Thursday, said the members still \"have the authority to deny seniors access to care.\"\n\nIt is unclear what impact the boycott will have on the panel. The law states the president should consult with Congress on the nominations, but the president is free to make his own appointments. The members of the board are supposed to be from both parties, and nominees would be subject to Senate confirmation.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney criticized the Republican stance and their renewed efforts to repeal the health care law. \"It just demonstrates again how out of touch with what the American people want the House Republicans have become,\" Carney said. \"Instead of focusing on measures that could help us invest in innovation and manufacturing and job creation, instead of focusing on common-sense efforts to reduce our deficit in a balanced way, House Republicans are voting again to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nAsked about the repeated votes to repeal the law, Boehner said there were about 70 new members of the House this year. \"Frankly, they have been asking for an opportunity to vote on it, and we are going to give it to them,\" Boehner said. He added that he supports total repeal of the law rather than efforts to amend it as it goes into effect over the next year.\n\nRepublicans claim there have been only two previous votes to eliminate the health care law in its entirety. They say there have been more than 30 votes to partially repeal or defund the law, and several have been signed into law, including one eliminating an unpopular tax-filing requirement that would have affected millions of businesses. Economists have predicted that the Medicare board's services might not be needed in the near future because Medicare cost increases appear to be manageable.",
    " Title: U.S. Strategy Against ISIS Faces Challenges as Allied Countries Pursue Different Interests\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama met with military leaders from 21 allied countries this week to discuss the ongoing campaign against the Islamic State (ISIS) militants. The group, also known as ISIS, has been gaining ground in Iraq and Syria, prompting questions about the U.S. strategy.\n\nThe U.S. strategy against ISIS has its upsides and downsides. The upside is that the U.S. has assembled a coalition of 21 countries to combat the militants. The downside is that not all of these countries share the same interests, leading to differences in strategy and approach.\n\nIn the past month, President Obama has outlined his strategy for degrading and defeating ISIS. The U.S. and its allies have reported some successes, such as driving ISIS away from the Mosul Dam in Iraq. However, the president remains concerned about the besieged Syrian town of Kobani and parts of Iraq's Anbar province, where ISIS has been tightening its grip.\n\nCritics, such as Republican Senator John McCain, challenge the president's strategy as ISIS captures more territory in both Syria and Iraq. McCain argues that the Iraqis and the Peshmerga, the Kurdish forces, are not winning, and there needs to be a fundamental reevaluation of the U.S. strategy.\n\nMilitary analyst Anthony Cordesman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies agrees, stating that the air war has fallen short of what was done in Kosovo or Kuwait. The pace of airstrikes has been slow, with an average of 15 strikes per day, and the majority of the strikes have been against individual weapons systems.\n\nObama stresses that the campaign to defeat ISIS cannot be waged solely on military terms. The U.S. and its allies must offer political and economic alternatives to the militants. The U.S.-led military effort is being hampered by some of the same sectarian and political divisions that helped give rise to ISIS.\n\nThe U.S. and Turkey, for example, have yet to agree on which enemy in Syria is a bigger threat - ISIS or the regime of Bashar al-Assad. In Iraq, Sunni Muslims have yet to join forces with Shiites in battling the militants, despite the formation of a more inclusive Iraqi government. The U.S. strategy depends on cooperation from local ground forces to beat back ISIS.\n\nMichael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution warns that airstrikes can only do so much, and ISIS will probably expand its control by a few percent. O'Hanlon suggests a limited presence of U.S. Special Forces and military spotters could be helpful.\n\nObama has been adamant that he will not order American ground forces into battle, but O'Hanlon argues that a limited presence of U.S. troops could be beneficial. Obama has promised that the U.S. is still in the early stages of what he promises will be a long-term campaign against ISIS.",
    " Title: Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's Influence Lingers Over Trump Administration Amid Ongoing Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe dismissal of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn from the White House 84 days ago continues to cast a long shadow over President Donald Trump's presidency. Since Flynn's highly publicized dismissal in February, the president has praised him as a \"wonderful man\" and tweeted in his defense hours before former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified that she warned the White House that Flynn had been \"compromised\" by the Russian government.\n\nThis continued loyalty from Trump has given Flynn a lingering influence over policy in the White House, where staffers initially hired by Flynn, including his deputy K.T. McFarland, remain on the National Security Council and in other positions. Senior administration officials, including chief strategist Steve Bannon, also remain loyal to Flynn and have worked to undermine his successor, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, according to several people familiar with the situation.\n\nFlynn, a three-star general who was dismissed from his post as Defense Intelligence Agency chief under President Barack Obama in 2014, backed Trump early, campaigned alongside him, and developed a close and trusted relationship with the candidate and his senior aides at a time when few serious Republicans would agree to advise him. \"Flynn was by far the most accomplished of all of them, and in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,\" said a former George W. Bush national security official.\n\nTrump's refusal to disavow Flynn has drawn the administration further into a controversy that began with allegations that Trump campaign aides had inappropriate contacts with Russian government officials. Those claims remain under investigation by congressional committees as well as the FBI.\n\nFlynn's failure to disclose his contacts with officials and payments received from Russian government-related entities has deepened the appearance of scandal around the administration. On Monday, NBC News reported that Flynn failed to disclose to the DIA when it renewed his security clearance last year that he received a check totaling nearly $34,000 from a Russian propaganda network.\n\nYates told lawmakers on Monday afternoon that she warned the Trump administration that Flynn was susceptible to blackmail, though she declined to say why. She echoed the concerns of Obama, who fired Flynn as head of the DIA in 2014 and warned Trump against hiring him when the two sat down after Trump's victory in November.\n\nThe relationship Flynn enjoyed with the president differs markedly from that of his successor, McMaster, who has clashed with the president repeatedly since joining the administration. Trump pushed back against McMaster's attempt to replace McFarland, who is set to become ambassador to Singapore. Last week, it was McFarland, not McMaster, who accompanied the president to a meeting with the Australian prime minister in New York, and Trump and McFarland kept reporters waiting on the tarmac for 40 minutes as they talked inside the plane at Andrews Air Force Base on Sunday night, after the president spent the weekend golfing at his club in New Jersey.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus earlier this month prevented McMaster from bringing on Brig. Gen. Ricky Waddell as his deputy, and though McFarland was supposed to depart for Singapore in mid-May, she has been telling associates in recent weeks that she's not leaving her NSC post anytime soon.\n\nMcMaster has worked to reshape the organization in the wake of Flynn's departure, removing Bannon from the NSC's Principals Committee and eliminating a handful of positions created by Flynn. Executive officer John Reed, a Flynn hire, was reassigned to the Coast Guard last week, and Adam Lovinger, a longtime national security official dispatched to the NSC from the Pentagon at Flynn's request, had his security clearance revoked by Secretary of Defense James Mattis' chief of staff, Kevin Sweeney.\n\nLovinger, according to internal communications reviewed by [source], had also clashed in recent months with his boss at the Pentagon over the types of issues the office focuses on, urging more attention be given to the threat of Iran and Islamic extremism\u2014two issues on which Flynn was outspoken and controversial both in his career at the Defense Intelligence Agency and on the campaign trail with Trump. In response to questions about Lovinger's status, the Pentagon declined to comment on a personnel issue.\n\nBut the president overrode McMaster's decision to reassign the NSC's senior director for intelligence, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, after Bannon and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has taken an increasingly prominent role in foreign affairs, made the case that he should remain in his post.\n\nA senior administration official rejected the notion that McMaster is working to rid the NSC of Flynn aides, pointing to over a dozen Flynn hires who McMaster has kept on board, including Matt Pottinger, the council's senior director for Asia, who received an award at an all-hands meeting last Thursday.",
    " Title: Reflections on the Life and Legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. 50 Years After His Assassination\n\nArticle:\n\nFifty years ago, on April 4, 1968, the world lost one of its most influential and courageous leaders, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. This article recounts a personal account of how Dr. King's life and work impacted a young, impoverished white boy, who, as an 8-year-old, first became aware of the civil rights leader through news reports.\n\nThe individual, who later worked in the White House for two presidents and in politics for over 20 years, recalls watching a news program featuring Dr. King, who had become the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize. The young boy was captivated by Dr. King's empathy, kindness, and the powerful message he delivered to tens of thousands of people.\n\nAs Dr. King's civil rights work began, the individual's parents, who were destructively dysfunctional alcoholics but also highly intelligent and educated, provided the young boy with magazines and newspapers featuring Dr. King. The first words of Dr. King that the boy read were his \"I Have a Dream\" speech.\n\nGrowing up in poverty and experiencing discrimination, the boy found solace and inspiration in Dr. King's fight against injustice. Dr. King's teachings about the inherent equality of all people, regardless of race, gender, faith, or sexual orientation, resonated deeply with the young boy.\n\nFifty years after Dr. King's assassination, the individual reflects on the continued relevance of Dr. King's wisdom, words, and compassion in today's divided and angry society. The individual believes that Dr. King's contributions to the nation and the world have been underestimated and that his stateliness and legacy are needed now more than ever.",
    " Title: Ethiopia Faces Worst Drought in Decades, Affecting Millions and Struggling to Secure Aid\n\nArticle:\n\nEthiopia, a Horn of Africa country, is currently experiencing its worst drought in decades, with millions of people lacking food and drinking water. The situation has been largely overlooked by a world preoccupied with other urgent global crises.\n\nGenet Tamisat, a 27-year-old mother of two, sits in the scorching sun cradling her 2-month-old baby, one of hundreds of mothers waiting for their children to be checked for malnutrition. \"I have nothing to eat at home. I can't even buy maize by myself,\" Tamisat said, also caring for a 4-year-old son. \"People can look at us and think we're OK, but we are in great danger. We have nothing.\"\n\nThe government and the United Nations are attempting to raise $1.4 billion to feed 10.2 million Ethiopians, but only half of the required funds have been secured so far. The ongoing conflicts in Syria and Yemen, as well as the migrant crisis, have dominated global headlines, diverting attention from Ethiopia's plight.\n\nChege Ngugi, national director of the charity ChildFund Ethiopia, expressed concern about the slow pace of fundraising. \"My priority is to support the efforts of the government of Ethiopia to save lives, but we're not reaching everybody,\" he said.\n\nA strong El Ni\u00f1o has disrupted two consecutive rainy seasons that typically nourish crops that feed 85% of the country. The drought has forced the government to seek additional food aid from the United States and other donors.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development has dispatched an emergency assistance team to Ethiopia, providing nearly $4 million in corn and wheat seeds for over 200,000 families. In the Oromia region, which includes central Ethiopia, the land is arid, with animal carcasses scattered across patches of dusty earth.\n\nHumanitarian needs in Ethiopia have tripled since the start of 2015, and malnutrition rates in the worst-affected areas have surpassed 20%, exceeding the World Health Organization's emergency threshold of 15%. This year, the food program will help over 2 million children, pregnant women, and breast-feeding mothers suffering from moderate acute malnutrition.\n\nThe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that almost 500,000 children need treatment for severe acute malnutrition. Eyoel Lemma, who works at ChildFund Ethiopia in Fentale, noted that providing supplementary food and malnutrition treatment to children under age 5 is challenging due to families migrating in search of water and pasture for their livestock and jobs.\n\nHaso Bultum, a 27-year-old mother, walked for hours in the sun across barren mountains to reach a rural health care facility in Fentale with her malnourished 9-month-old twins. \"It's very hard. I've had no sleep, because we're trying to find some food for our cattle,\" she said. \"To save ourselves, we're constantly moving.\"\n\nEthiopia has the fastest-growing economy in the world and has lifted millions of citizens out of poverty, but 80% of Ethiopians are still dependent on agriculture. Challiss McDonough, regional spokeswoman for the U.N.'s World Food Programme, warned that her organization could run out of food within two months if significant new funding is not received.\n\nSamuel Ferfu, manager of the Children's and Family Charitable Organization in Fentale, highlighted another major issue: the lack of access to water. Almost 6 million people need emergency water, according to UNICEF. \"There's no water at all\u2014the river is dry,\" he said. \"No water makes sanitation impossible, and as a result, the prevalence of disease will increase.\"\n\nFor the time being, Ethiopians are praying for rain, but flooding is a serious risk after a lengthy drought. \"Soon the rain will come, and people's worries will be flooding.

    " Title: Denver City Council Reverses Decision on Marijuana Smoking Ban on Private Property\n\nArticle:\n\nDenver officials have rescinded a controversial proposal that would have prohibited smoking marijuana on private property if it was in public view. The Denver City Council on Monday rejected an ordinance that would have restricted marijuana use on front porches, in front yards, or anywhere on private property in public view, according to The Denver Post.\n\nThe Denver City Council is expected to take its final vote next week on a revised measure that allows people to smoke marijuana on their properties or with permission from the property owner. Before the reversal, Councilwoman Jeanne Robb had introduced an amendment that would have prohibited marijuana consumption \"in any outdoor location on private residential property\" where it is \"clearly observable from a public street, highway or sidewalk.\"\n\nGoing into Monday's vote, at least six of the 13 city council members were leaning toward the rule, with Councilman Charlie Brown seen as a swing vote. However, the Council voted 7-6 Monday in favor of an amendment reversing Robb's language banning marijuana use on private property.\n\nColorado, along with Washington state, legalized the possession of up to one ounce of recreational marijuana for people 21 and older in 2012, despite it still being illegal under federal law. Advocates of a public ban, like Robb, believe seeing people smoke marijuana would send the wrong message to children and teens and that it would paint the city in a negative smoky haze.\n\nOpponents, like Mason Tvert, communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project, argue that the amendment strips away the rights voted by residents of Colorado to consume cannabis. \"Questions on where adults should use marijuana is a valid question,\" Tvert told FoxNews.com. \"There are likely proposals that may or may not make sense. The one in Denver does not.\"\n\nWhile it may be legal to consume alcohol on a porch or in the outdoor area of a bar, there are numerous laws across the country banning public drunkenness. And in most cities, it is illegal to carry an open container of alcohol outside your own property. Cigarette smokers, though, rarely encounter such regulations.\n\nDenver Police Chief Robert White has said if the front porch rule is voted in, it will be among the city's lowest priorities, and he doesn't expect many \u2013 if any \u2013 citations will ever be written.\n\nAs Colorado prepares for the start of legal pot sales on Jan. 1, Washington state is also gearing up for the start of marijuana sales by 2014. So far, there haven't been any local efforts to stop the production, sales, or use in that state, but many in the area are likely to study the lessons and tactics used in the Denver fight.\n\nOfficials in Chicago are also getting a jump-start on creating strict regulations about where pot can be grown and dispensed. The city's Department of Planning and Development has been working on legislation in anticipation of a state law taking effect that would make Illinois the 20th state in the country to allow medical marijuana use. The Chicago measure must still be voted on and approved by the Chicago City Council. If approved, it would allow 22 centers where cannabis can be grown in the city, with the same measure prohibiting them from opening within 2,500 feet of any school, day care center, or residential area.",
    " Title: Conservative Media Faces Calls for Improved Journalistic Integrity at CPAC\n\nArticle:\n\nThe conservative media is undergoing a period of introspection, with leading figures in the right-wing media sphere acknowledging a need for greater journalistic integrity. This issue has gained national attention following last year's election and the subsequent failed efforts to discredit figures such as Chuck Hagel, now President Obama's Secretary of Defense.\n\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), representatives from prominent conservative news outlets, including Fox News, Townhall, and The Daily Caller, will gather to discuss the future of conservative media. The panel, titled \"Survivor: Conservative Journalism,\" is a side event in the larger CPAC calendar, but it addresses one of the most pressing issues facing the Republican Party: the need for conservative media outlets to gain more recognition and credibility among mainstream media.\n\nKeith Urbahn, a former chief of staff to Donald Rumsfeld and one of Friday's panelists, stated, \"That the conservative movement now has its own media outlets is a terrific thing. But with that comes a basic responsibility to report facts and admit error\u2014something we slam the mainstream media for all the time. We don't always live up to those standards.\"\n\nIn late February, influential Red State blogger Erick Erickson argued that conservative journalists had \"forgotten the basics of reporting\" because they were \"trying so hard to highlight controversies, no matter how trivial.\" Similarly, The New Yorker editor Alex Koppelman argued that right-wing journalists would have to take the \"commitment to journalism more seriously\" if they wanted \"to be taken more seriously.\"\n\nThese columns were written after the conservative website Breitbart.com published articles alleging that Hagel had received funding from a group called \"Friends of Hamas.\" The group turned out to be non-existent\u2014a fact easily uncovered by a few minutes of basic reporting.\n\nErickson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that conservatives need to focus on building up \"good journalists committed to the basics.\" Katie Pavlich, the news editor of Townhall and one of Friday's panelists, likewise told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that \"moving forward, solid and documented investigative reporting will be key in gaining even more credibility throughout the industry.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Criticism of NFL and NBA Players Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump faced criticism from professional athletes over the weekend following his comments about NFL and NBA players during a campaign rally in Alabama on Friday night. Trump's remarks, which included calling for the firing of NFL players who kneel during the national anthem and withdrawing a White House invitation to NBA star Stephen Curry, sparked a series of responses from athletes on social media.\n\nAt the rally, Trump criticized NFL free agent Colin Kaepernick, saying that players who kneel during the national anthem should be fired and that fans should leave games. Several NFL players responded to Trump's comments on Twitter, while commissioner Roger Goodell issued a statement condemning Trump's \"divisive\" rhetoric.\n\n\"The NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country and our culture,\" Goodell said. \"There is no better example than the amazing response from our clubs and players to the terrible natural disasters we've experienced over the last month.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump stirred conflict early Saturday by announcing via Twitter that Curry was no longer welcome at the White House after the Golden State Warriors point guard said he did not want to pay the president a visit, a tradition for championship teams. NBA players, including LeBron James and Stephen Curry himself, clapped back at Trump, with James calling Trump a \"bum\" and saying that visiting the White House was an honor \"until you showed up.\"\n\nCurry had told reporters on Friday that he did not want to go to the White House, and said in June that he \"probably would not visit the White House due to Trump's stances on a variety of issues.\"\n\n\"By not going, hopefully it will inspire some change for what we tolerate in this country and what we stand for, what is accepted and what we turn a blind eye toward,\" he said. \"It's not just the act of not going. There are things you have to do on the back end to push that message into motion.\"\n\nA formal White House invitation has not been issued to the Warriors, however the NBA has been communicating with the White House about a visit, according to ESPN.\n\nTrump's feuding with the NFL and NBA athletes came as his party's latest efforts to make good on their promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare stumbled, with Sen. John McCain coming out against the plan on Friday. McCain's opposition potentially dooms the bill sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham, which GOP leaders had hoped to vote on in the coming week.\n\nTrump swiped at McCain several times during the rally in Alabama, where he was campaigning for Sen. Luther Strange ahead of the Senate GOP primary runoff on Tuesday. The president called McCain's opposition \"terrible,\" while vowing that Republicans would replace his predecessor's signature health-care law \"eventually.\"\n\nThe head of the NBA Players Association, Chris Paul, also slammed the president's remarks, questioning whether the president would call players \"a son of a b----\" to their face. With everything that's going on in our country, why are YOU focused on who's kneeling and visiting the White House? # StayInYoLane, Paul tweeted.\n\nThe controversy over Trump's comments about NFL and NBA players comes as the president faces growing criticism from both sides of the aisle over his handling of various issues, including his response to the recent natural disasters and his comments about Charlottesville.",
    " Title: U.S. Middle Class Struggles to Recover from Financial Crisis, Despite Resilient Consumer Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nThe economic impact of the 2008 financial crisis on American families has been further illuminated in a recent survey, with economist Jared Bernstein, an adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., stating that the details \"underscore how devastating this has been for the middle class.\" The survey reveals that while consumer spending has remained surprisingly resilient, families saved less and only slowly repaid debts.\n\nThe survey indicates a decline in the number of families saving anything over the previous year, with the share falling from 56.4 percent in 2007 to 52 percent in 2010. This suggests that a smaller group of families is saving more money, while a growing number manage to save nothing. Total savings have increased since 2007, but this increase is due to a smaller number of families saving more, not an overall increase in savings.\n\nThe survey also shows a shift in the reasons families save money. More families are saving as a precautionary measure, to ensure they have enough liquidity to meet short-term needs. Fewer families are saving for retirement, education, or for a down payment on a home.\n\nThe report also highlights the limited progress households have made in reducing debt. The share of households reporting any debt declined by 2.1 percentage points over the last three years, but 74.9 percent of households still owe something, and the median amount did not change.\n\nThe decline in reported incomes could have increased the weight of those debts, tying up a larger share of families' take-home pay. However, historically lower interest rates have helped to offset this effect. Families have also been able to reduce debt payments by refinancing into mortgages with longer terms and deferring repayment of student loans and other obligations.\n\nThe survey confirms that Americans are shifting the kinds of debts they carry. The share of families with credit card debt declined by 6.7 percentage points to 39.4 percent, and the median balance fell 16.1 percent to $2,600. Conversely, the share of families with education-related debt rose to 19.2 percent in 2010 from 15.2 percent in 2007. Education loans now make up a larger share of the average family's obligations than loans to buy automobiles for the first time in the history of the survey.\n\nThe cumulative statistics conceal large disparities in the impact of the crisis. Families with incomes in the middle 60 percent of the population lost a larger share of their wealth over the three-year period than the wealthiest and poorest families. The wealth of the middle class is mostly in housing, and the median amount of home equity dropped to $75,000 in 2010 from $110,000 in 2007. Housing prices have hardly budged since the crisis.\n\nThose middle-income families also lost a larger share of their income. The earnings of the median family in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution actually increased from 2007 to 2010, in part because of the expansion of government aid programs during the recession. Wealthier families, which derive more income from investments, were also cushioned against the recession.\n\nThe data does provide the latest indication that the recession reduced income inequality in the United States, at least temporarily. The average income of the wealthiest families fell much more sharply than the median, indicating that some at the very top of the ladder slipped down at least a few rungs.\n\nRanking American families by income, the top 10 percent of households still earned an average of $349,000 in 2010, with an average net worth of $2.9 million.",
    " Title: GOP Faces Tax Hike Reality as Obama Negotiations Progress\n\nArticle:\n\nWith three weeks remaining before the expiration of the Bush tax rates and potential spending cuts for the Pentagon and federal agencies totaling tens of billions of dollars, a reality for the Republican Party has emerged: Tax rates are increasing, and the primary question is by how much and for whom.\n\nDiscussions on Capitol Hill and K Street revolve around a slight increase in marginal tax rates, which would be coupled with raising the threshold for wealthy Americans facing tax increases from $250,000 to $500,000 or higher in annual income. However, any rate increase for Republicans, one that could garner support from rank-and-file lawmakers, would necessitate significant cuts to entitlement programs. As of yet, there is no evidence that President Barack Obama and the Democrats have agreed to specific entitlement cuts in closed-door negotiations, particularly those substantial enough to offset a rate change and an increase in the threshold for the wealthy.\n\n\"Both sides have to hold hands and jump on this one,\" said a top Senate aide.\n\nIf House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) fail to reach an agreement with Obama, the highest marginal tax rate will increase from 35 percent to 39.6 percent on January 1, the same as it was under former President Bill Clinton. Tax rates on estates will also surge, and nearly 30 million more Americans will be affected by the alternative minimum tax, initially designed to ensure wealthier individuals and families did not completely avoid federal taxes.\n\nThe proposed modest tax hikes in exchange for entitlement cuts have numerous issues, according to GOP Hill aides, who emphasized that this trade-off has not been formally presented yet.\n\nFirst, Democrats believe they are in a position of strength during these negotiations and are unlikely to relinquish concessions on entitlement programs without significant moves from Boehner.\n\n\"We are winning,\" said a top Hill Democratic staffer. \"We don't have to give up on anything yet.\"\n\nBoehner also faces pressure from his right and is concerned whether House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will support him. He has so far refused to agree to any increase in tax rates, even though many in his party are acknowledging such an outcome as unavoidable. The best Republicans can do, these lawmakers say, is limit the size of the increases while attempting to shift the political blame to the Democrats.\n\n\"The speaker is opposed to raising tax rates, because raising tax rates costs jobs,\" said Michael Steel, spokesman for Boehner.\n\nAny suggestion of Republicans backing a tax increase faces opposition in the Senate.\n\n\"That doesn't really help solve the problem,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), ranking member of the powerful Finance Committee. \"I'm against raising tax rates. We know that if we raise those tax rates and we don't have corresponding reductions in spending, we'll get the tax rates and no spending reductions. That's just a game that the Democrats play over and over and over, and the American people let them get away with it sometimes.\"",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Incorporate Obamacare Individual Mandate Repeal in Tax Cut Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans have revised their tax cut bill to include the repeal of the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This move, which was pushed by President Trump, is expected to generate over $300 billion in savings over the next decade that can be used for deeper tax cuts for average Americans.\n\nThe Senate's top leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have expressed optimism about the move, stating that it will provide more tax relief to individuals. However, Democrats have criticized the move, with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer stating that it will raise premiums for middle-class Americans and potentially leave 13 million people without health care coverage.\n\nThe tax cut bill, as revised, amounts to a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years, with about 60% going to businesses and the rest to individual taxpayers. The plan slashes the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% and lowers the top individual rate from 39.6% to 38.5%, while adjusting other individual tax brackets so they kick in at higher income thresholds.\n\nThe revised plan also includes a doubling of the child tax credit from the current $1,000 to $2,000, and some other tweaks to individual tax rates. The plan also makes changes so more \"pass-through\" companies that file their taxes as individuals can claim a new 17.4% deduction, designed to give a boost to small businesses.\n\nThe plan eliminates a number of deductions, such as the one for state and local taxes paid, and uses the savings to pay for lowering the rates. With the plan bumping up against the $1.5 trillion cap set in the 2018 budget for tax cuts, lawmakers were left searching for new ways to free up money to do more for the middle class.\n\nThe individual mandate plan, which the Congressional Budget Office said would save the government over $300 billion over the next 10 years, was seen by some Republicans as a natural solution to their failure this year to repeal Obamacare in its entirety.\n\nThe House tax bill that advanced out of the Ways and Means Committee last week did not include a repeal of the mandate, though some Republicans have expressed a desire to include it in the discussion as leaders prepare for a floor vote in the House this week. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan stated that the House is pushing the bill \"as we have it,\" though he described things as a work in progress. The House plan also lowers the corporate tax rate to 20% immediately, while the Senate version delays it for one year. The House also includes a full repeal of the estate tax on inheritances, while the Senate doubles the exemption rate but leaves the tax in place.",
    " Title: Clinton's Testimony on Benghazi Attack: A Look into the Democratic Mindset\n\nArticle:\n\nLast week, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared before two congressional panels to discuss the events that transpired at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012. During the hearing, Clinton was questioned about the administration's initial response to the attack, which was characterized as a spontaneous protest sparked by an offensive YouTube video.\n\nOn that fateful day, the consulate was overrun by heavily armed terrorists, who killed the U.S. ambassador and set the building on fire. Following the attack, dozens of Americans fled to a more heavily fortified annex nearby, but U.S. forces did not intervene during the next 10 hours, resulting in the deaths of three more individuals, including two Navy SEALs.\n\nFor weeks, the White House and top administration officials maintained that the assault was a spontaneous response to a video posted on YouTube that Muslims found offensive. However, during a Senate hearing, Clinton was asked why the administration had provided faulty information for such a prolonged period. In response, Clinton became visibly upset and stated, \"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided to go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?\"\n\nThe hearing was intended to be a fact-finding mission, with lawmakers seeking to understand what went wrong and, if possible, the cause of the deadly blunder. They also aimed to hear from Clinton about the administration's initial assertion that a video caused an impromptu protest that led to the death of the U.S. ambassador.\n\nDuring the hearing, Clinton made it clear that she did not feel accountable to elected lawmakers or the American people. \"What difference does it make?\" she exclaimed. Clinton's response was met with criticism, as many felt that the hearing was intended to determine why the administration had initially attributed the attack to a video-sparked protest.\n\nIn the days preceding the hearing, senators had made it clear that they planned to ask about the administration's initial response to the attack. Clinton, however, maintained that it was less important to understand the motivations of the attackers than to find and bring them to justice.\n\nThe hearing served as a glimpse into the Democratic mindset, with some viewing Clinton's response as a reflection of the party's tendency to prioritize their goals above all else, even if it means bending or outright lying about the truth. This approach has been a hallmark of the Clinton family's political career, with past instances of alleged dishonesty, such as Bill Clinton's affair with a White House intern and Hillary Clinton's cattle futures contracts, being downplayed or dismissed.\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race approaches, some political analysts see Clinton's response to the Benghazi hearing as a potential indicator of the type of candidate she may be in the future. Critics argue that her unwillingness to answer questions and her dismissive attitude towards lawmakers' inquiries could set a dangerous precedent for a potential Clinton presidency.",

The cause of death was complications from a fall at his home on May 10, according to the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nAiles, a confidant of presidents and an acknowledged master of communications, resigned from Fox in July amid charges of sexual harassment. His widow, Elizabeth Ailes, confirmed the news in a statement.\n\n\"I am profoundly sad and heartbroken to report that my husband, Roger Ailes, passed away this morning,\" the statement read. \"Roger was a loving husband to me, to his son Zachary, and a loyal friend to many. He was also a patriot, profoundly grateful to live in a country that gave him so much opportunity to work hard, to rise\u2014and to give back.\"\n\nRupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox and Fox News Channel, said he was saddened by the development.\n\n\"Everybody at Fox is shocked and grieved by the death of Roger Ailes,\" Murdoch said. \"A brilliant broadcaster, Roger played a huge role in shaping America's media over the last 30 years. He will be remembered by the many people on both sides of the camera he discovered, nurtured, and promoted.\"\n\nSean Hannity, a Fox News host, tweeted tributes to his onetime boss in a series of messages.\n\n\"Today, America lost one of its great patriotic warriors,\" Hannity tweeted. \"He has dramatically and forever changed the political and the media landscape, single-handedly for the better.\"\n\nAiles was born in Warren, Ohio, and attended Ohio University in Athens, where he majored in radio and television. After graduating in 1962, he launched his career in black and white-era television by working for then-local personality Mike Douglas. When the show was syndicated a few years later, Ailes' star rose with it.\n\nIt was during a 1967 taping of \"The Mike Douglas Show\" that Ailes met future president Richard Nixon, who later tapped him to serve as his executive producer for television. That experience began a decades-long dual track in which Ailes cast long shadows over both television and politics, culminating in his founding of Fox News.\n\nIn 1984, Ailes worked on President Reagan's re-election campaign. Four years later, he was a key player in the successful presidential campaign of George H.W. Bush, helping to plot effective messaging and television advertising strategies. He later helped build CNBC before Murdoch chose him to launch Fox News.\n\nAs recently as last fall's election, and after his career at Fox had ended, Ailes reportedly advised President Trump in preparation for debates.

    " Title: State Department Releases Previously Undisclosed Emails from Hillary Clinton's Tenure as Secretary of State\n\nArticle:\n\nThe State Department has released 44 previously undisclosed email exchanges from Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. These emails were not included in the 30,000 private messages Clinton handed over to the government last year. The emails show Clinton interacting with lobbyists, political and Clinton Foundation donors, and business interests during her time as Secretary of State.\n\nThe conservative legal group Judicial Watch obtained the emails as part of its lawsuit against the State Department. The emails cover Clinton's first three months as Secretary of State in early 2009, a period for which Clinton did not turn over any emails to the State Department last year. The government found the newly disclosed messages during a search of agency computer files from longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin.\n\nOne instance shows Clinton exchanging messages with a senior Morgan Stanley investment executive whom she met with later that year at her office in Washington. These emails were among 246 pages of Abedin messages turned over to Judicial Watch.\n\nClinton campaign officials did not immediately answer questions about the issue.\n\nThe emails are separate from a larger batch of several thousand work-related emails that FBI officials recovered from Clinton's private server. Clinton's legal team turned over more than 30,000 emails from her server to the State Department last March but only after deleting another 30,000 messages that Clinton's team deemed private and personal. The FBI plans to turn over the reconstructed Clinton emails to the State Department for public release.\n\nThe new Clinton emails include a February 2009 message to her from Stephen Roach, then-chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, saying he planned to testify to Congress that week and was \"happy to help in any way I can.\" Roach later met with Clinton over the summer for 30 minutes, according to Clinton calendars obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nIn another email, Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, informed her that National Security Agency and State Department officials discussed an attempt to develop a modified Blackberry for Clinton that might be used when she worked in a restricted State Department office that did not allow private phones. Clinton called the development \"good news,\" but she continued using a private Blackberry tied to her private server.",

According to a report by Motherboard, a security firm, SecureWorks, investigating the hackings, found that Podesta had fallen prey to a phishing attack set up by a Russian hacking ring known as Fancy Bear.\n\nThe group reportedly sent several members of Hillary Clinton's inner-circle emails in March with a custom Bitly link leading to a fake Gmail login page. Podesta had clicked on the link and entered his password, thus giving the hackers unfettered access to his account.\n\nFancy Bear, also known as APT28 and Sofacy, was also allegedly behind a similar attack on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) last summer. Thomas Rid, a professor at King's College, wrote in Esquire that the group made its \"gravest mistake\" by forgetting to set the Bitly links to private, allowing investigators to see whom else the group had targeted.\n\nThe Russian government is believed to be sponsoring the attacks and disseminating the information to Clinton's foes, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. A Clinton spokesman stated, \"There is no longer any doubt that Putin is trying to help Donald Trump by weaponizing WikiLeaks.\"\n\nThe threat of Russian espionage has become one of the key issues in the 2016 election, not just because it reveals critical weaknesses in America's cyber-security, but also because it highlights how Russia has sought to tilt the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. John Podesta, for one, is not making matters easier. It is hoped that the next time the 67-year-old former chief of staff to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama receives an email with a funny-looking link, he thinks twice before clicking.",
    " Title: Governors Divided on Trump's Plan for Reopening Economies Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the death toll from COVID-19 continues to rise, governors across the United States are grappling with the challenge of reopening their economies while ensuring the safety of their citizens. On Thursday, the White House released a three-phase plan outlining guidelines for when states might reopen. During a call with governors, President Trump suggested states should begin easing restrictions after a 14-day decline in new COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe response to the plan varied by party. Democratic governors generally expressed concern that it was too early to provide a timeline for reopening and called for more testing support from the federal government. Republican governors, while urging caution, were more optimistic about the possibility of a swift return to normalcy.\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, stated, \"We appreciate their suggestions, and we will evaluate them thoroughly, but the plain overriding fact is we cannot put the cart before the horse.\" She emphasized that the Centers for Disease Control, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and public health experts across the country have not yet deemed it safe to reopen, and doing so prematurely would endanger many more people and potentially lead to increased transmission of the virus.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, expressed the need for federal help in fully reopening the state's economy. He accused President Trump of \"passing the buck without passing the bucks.\" In response, Trump tweeted, \"Governor Cuomo should spend more time 'doing' and less time 'complaining.'\"\n\nWashington state recently extended its stay-at-home order to early May. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee told NPR's All Things Considered that two conditions would need to be met before the state could reopen its economy: a significant reduction in infections and a comprehensive and robust testing and contact-tracing system. Inslee stated that the contact tracing system is dependent on widespread testing, which does not currently exist in the United States.\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, told NPR's Morning Edition that the federal guidelines resemble the plan the state adopted the day before. Polis expressed a desire for a national testing strategy, stating, \"Most other countries are doing it nationally.\" He added, \"I wish that we had more help from the federal government.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper said he appreciated the White House's guidance but noted the need for more federal assistance with testing and personal protective equipment. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown echoed other Democratic governors' calls for more federal aid.\n\nIn contrast to Democrats, the response from Republican governors was more enthusiastic. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee stated, \"I think the president and his team are headed in a very good direction.\" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said her takeaway from the call with Trump was that the federal government is a partner. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts and Idaho Gov. Brad Little also expressed support for the president's guidelines.\n\nOn Friday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced a series of executive orders that would start to reopen shuttered businesses, making Texas the first state to lay out a defined rollback of COVID-19 restrictions. Retail outlets in the state will be able to open on April 24, as long as they can deliver items to customers' cars or homes to minimize contact. Texas will also loosen restrictions on surgeries, permitting procedures that would not deplete the hospital capacity or the personal protective equipment needed to cope with COVID-19.",

In a series of tweets, the president claimed the \"Mainstream Media\" has \"gone bonkers\" and accused the media of pushing \"Radical Left Democrat views.\"\n\n\"They have gone bonkers, and no longer care what is right or wrong,\" Trump tweeted. \"This large scale false reporting is sick!\" He added, \"Fake News Equals the Enemy of the People!\"\n\nFor the second consecutive day, Trump pushed back on a Washington Post story recounting the fallout of his incendiary tweets targeting Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.). He went on to decry \"fake news\" as \"the Enemy of the People.\"\n\nTrump took issue with a line of The Washington Post piece that said advisers wrote out talking points and handed the president \"reams of opposition research on the four Congresswomen.\" However, a photo taken by a Post photographer last week showed Trump at a White House event with sheets of paper containing bullet points of information about Omar and the other representatives.\n\nThe president followed up his criticism of the Post story with broader condemnation of the press, accusing it of pushing \"Radical Left Democrat views.\" Trump frequently describes coverage he deems unfavorable as \"fake news,\" and has regularly labeled certain media outlets the \"enemy of the people\" despite warnings from press advocates about the danger of the term.\n\nTrump has been preoccupied for days with the media coverage of his attacks on the four congresswomen, which began with tweets eight days ago saying the lawmakers should \"go back\" to their countries despite all four being U.S. citizens. Only Omar, who came to the U.S. as a Somali refugee, was born outside the U.S. Trump has escalated his attacks in the days since, claiming repeatedly that the lawmakers hate the country and defending supporters who chanted \"send her back\" about Omar as \"incredible patriots.\"",
    " Title: Giuliani Clarifies: No Pardons for Russia Investigation Targets During Ongoing Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump's lead attorney, Rudy Giuliani, clarified on Sunday that the president will not issue pardons to targets in the ongoing investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election during the inquiry.\n\n\"The president is not going to issue a pardon in this investigation,\" Giuliani said. \"I want that to come out loud and clear.\"\n\nHowever, Giuliani, in an appearance on CNN's State of the Union, left open the possibility that the president could take action when the Russia inquiry is concluded if he determines that people had been \"treated unfairly.\"\n\n\"You are not going to get a pardon just because you are involved in this investigation,\" the outspoken former New York mayor said, before quickly adding that those targets \"certainly won't be excluded.\"\n\nGiuliani raised the prospect of pardons late last week, after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was jailed for violating terms of his bail in Washington. Manafort is awaiting a September trial on money laundering and fraud charges. He also faces a July trial in Alexandria, Va., where he is charged with bank and tax fraud.\n\nA federal judge revoked Manafort's $10 million bond on Friday after he was charged with obstruction for allegedly tampering with witnesses in the pending criminal cases against him.\n\nManafort is one of 20 people known to be charged in the yearlong Russia investigation. Five people, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates, have pleaded guilty.\n\n\"When the whole thing is over, things might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons,\" Giuliani told the New York Daily News. \"You put a guy in jail if he\u2019s trying to kill witnesses, not just talking to witnesses.\"\n\nGiuliani also renewed his attacks on the legitimacy of the Russia investigation headed by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. Citing findings in last week's Justice Department inspector general's report related to the conduct of two senior FBI agents, the former mayor called for a review of the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nThe inspector general, during an 18-month review of the handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, unearthed text messages exchanged by the agents in which they disparaged Trump. Both of the agents held top positions in both the FBI's Clinton and Trump investigations.\n\nIn one of the messages, FBI counter-intelligence official Peter Strzok suggested that he might take action to \"stop\" Trump's candidacy.\n\n\"We want the Mueller probe to be investigated,\" Giuliani said Sunday.\n\nLater Sunday, Giuliani said on CBS' Face the Nation that he would continue to push for such an internal review as a condition in the ongoing negotiations with Mueller who is seeking an interview with Trump in the Russia inquiry.\n\nAs part of that investigation, Mueller's team is reviewing whether Trump sought to obstruct the probe when he fired FBI Director James Comey last year.\n\n\"We are in rather sensitive negotiations,\" Giuliani said, adding that it was important to first learn whether Strzok had \"infected\" the Russia investigation before he was removed last year.\n\n\"I don't want to do it,\" Giuliani said, referring to a Mueller interview with Trump. \"The president wants to do it.\"\n\nThe former mayor said a decision on a possible interview would likely be made by July 4.",
    " Title: Democrats Raise Record Funds in Third Quarter, Outpace Republicans in Congressional Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final stretch of the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats have raised substantial funds, with 60 of their candidates raising over $1 million in the last three months, a significant increase from the $1 million that was once the standard for congressional candidates during the administration of President George W. Bush. This surge in fundraising has erased the Republicans' typical fundraising edge, as Democrats capitalize on an energized base of small donors.\n\nIn Fresno, California, prosecutor Andrew Janz, a Democrat, raised an impressive $4.1 million in the third quarter. He is challenging eight-term Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee and a staunch ally of President Trump. Janz's donor base is widespread, with support coming from various parts of the country and state.\n\nSimilarly impressive fundraising numbers have been announced by other Democratic challengers. Sharice Davids, in an eastern Kansas district, raised $2.7 million. Amy McGrath, in central Kentucky, raised $3.65 million. Elissa Slotkin, in southern Michigan, raised $2.6 million.\n\nCompiled spending numbers offer some good news and some bad news for the Republicans. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC aligned with House Republicans, has spent $90 million on the general-election campaign, compared to $51 million by its Democratic rival, the House Majority PAC. However, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has outspent the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) $64 million to $47 million. Furthermore, Democratic House candidates, fueled by small-donor contributions, have outspent Republican candidates $109 million to $60 million.\n\nFormer DCCC chair Steve Israel stated, \"The Republican super PACs may not be able to just write a single check to buy a single race because of the massive grassroots fundraising energy behind Democrats this year.\"\n\nWhile fundraising success does not guarantee Democrats an easy path to victory, most of them are challenging incumbents, who have previously won on the same terrain. Andrew Janz's opponent, Devin Nunes, was reelected two years ago with a 35-point margin, and a recent poll showed Nunes leading Janz by 8 points.\n\nJanz initially focused on building a robust fundraising operation because, as he stated, \"we knew that the national party and the DCCC were not going to be supporting us.\"\n\nAs the election approaches, both parties are starting the process of reallocating super PAC and party funds from candidates who have failed to gain momentum. For some House Republicans, the race may be virtually over, with Reps. Rod Blum of Iowa, Mike Coffman of Colorado, and Mike Bishop of Michigan among those who have lost support as the NRCC and CLF cancel ad buys and shift dollars to other contests with better prospects.\n\nTom Davis, a former Republican congressman who worked two election cycles as chairman of the NRCC, suggested the script for the NRCC chair as he delivers bad news to a colleague in the House Republican Conference: \"We thought we'd be able to do a million dollars in TV, but now we have to put that somewhere else because frankly, you're just not performing, and we can't afford to waste it to make you feel good.\"",
    " Title: Fox News: Ailes' Departure and Shine's Promotion Raise Questions About Culture Change\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the departure of former Fox News co-founder Roger Ailes, the network has undergone significant changes, with some employees interpreting the events as a shift in the company's culture, while others view it as an attempt to move past the sexual harassment allegations that led to Ailes' exit.\n\nAiles, who was known for his close associate Bill Shine, was succeeded by interim CEO Rupert Murdoch after his departure. In a move that seemed counter-intuitive to some, the Murdochs, who are the sons of Rupert Murdoch and are still commonly referred to as \"the Boys,\" promoted Shine and Fox Television Stations executive Jack Abernethy to co-presidents of Fox News. The company also retained Dianne Brandi, the general counsel, and Suzanne Scott, executive vice president of programming and development.\n\nThese moves have raised questions about the extent of the culture change at Fox News. Some within the network view the swift removal of Ailes as a concession to the Murdoch sons, particularly James Murdoch, who reportedly was not a fan of Ailes' role in promoting Donald Trump and was troubled by the aging demographics of Fox News' audience.\n\nAccording to three people briefed on the matter, the company provided Paul, Weiss lawyers with a list of women to speak to during their internal investigation. The promotion of Shine, who was reportedly implicated in the allegations made by former Fox booker Laurie Luhn, has been a subject of debate, with some questioning whether the Murdochs vetted him thoroughly before making the appointment.\n\nAs the internal investigation continues, it remains to be seen how these changes will impact the future of Fox News and the extent to which the network will undergo a cultural transformation.",
    " Title: White Nationalists Rally at University of Virginia, Clash with Counter-Protesters\n\nArticle:\n\nHundreds of white nationalists gathered at the University of Virginia on Friday, protesting against plans to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The group, which chanted \"White lives matter\" and \"You will not replace us,\" marched through the Charlottesville university, leading to clashes with counter-protesters.\n\nThe event, organized by Jason Kessler, who has previously accused the town of \"anti-white hatred,\" was described by Kessler as an \"incredible moment for white people who've had it up to here and are not going to take it anymore.\"\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post reported that the crowd also chanted \"Jew will not replace us\" during the event. Demonstrators held lit torches, some of which were seen as a reference to the Ku Klux Klan, and chanted \"Blood and soil\" and \"One people, one nation, end immigration.\"\n\nA smaller group of counter-protesters had gathered, surrounding the university's statue of Thomas Jefferson, holding a banner that read \"VA Students Act Against White Supremacy.\" The marchers and counter-protesters clashed violently, with one counter-protester reportedly spraying pepper spray at the marchers.\n\nThe rally was met with criticism from many local residents and politicians. Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer called the march \"a cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance.\" He wrote on Facebook, \"Everyone has a right under the First Amendment to express their opinion peaceably, so here's mine: not only as the Mayor of Charlottesville, but as a UVA faculty member and alumnus, I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus.\"\n\nCharlottesville is considered a liberal college town, with 86% of the county voting for Hillary Clinton in last year's presidential elections. However, the town has become a focal point for white nationalists after the city council voted to remove a statue of General Lee.\n\nSome observers also argue that President Donald Trump's election to the White House re-energized the far right across the US. Last month, Ku Klux Klan supporters staged a march in Virginia but were outnumbered by counter-protesters.",
    " Title: Trump to Call for International Pressure on North Korea, Criticize Iran and Venezuela at UN General Assembly\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump is set to address the United Nations General Assembly later today, his first speech to the world body. The address will take place at 10:30 New York time (14:30 GMT). According to White House officials, Trump will refer to Islamist militants as \"losers\" and criticize Iran and Venezuela in his speech.\n\nTrump has previously hinted at the possibility of the U.S. cutting its UN funding. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has stated that if the U.S. withdraws from international affairs, the void left will be filled by others.\n\nIn his speech, Trump is expected to call on UN member states to act against North Korea's \"destabilizing, hostile, and dangerous behavior.\" North Korea stated on Monday that more sanctions and pressure would only make it accelerate its nuclear program. The country has conducted repeated missile tests this year and its sixth nuclear test earlier this month.\n\nTrump will also express concern about Iran in his speech. Last week, he stated that Iran had \"violated the spirit\" of a 2015 deal aimed at stopping it from developing a nuclear weapon. The U.S. president has been a frequent critic of the agreement.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated last week in London that Iran was not contributing positively to regional security \"through their actions to prop up the Assad regime [in Syria],\" by engaging in \"malicious activities in the region,\" and by \"aggressively developing ballistic missiles.\"\n\nA White House official briefing reporters on Trump's speech stated that Iran and North Korea presented a \"shared menace\" to the world. The official was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying, \"Nations can not be bystanders to history and if we do not confront the threats now, they will only gather force and become more formidable.\"\n\nTrump was at the UN on Monday and held meetings with some world leaders, in addition to attending a special meeting on UN reform. He told the leaders of some Latin American countries that the situation in Venezuela was \"totally unacceptable,\" calling it a socialist dictatorship. He stated that the U.S. was \"prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Frustration with Sessions Continues Amidst Ongoing Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nPress Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated on Tuesday that President Trump's frustration with Attorney General Jeff Sessions is not abating, following a series of critical tweets from the president regarding Sessions' handling of the Russia meddling investigation and perceived lack of action on Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes.\n\nSanders, in an interview with \"Fox & Friends,\" neither confirmed nor denied reports that Trump has discussed the possibility of firing Sessions. She did not rule out the possibility, stating that any such decision would be the president's to make. Sanders also addressed rumors about former federal prosecutor and ex-New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani being considered for the job, stating that Giuliani is someone Trump \"respects,\" but that Sessions is currently the attorney general.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump tweeted a series of messages criticizing Sessions for the absence of an investigation into Clinton's connections to Ukraine and his alleged stance on other Clinton controversies. Trump's tweets read, \"Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign \u2013 'quietly working to boost Clinton.' So where is the investigation A.G.?\" and \"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!\"\n\nSessions has been under fire since last week, when Trump leveled harsh criticisms in a New York Times interview, calling Sessions' recusal \"very unfair to the president\" and adding that he never would have appointed him attorney general had he known he would do so. Sessions, however, has stated that he intends to stay in his post.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, citing three people who have recently spoken to the president, Trump continues to express anger over Sessions' decision to recuse himself from all matters related to the Russia investigation and has discussed the possibility of firing him. Those who have spoken with the president cautioned that a change may not be imminent or happen at all.\n\nIf Trump were to fire Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would be elevated to the top post on an acting basis. This would leave the president with another attorney general of whom he has been sharply critical in both public and private for his handling of the Russia probe, according to four White House and outside advisers who, like others interviewed, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nThe president's tweet about Sessions comes less than a week after Trump, in a New York Times interview, said that Sessions should never have taken the job as attorney general if he was going to recuse himself. Sessions made that decision after it was revealed that he had met with a top Russian diplomat last year.\n\nTrump and Sessions' conversations in recent weeks have been infrequent. Sessions had recently asked senior White House staff how he might patch up relations with the president, but that effort did not go anywhere, according to a person briefed on the conversations.\n\nNewt Gingrich, a frequent Trump adviser, stated that the president, with his criticisms of Sessions, was simply venting and being \"honest about his feelings.\" However, he added that the president's comments would have repercussions when it comes to staff morale. \"Anybody who is good at team building would suggest to the president that attacking members of your team rattles the whole team,\" Gingrich said.\n\nSessions and Trump used to be close, sharing both a friendship and an ideology. Sessions risked his reputation when he became the first U.S. senator to endorse the celebrity businessman and his early backing gave Trump legitimacy, especially among the hard-line anti-immigration forces that bolstered his candidacy. Several of Sessions' top aides now serve in top administration posts, including Stephen Miller, the architect of several of Trump's signature proposals, including the travel ban and tough immigration policy.\n\nAfter Trump's public rebuke last week, Sessions seemed determined to keep doing the job he said \"goes beyond anything that I would have ever imagined for myself.\" \"I'm totally confident that we can continue to run this office in an effective way,\" Sessions said last week.",
    " Title: Federal Agents Deployed to Chicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot Rejects Trump's Plan, Cites Safety Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and raised safety concerns, President Donald Trump has threatened to send federal agents to Chicago to quell protests and address violent crime. This decision has been met with opposition from local politicians, including Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who has rejected the idea of deploying federal agents to the city.\n\nAccording to reports by the Associated Press, Trump's threats come after Chicago recorded a weekend with a dozen fatalities and 63 people wounded by gunfire. In response, Lightfoot sent a letter to the White House, rejecting the deployment of federal agents who \"arrest, and detain residents without any cause.\"\n\nLightfoot suggested alternative measures such as universal background checks, federal enforcement of existing laws, and help from the federal government on illegal gun sales. In her letter, the mayor expressed that bringing in federal agents to Chicago would be dangerous and make communities there unsafe.\n\nDuring a White House press conference on Monday, Trump targeted Chicago, questioning if the city needed help after the weekend's violence. In response, Lightfoot requested more aid for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives officials and federal prosecutors. Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor herself, also stated, \"We don't need federal agents without any insignia taking people off the streets and holding them, I think, unlawfully.\"\n\nIn an interview with Joy Reid on MSNBC Monday night, Lightfoot expressed her intention to defend Chicago against Trump's plans, stating, \"If they try it, I'm going to use every tool at my disposal to stop them. We still have a constitution, we still have laws on the books, and I'm going to use those to deploy against them. We're not going to have tyranny in the city of Chicago. It's just not going to happen.\"\n\nThis development comes after federal agents were sent to Portland, Oregon, beginning July 14, where they were seen arresting and detaining peaceful demonstrators, according to The Oregonian. The Trump administration has come under fire for this action, with local politicians and demonstrators expressing anger. The president has also threatened to send federal officers to other cities, including New York and Philadelphia, to address unrest and violence.",
    " Title: Google's Top News Sources Skewed Toward Left-Leaning Outlets, Study Finds\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study from the Computational Journalism Lab at Northwestern University has found that Google's top news sources for search results are predominantly from left-leaning outlets. The study, conducted by researchers Daniel Trielli and Nicholas Diakopoulos, analyzed the results of more than 200 news-related questions every day in November 2017.\n\nThe researchers found that 86% of Google's Top Stories came from only 20 news sources, with three sources dominating the coverage, accounting for 23% of all impressions. CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post accounted for 10.9%, 6.5%, and 5.6% of the impressions, respectively.\n\nThe study's methodology involved counting an \"article impression each time one of those links appears\" in Google's Top Stories Box. However, the study's methodology drew some concerns about potential duplication of certain links skewing the impression count and the fact that the study considered results from 2017, a time when Google makes thousands of changes to its search engine each year.\n\nGoogle, through its spokesperson, argued that its algorithms cannot detect political affiliations or sentiments when collecting content, but rather measure a variety of factors, including relevance, timing, and authoritativeness of a source. The company stated that its algorithms are designed to elevate news from authoritative sources and require publishers to be transparent and accountable to be represented in news results.\n\nThe study also compared the list of sources to another study that measured the ideological affiliation of a news outlet by analyzing the political stances of those sharing content on Facebook. From that, they found that 62% of the impressions were from sources considered left-leaning, and only 11% from right-leaning outlets.\n\nGoogle confirmed the research duo's theory, noting that bigger outlets have more manpower to produce more articles, and their engine essentially crowdsources based on available content. In light of the growing scrutiny on how Google might be able to influence the news cycle, the company launched its own \"How News Works\" page, stating that it does not have an editorial point of view and is committed to fostering a healthy and diverse news ecosystem. The website states, \"We don't have an editorial point of view. Instead, Google products are designed to connect you with a broad array of information and perspectives to help you develop your own point of view and make informed decisions.\"",

Carville argued that the benefits of the Clinton Foundation, which raises funds for various charitable causes, outweighed any potential drawbacks.\n\n\"The good would be that we wouldn't be gabbing about it here,\" Carville said. \"The bad would be that we would be out hundreds of millions of dollars that are doing good.\" He further stated that the Clinton Foundation takes money from wealthy donors and distributes it to those in need, a practice he described as \"a pretty good idea.\"\n\nCarville acknowledged that, given the political climate surrounding Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, it may not have been politically palatable for the Clinton Foundation to operate as it had. However, he maintained that the foundation was doing a lot of good.\n\nWhen asked about the political advisability of the Clinton Foundation's operations, Carville replied, \"As a political adviser, of course.\" However, as a human being, he expressed doubt, stating, \"As a human being I think [the foundation] does an enormous amount of good.\"\n\nCo-host Joe Scarborough countered Carville's claims, stating that the charity could have operated effectively without Bill Clinton leading fundraising efforts. Scarborough argued that if the charity was a strong one, it could stand on its own and other people could raise funds for it. He also disputed Carville's assertion that the Clinton Foundation's operations were a zero-sum game, stating that it was not a matter of Bill Clinton raising funds while his wife was running for president, leading to dire consequences.",

Cohen made these statements during an off-camera interview with ABC News correspondent George Stephanopoulos on Sunday night.\n\nStephanopoulos, who posted a summary of the conversation, reported that Cohen indicated a readiness to cooperate not only with Mueller but also with federal prosecutors in New York who are investigating Cohen for potential election law and financial crimes. Cohen's lawyer, Guy Petrillo, will reportedly provide guidance on these decisions.\n\nCohen stated, \"My wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will.\" He continued, \"I put family and country first.\"\n\nIn April, Trump tweeted that Cohen was a businessman \"who I have always liked & respected.\" Trump's tweet went on to suggest that Cohen might cooperate with investigators if given the opportunity, stating, \"Most people will flip if the government lets them out of trouble, even if it means lying or making up stories.\"\n\nWhen asked by Stephanopoulos how he might respond if the president or his legal team attempted to discredit him and his work for Trump, Cohen replied, \"I will not be a punching bag as part of anyone's defense strategy. I am not a villain of this story, and I will not allow others to try to depict me that way.\"\n\nMueller's investigation into Russian ties to the 2016 Trump campaign has resulted in charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn and ex-campaign officials Paul Manafort and George Papadopoulos. The departures of other campaign aides have also been linked to the probe.\n\nFederal investigators have been examining Cohen's business dealings, including payments to adult-film star Stormy Daniels and other women who claimed they had affairs with Trump. In April, investigators raided Cohen's home and office.\n\nSince then, Trump's personal lawyers, Cohen's attorneys, and federal officials have been embroiled in a legal battle over access to millions of documents.\n\nCohen told Stephanopoulos, \"I respect the prosecutors.

    " Title: White House Selects Trump's Miami Resort for G7 Summit, Sparking Ethics Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House announced on Thursday that President Donald Trump's golf resort in Miami, Trump National Doral, will host next year's Group of Seven summit. The decision has sparked criticism from those who view it as the most overt example yet of the President using his office to boost his business empire.\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, in announcing Trump National Doral as host, stated, \"It's not the only place. It's the best place.\" Mulvaney cited the resort's location and amenities as reasons for the selection. He also asserted that the President will not profit because the resort will be booked \"at cost.\"\n\nHowever, the decision raises concerns about Trump's apparent conflicts of interest, as foreign dignitaries will have no choice but to spend money at his resort during the June 10-12 summit. Ethics lawyer Kathleen Clark of Washington University School of Law commented, \"He is daring anyone to prevent him from further enriching himself from the presidency.\"\n\nThe decision comes amid several lawsuits accusing Trump of violating the Constitution's emoluments clause, which bans the President from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments. The decision also follows Trump's repeated accusations against Joe Biden's family for profiting from public office due to Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine during his father's vice presidency.\n\nMulvaney dismissed such concerns, as well as the idea that the summit at Trump's Doral course would serve as a massive promotion for his brand. He stated, \"Donald Trump's brand is strong as it is. It's the most recognized name in the English language.\"\n\nTrump himself suggested the idea during a brainstorming session on possible sites, stating, \"What about Doral?\" Mulvaney noted that Trump National Doral was \"far and away the best physical facility\" among a dozen potential sites that were considered. He added that holding the event at Doral would be dramatically cheaper and promised to provide financial figures after the event to support this claim.\n\nCritics noted that Trump National Doral, the biggest source of revenue among Trump's 17 golf properties, appears to have been struggling since before he became President. Financial disclosure reports filed by the President show revenue is barely growing, up just $1 million last year, to $76 million. The Trump Organization itself has admitted it was struggling, arguing in a tax appeal to local authorities last year that it is \"seriously underperforming.\"\n\nThe Doral, which Trump purchased out of bankruptcy in 2012 for a reported $150 million, also faces a heavy debt load. At the end of last year, Trump had two mortgages on the resort, one for more than $50 million and another for as much as $25 million.\n\nNoah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, stated, \"The president is now officially using the power of his office to help prop up his struggling golf business.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, among the Democrats in Congress who have sued the President over the emoluments issue, saw it as a troubling development. \"It's so brazen and craven,\" he said. \"It's virtually saying, 'To heck with the rule of law.'\" Added U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, \"The emolument clauses of the Constitution exist to prevent exactly this kind of corruption.\"\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to questions about Doral's finances. Instead, it issued a statement saying that it is \"excited to have been asked to host\" the summit and \"honored by this recognition.\"",
    " Title: Michael Cohen to Serve Remainder of Prison Sentence in Home Confinement Due to Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's former lawyer and longtime fixer Michael Cohen will be released from federal prison to serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement due to the coronavirus pandemic. Cohen is currently incarcerated at FCI Otisville in New York after pleading guilty to numerous charges, including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. He will remain under quarantine for 14 days before his release. Federal statistics show 14 inmates and seven staff members at the prison have tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nAfter his release, Cohen will serve the remainder of his sentence at home. This decision was made following a directive from Attorney General William Barr, who ordered the Bureau of Prisons to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates.\n\nAs of Thursday, 473 federal inmates and 279 Bureau of Prisons staff members had tested positive for the coronavirus at facilities across the U.S. Eighteen inmates have died since late March. Many federal inmates have been seeking home confinement as the number of coronavirus cases grows in the federal prison system, but advocates have accused the Bureau of Prisons of moving too slowly to release inmates. The Bureau of Prisons said it had moved more than 1,000 inmates to home confinement since March 26, when Barr first issued a directive to increase its use.\n\nA federal judge had previously denied Cohen's attempt for an early release to home confinement after serving 10 months in prison. However, the Bureau of Prisons can take action to move him to home confinement without a judicial order.\n\nOther high-profile inmates have also been released as the number of coronavirus cases soars. Last week, a judge ordered Michael Avenatti, the attorney who rose to fame representing porn star Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump, to be temporarily freed from a federal jail in New York City and stay at a friend's house in Los Angeles. Avenatti had said he was at high risk of getting the coronavirus because he had a recent bout with pneumonia and his cellmate at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan was removed due to flu-like symptoms.\n\nFormer New York state Senate leader Dean Skelos, 72, who was also serving a sentence at Otisville, is also expected to be released soon from prison to home confinement after testing positive for the coronavirus, prosecutors told a judge Wednesday. CNN first reported Cohen was being released to home confinement. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment.",

In an interview with the Washington Post, Trump stated, \"I like Paul, but these are horrible times for our country. We need very, very strong leadership. And I'm just not quite there yet. I'm not quite there yet.\"\n\nTrump's words appear to be a reference to Ryan's comments in May, when the House speaker was asked if he was backing Trump. Ryan responded, \"I'm just not ready to do that at this point. I'm not there right now.\"\n\nIn addition to Ryan and McCain, Trump also refused to endorse the party's 2008 nominee in his bid for re-election. Both Ryan and McCain are longtime critics of many of Trump's remarks, but both have said they would support the Republican nominee in the general election.\n\nRyan's campaign responded through a spokesman, Zack Roday, who said, \"Neither Speaker Ryan nor anyone on his team has ever asked for Donald Trump's endorsement. And we are confident in a victory next week regardless.\"\n\nIn recent months, both Ryan and McCain have been critical of Trump following a string of racially and religiously charged statements. In June, Ryan described Trump's attacks on a federal judge, Gustavo Curiel, as \"the textbook definition of a racist comment,\" and McCain issued a strong rebuke of Trump's remarks about the Muslim family of a dead army captain.\n\nRyan also criticized Trump for his comments, saying, \"Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice.\" He added, \"Captain Khan was one such brave example.\"\n\nEven Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor and a Trump ally, broke rank to tell reporters that Trump's remarks on the Khan family were inappropriate. Christie told a press conference, \"I didn't see Mr. Khan's speech at the DNC but I'll just say this: I'm a father and I just can't imagine the pain of losing a child under any circumstances. For Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the pain of losing their son while defending our country is unfathomable, and I think it gives them the right to say whatever they want, whether they're right or wrong.\"\n\nTwo weeks after a party convention that attempted to focus on party unity, new rifts are appearing between Republicans and their candidate. On Tuesday, the retiring New York representative Richard Hanna became the first Republican member of Congress to say he would vote for Hillary Clinton in November, saying of Trump, \"He is unfit to serve our party and can not lead this country.\"\n\nLater the same day, the Hewlett-Packard executive Meg Whitman, a prominent Republican fundraiser, also threw her support behind Clinton. \"Donald Trump's demagoguery has undermined the fabric of our national character,\" she said.\n\nThey join dozens of high-profile GOP leaders who have previously said they would not vote for Trump, including the party's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, and the former Florida governor Jeb Bush. With the Khan row ongoing, the New York Times reported that mass defections by Republican politicians were now a possibility.\n\nIn his harshest comments about Trump yet, President Barack Obama on Tuesday described him as \"unfit\" and \"woefully unprepared\" to be president, urging Republican party leaders to take the unprecedented step of denouncing their nominee.\n\nAway from the frontline of politics, veterans and the families of soldiers killed in war continue to call on Trump to apologize for his treatment of the Khan family. Dakota Meyer, one of a handful of living Medal of Honor recipients and the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin's son-in-law, wrote Tuesday on Twitter, \"If @realDonaldTrump wants to be the Commander in Chief, he needs to act like one. And that can't start until he apologizes to the Khans.\"\n\nTrump's refusal to support McCain and Ryan comes exactly one week before Ryan faces a primary challenge from the businessman Paul Nehlen, a candidate who has sought to emulate Trump's rhetoric and policies. Nehlen has branded Ryan \"a soulless globalist\" and attacked him as the candidate of open borders.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump praised Nehlen for running \"a very good campaign.\"\n\nMcCain is also facing a primary challenge at the end of August from Kelli Ward, a former Arizona state senator who has accused the 2008 Republican nominee of being \"directly responsible for ISIS.\" If the five-term senator manages to fend off the primary challenge, he still faces a competitive general election against the Democratic representative Ann Kirkpatrick, in what McCain has described as \"the race of my life.\"\n\nAlthough Arizona was once solidly Republican, the heavily Latino state is now considered an electoral toss-up because of Trump's unpredictable effect on candidates whose names follow his own on the ballot. For over a year, McCain has also called on Trump to apologize for saying he prefers \"people who weren't captured\" to prisoners of war, like the senator was himself in Vietnam. Trump has not apologized.",
    " Title: Greece Agrees to New $96 Billion Bailout, Implementing Economic Reforms Under Supervision\n\nArticle:\n\nEurope has proposed a new $96 billion bailout for Greece, marking the country's third financial aid package since 2010. The agreement, which requires approval from Greece's Parliament by Wednesday, aims to secure Greece's place in the Eurozone and prevent a potential exit that could have destabilized the continent.\n\nGreece has agreed to significant economic reforms, including pension cuts, higher taxes, and the sale of some government assets. The deal hinges on Greece's commitment to follow through with these measures.\n\nEurozone leaders, led by Donald Tusk, have agreed in principle to start negotiations on the bailout. Greece's Parliament must approve the measures, and Europe will assign monitors to ensure that Greece will also have to give up control of the proceeds from government sales, with the bulk being earmarked for debt payments.\n\nGreece had sought to have some of its massive debt load canceled, but Europe rejected this request, stating that it would consider easing the terms with longer grace periods. The deal is still a proposal and could face resistance in Greece's Parliament.\n\nGreece urgently needs the European Central Bank to restart money flows to reopen its shuttered banks. However, the ECB has not yet indicated readiness to do so. Finance officials will reconvene later Monday to discuss supporting Greece while the details of the bailout are being negotiated.\n\nThe economy has deteriorated sharply in recent weeks, further damaging Greece's already fragile finances. There was a complete breakdown in trust between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and other European leaders due to a series of U-turns and his decision to call a referendum to reject reforms, only to sign up to them days later.\n\nUnder pressure from skeptical voters, some European leaders wanted ironclad guarantees that they would not be throwing good money after bad. Europe and the IMF have already lent Greece about 233 billion euros since 2010.\n\nThe agreement requires Greece to give access to bailout monitors on the ground in Athens, including officials from the IMF, a point Tsipras resisted. The deal will raise questions about whether Tsipras can continue in his post.\n\nWithout a new bailout, Tsipras knew Greece's economic situation would worsen, bringing the country ever closer to exit from the Eurozone. Greece's banks have been shut for two weeks, and cash withdrawals are capped. The vital tourism industry is suffering, and the healthcare system is running out of imported medicines.\n\nGreece needs to pay pensions and wages this week and make a significant debt repayment to the European Central Bank next week. Without an injection of funds quickly, it would have to issue IOUs, a first step to printing its own currency.\n\nAssuming Greece accepts a broader overhaul of the economy, there are still other potential roadblocks standing in the way of a third bailout. A handful of other eurozone countries, including Germany and Finland, will need to win votes in their parliaments this week on a new rescue. Only then can formal negotiations begin.",
    " Title: 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidates' Stances on Abortion Revealed in New York Times Survey\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have coalesced around an abortion rights agenda more far-reaching than any past nominees, according to a survey by The New York Times. The positions reflect a significant shift on one of the country's most politically divisive issues.\n\nAmong the top-tier candidates, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and Bernie Sanders want to force all private insurers to cover elective abortions and make the abortion drugs misoprostol and mifepristone available over the counter. Joe Biden did not provide an answer to either of these questions.\n\nAll candidates favor repealing the Hyde amendment to provide unlimited taxpayer funding of elective abortions for Medicaid recipients. Only South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg says, as a practical matter, he'd be willing to sign a budget that includes the Hyde amendment, while the other candidates dodge the question.\n\nThe Times reports that only Tulsi Gabbard, Joe Sestak, and Marianne Williamson now say abortion should be \"safe, legal, and rare\" - a phrase popularized by President Bill Clinton and repeated by Hillary Clinton, which reflected a search for common ground with people not fully supportive of abortion rights. Other candidates prefer to call for abortion to be \"affordable\" or \"accessible\" rather than \"rare.\"\n\nPerhaps most striking of all, the Times reports: \"Asked if they supported restrictions after 24 weeks - roughly when a healthy fetus can survive outside the womb, though viability varies from pregnancy to pregnancy - only Mr. Sestak said yes. (Ms. Gabbard, who did not complete the survey, has also said she supports restrictions in the third trimester.)\"\n\nComparing the 2020 Democrats with the last Democratic presidential candidate who won the White House, here's what Barack Obama told a Christian magazine in 2008 after he had effectively wrapped up the nomination:\n\n\"I have repeatedly said that I think it's entirely appropriate for states to restrict or even prohibit late-term abortions as long as there is a strict, well-defined exception for the health of the mother. Now, I don't think that'mental distress' qualifies as the health of the mother. I think it has to be a serious physical issue that arises in pregnancy, where there are real, significant problems to the mother carrying that child to term.\"\n\nThe only thing Joe Biden has going for him is his association with Barack Obama, but he is apparently unwilling to now associate himself with Obama's position on abortion in 2008. In the 1990s, Biden said he would like to \"ban all post-viability abortions,\" but now his campaign is dodging the question on whether he supports any restrictions on aborting viable babies. The rest of the top-tier candidates - Buttigieg, Warren, and Sanders - forthrightly oppose any restrictions after 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIt's quite odd that Tulsi Gabbard thinks abortion should sometimes be restricted after 28 weeks (the start of the third trimester), but she will not say if she supports restrictions after 24 weeks. The third-trimester distinction is a relic of the medical capabilities of the 1970s. When a plurality of Supreme Court justices declared in the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision in 1992 that there is a right to abortion after viability, they wrote that the \"soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs at approximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of Roe, at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some moment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future.\" (As the Times has acknowledged in earlier articles, viability has now moved up to 22 weeks into pregnancy.)\n\nOut of all the candidates running for president in 2020, only Joe Sestak (a candidate most Democrats have never heard of) is willing to tell the Times he favors some modest legal restrictions on abortion after viability.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Threaten to Let Bush-Era Tax Cuts Expire, Citing Fiscal Cliff Consequences\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats have indicated a willingness to let the Bush-era tax cuts expire at the end of the year, potentially triggering what is commonly referred to in Washington as the \"fiscal cliff.\" This move could occur if Republicans do not agree to President Obama's plan to increase taxes on top earners.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, made these remarks during an address Monday afternoon at the Brookings Institution. If all the tax cuts expire, it would diminish the Republican argument that the Democratic plan constitutes a tax hike, as any change to the tax code in 2013 would be considered a tax cut.\n\nThe fiscal cliff refers to the approaching deadline at the start of 2013, when the Bush tax cuts are set to expire, and billions of dollars in automatic spending cuts\u2014resulting from last summer's debt-ceiling debate\u2014are set to take effect. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are hoping to reallocate these spending cuts to spare key areas like defense, and to temporarily extend the Bush tax rates for at least some Americans. Some have warned that failure to do so could send the nation back into recession.\n\nMurray stated that if a balanced deal, which calls for the wealthy to pay their fair share, is not reached, Democrats will continue the debate into 2013 rather than locking in a long-term deal this year that would allegedly disadvantage middle-class families.\n\nMurray also suggested that if the automatic spending cuts, known as the \"sequestration,\" set to take effect at the start of next year, are not negotiated to her party's liking, her party would let those cuts happen as well.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, claim that Democrats are the ones standing in the way of relief for millions of Americans. In the Republicans' weekly radio address, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) accused Obama of pushing a tax hike that will hurt employment. The political strategy underscores the heated debate over the Bush tax cuts and the potential risks for the American people.",
    " Title: Al Franken Advocates for Transparency in Surveillance Programs\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Al Franken has expressed concerns about the lack of transparency regarding the scope and legal authorities of U.S. surveillance programs. In a statement, Franken emphasized the need for a balance between national security and privacy, stating that Americans cannot make informed decisions about the protection of their civil liberties if the details of surveillance are kept secret.\n\nFranken, who has been working to increase transparency in surveillance programs since joining the Senate, has supported amendments to the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that would require more public reporting on the use of surveillance authorities and greater disclosures about the legal opinions and safeguards that support them.\n\nWhen these amendments failed, Franken voted against renewing both the Patriot Act and FISA. He clarified that his vote was not a rejection of the programs themselves, but rather a call for increased transparency. Franken believes that these programs protect the country and have saved lives, but he argues that the lack of transparency undermines public trust and the ability of the electorate to hold the government accountable.\n\nFranken is currently working on legislation that would require the federal government to annually report on how it uses key authorities under the Patriot Act and FISA, including the authorities underlying the phone metadata and PRISM electronic surveillance programs. The government would be required to disclose how many Americans' information is being collected and how many Americans' information is being queried and actually seen by federal officers or agents.\n\nIn addition, Franken's legislation would allow companies to publicly report on how many Patriot and FISA orders they receive and how many of their customers these orders affect. Franken argues that this level of transparency can be achieved without harming national security, citing Google's reporting on the number of national security letters it receives as an example.\n\nAs chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, Franken is committed to ensuring that privacy laws keep pace with technology. He believes that, in light of recent disclosures, it is long overdue for a public conversation about what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy. Franken contends that it is impossible to have this debate when the details of surveillance programs are kept secret.",
    " Title: White Nationalist Protesters Return to Charlottesville Two Months After Deadly Clashes\n\nArticle:\n\nWhite nationalist protesters have returned to the US town of Charlottesville two months after a violent clash that resulted in a woman's death. The town's mayor, Michael Signer, described the protesters' appearance at the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee as \"another despicable visit by neo-Nazi cowards.\"\n\nThe brief torch-lit rally, organized by far-right figure Richard Spencer, took place in Emancipation Park, where the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee is located. The statue was also the venue for the \"Unite the Right\" rally in August, which was held to oppose plans to remove it. Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old counter-demonstrator, was killed when a participant drove into a group of counter-protesters at high speed during the August rally.\n\nBetween 40 and 50 people are thought to have attended the rally in Emancipation Park. The statue of General Lee is currently covered up while a legal challenge to its removal takes place. In a video live-streamed by Mr. Spencer, he stated that Charlottesville had become a symbol of the suppression of free speech and the destruction of historical monuments.\n\nIn the video, the group, all dressed similarly and holding lit torches, could be heard chanting \"the south will rise again\" and \"Russia is our friend.\" Another speaker said the group was there to \"represent white America's interests\" and criticized the local community and the media. Police reported that the group left the park shortly before 20:00 (0:00 GMT). Mayor Signer stated that officials were looking at legal ways to prevent further events.\n\nRichard Spencer is the founder of a right-wing website and think-tank and has made a series of controversial comments at public events, including allegedly advocating \"peaceful\" ethnic cleansing. The US has been embroiled in a national debate on whether to remove Confederate symbols from the US civil war due to their association with slavery. After the violence in Charlottesville, many local governments acted to remove Confederate monuments.",
    " Title: Judge Dismisses Claims Against Exxon Mobil in New York Climate Change Lawsuit\n\nArticle:\n\nA New York State Supreme Court judge has ruled in favor of Exxon Mobil in a climate change lawsuit, marking a significant victory for the oil giant. The decision was a setback for the New York Attorney General's Office, which brought the case.\n\nJustice Barry Ostrager, in his ruling, stated that the attorney general's office failed to prove that Exxon Mobil had violated any laws. Ostrager wrote, \"Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve ExxonMobil from responsibility for contributing to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gasses in the production of its fossil fuel products.\" However, he added, \"this is a securities fraud case, not a climate change case.\"\n\nIn a three-week trial, New York state prosecutors argued that the oil company had downplayed the financial risks it faces from potential climate regulation. Attorney General Letitia James stated that doing so made Exxon's assets appear more secure than they really were, which in turn affected its share price and defrauded investors.\n\nOstrager concluded that James' office \"failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that ExxonMobil made any material misrepresentations that 'would have been viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the 'total mix' of information made available.\"\n\nFollowing the verdict, James released a statement, saying that the case had compelled Exxon \"to answer publicly for their internal decisions that misled investors.\" James also said, \"Exxon's inability to tell the truth further underscores the lies that have been sold to the American public for decades.\"\n\nExxon said the ruling \"affirms the position ExxonMobil has held throughout the New York Attorney General's baseless investigation. We provided our investors with accurate information on the risks of climate change.\" The company also stated, \"Lawsuits that waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of climate change.\"\n\nThe state's case showed signs of weakness. On the last day of the trial, the attorney general's office withdrew two counts of fraud from its lawsuit. Exxon asked the judge to rule on those counts anyway, saying the state had tarnished the company's reputation in making its case on them.\n\nThe state went forward with two counts based on the Martin Act, a New York statute that grants the state's attorney general the authority to pursue investigations and actions against those suspected of securities fraud. The Martin Act has a lower burden of proof: Prosecutors must show that a company made misrepresentations to investors and that there were consequences.\n\nOstrager minced no words in describing how he thought the trial had gone: \"The testimony of the expert witnesses called by the Office of the Attorney General was eviscerated on cross-examination and by ExxonMobil's expert witnesses.\" Ostrager's ruling found Exxon not liable on any of the counts.\n\nThe highest-profile witness in the landmark case was former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Exxon's CEO from 2006 to 2017. Exxon used two methods to estimate the impact of potential climate-change regulations on its future business. Tillerson testified that one assessment was used to estimate the effect of future climate change regulation\u2014such as a carbon tax\u2014on the global energy system. For specific projects, such as the Alberta oil sands in Canada, the company would use a different method of calculating a \"greenhouse gas cost.\"\n\nTillerson insisted that this was appropriate, and that Exxon had no incentive to underestimate carbon costs internally, since \"we'd be misinforming ourselves.\"\n\nExxon battled for years to prevent this case and others from reaching trial, but there are now numerous pending lawsuits against Exxon and other oil companies, including a similar case that was recently brought in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healey accuses ExxonMobil of systematically misleading investors about climate change's impact on the economy and its own business, and of deceiving consumers about fossil fuel's environmental impact.\n\nElsewhere, many city and state governments are using \"public nuisance\" arguments to try to hold energy companies accountable for their role in climate change. The idea is to force them to help pay for the mounting impact of climate change that communities now struggle to address. Fossil fuel companies often attempt to get the cases moved to federal courts, which they believe will be more sympathetic to their side.",
    " Title: Obama Proposes Lifting 2013 Spending Caps, Adds Billions in New Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has unveiled a $3.99 trillion budget proposal for the 2016 fiscal year, which aims to lift the automatic spending caps imposed in 2013 and increase government spending in various areas. The proposal, which is already drawing criticism from Republicans, includes tens of billions of dollars in new spending for domestic programs and defense.\n\nIn a speech at the Department of Homeland Security, President Obama stated, \"I'm not going to accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward... It would be bad for our security and bad for our growth.\" He emphasized the need to end sequestration and reverse the cuts to domestic priorities in 2016, and to match the investments made domestically with increases in defense spending.\n\nThe president's budget proposal calls for an additional $37 billion in spending on domestic programs, which would fund initiatives such as an expanded child care tax credit and subsidies for community college tuition. The plan also includes an extra $38 billion in defense spending, with the funds intended for the ongoing fight against the Islamic State and military support for NATO allies affected by Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nTo offset these costs, President Obama has proposed higher taxes on big banks and the wealthy. The plan would raise approximately $210 billion over the next decade by increasing the capital gains tax rate and taxing gains on inherited wealth. A new financial fee on highly leveraged banks would generate an additional $110 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThe president is also proposing a one-time, 14 percent tax on the profits that U.S. corporations have amassed overseas, which is expected to raise an estimated $238 billion for improvements to roads, bridges, and other public works.\n\nRepublicans, who now control both chambers of Congress, are unlikely to approve the president's proposed tax hikes. However, they may be willing to negotiate on the spending caps. Cory Fritz, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, stated, \"Republicans believe there are smarter ways to cut spending than the sequester and have passed legislation to replace it multiple times, only to see the president continue to demand tax hikes.\"\n\nThe president's budget would reduce the federal deficit to $474 billion in the upcoming fiscal year, which is just 2.5 percent of the overall economy. White House forecasters expect the deficit to remain at a manageable 3 percent of GDP or less throughout the 10-year budget window. However, this assumes substantial increases in tax revenues, which may be difficult to achieve given the Republican-controlled Congress's opposition to tax hikes.\n\nOne idea that has been removed from the budget is a plan to tax 529 college savings accounts. This proposal faced opposition from both Republicans and Democrats, as critics argue that the tax-advantaged accounts primarily benefit upper-income families.\n\nA preliminary analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that while the wealthiest Americans would pay higher taxes under the president's plan, most of the benefits would go to those at the bottom of the income ladder. The 60 percent of Americans in the middle would more or less break even.\n\nPresident Obama has described his budget as an exercise in \"middle-class economics.\" However, the Tax Policy Center's analysis suggests that the majority of the benefits would accrue to lower-income Americans. The budget proposal is now under review by Congress, and negotiations between the White House and Republican lawmakers are expected to continue in the coming months.",

Ajjawi, a 17-year-old Palestinian resident of Tyre, Lebanon, has had his education at Harvard, considered one of the world's preeminent universities, put in doubt after being detained and deported by American immigration officials at Boston Logan International Airport last Friday.\n\nUpon arrival, Ajjawi faced questioning from immigration officials, along with several other international students. While the other students were allowed to leave, Ajjawi alleges that an immigration officer continued to question him about his religion and religious practices in Lebanon. The same officer then asked him to unlock his phone and laptop and left to search them for approximately five hours, Ajjawi alleges. After the search, the officer questioned him about his friends' social media activity.\n\nIn a statement, Ajjawi wrote, \"Upon arrival, I faced questioning from immigration officials along with several other international students.

The details of the immigration officer's actions and the reasons for Ajjawi's deportation are currently unavailable.",
    " Title: Trump Delivers Harsh Indictment of Media in Unprecedented White House News Conference\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an extraordinary news conference, President Donald Trump delivered a harsh indictment of the media, marking one of the most critical addresses from the White House in recent history. The event, described as riveting, saw Trump criticizing the media for what he perceived as biased and inaccurate reporting.\n\nTrump's speech was met with mixed reactions, with supporters viewing it as a brilliant takedown of a corrupt media, while opponents considered it a display of crazed or unhinged behavior, as CNN anchor Jake Tapper put it.\n\nThe president touched on various topics, including the issue of leaks, media bias, and the tone of his coverage. He justified his complaints about an unprecedented flood of illegal leaks aimed at damaging him. However, he did not dispute the accuracy of reports, such as The Washington Post's account of Michael Flynn's past contacts with the Russian ambassador, which led to Flynn's dismissal.\n\nTrump also criticized the tone of his coverage, which he described as unrelentingly negative. He took particular issue with a Wall Street Journal report that some spies are withholding sensitive intelligence from him, stating that the paper never called him. The story's fourth paragraph quoted a White House official denying the allegations.\n\nTrump's comments on CNN and its host Don Lemon were particularly pointed, although he did not mention Lemon by name. He accused CNN of having anti-Trump panels, a claim that remains subjective.\n\nWhat was most revealing, in regard to CNN and the media more generally, was Trump's assertion that some journalists have \"hatred\" for him. He has expressed similar grievances about his coverage since 2015, but as the commander-in-chief, these feelings are now more significant.\n\nTrump's ability to improve his press coverage can be enhanced by accomplishing some of the big-ticket items on his agenda, marking a shift from the focus on media criticism to real news, not fake.",
    " Title: Colorado Court Upholds Employer's Right to Fire Medical Marijuana User for Positive Test\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a ruling on Thursday, the Colorado Court of Appeals upheld an employer's right to terminate an employee who tests positive for marijuana, even if the employee is a medical marijuana user. The court's decision overturns a state law that protects employees from being fired for engaging in lawful activities outside of their jobs.\n\nThe case in question involves Brandon Coats, a medical marijuana user who was rendered quadriplegic after a car accident and qualified for Colorado's medical marijuana program. Coats was fired by Dish Network after testing positive for marijuana, with no evidence that he was intoxicated at work.\n\nCoats sued Dish Network to regain his job, arguing that a Colorado law protected him from being fired for engaging in lawful activities outside of the workplace. However, the district court ruled against Coats, stating that Dish was able to terminate Coats due to federal laws against marijuana. The Colorado Court of Appeals upheld that ruling on Thursday.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Judge Janice Davidson wrote, \"We can find no legislative intent to extend employment protections to those engaged in activities that violate federal law.\"\n\nCoats and his lawyer have stated that they will take the case as high as the Colorado Supreme Court. Michael Evans, Coats' lawyer, told Reuters, \"If someone's going to pick a fight with the federal government, it will be the state supreme court and not the court of appeals.\"\n\nColorado is one of 20 states (not including the District of Columbia) that has legalized marijuana for medicinal use. In November, both Colorado and Washington voted to legalize marijuana for recreational use as well. However, marijuana remains illegal under federal law, which trumps state laws in this case.",
    " Title: Virginia Gubernatorial Candidates Court Diverse Voters Ahead of Off-Cycle Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the off-cycle Virginia gubernatorial election, Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe and Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli have made numerous campaign stops, focusing on reaching out to the state's rapidly diversifying electorate.\n\nDuring a campaign stop at Todos Supermarket in Woodbridge, Virginia, McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, expressed support for a state-level DREAM Act, emphasizing the importance of an open and welcoming state for all residents. He also highlighted the supermarket's San Salvador-born owner, Carlos Castro, as an example of the \"American dream.\"\n\nMcAuliffe's campaign itinerary includes numerous events aimed at diverse communities, such as toasting the Lunar New Year with Korean, Chinese, and Vietnamese groups, celebrating the Persian New Year holiday of Nowruz, addressing the Democratic Latino Organization of Virginia, and holding a special campaign kickoff aimed at the Asian-American and Pacific-Islander communities.\n\nCuccinelli, the Republican candidate, has also focused on outreach efforts, attending meetings with the Pakistan American Business Association and the Moroccan American Network, celebrating Filipino-American culture at festivals in Richmond and Virginia Beach, and giving interviews to Indian, Korean, Moroccan, and Vietnamese-oriented media, among other outreach events.\n\nThe political logic behind these itineraries is rooted in the significant increase in nonwhite voting groups in Virginia over the past decade. In the 2004 presidential race, Latino voters made up 3% and Asians made up 2% of the Virginia electorate, according to exit polls. By 2012, those numbers had risen to 5% for Latinos and 3% for Asians\u2014a combined 60% increase in these heterogeneous groups. In a low-turnout election, this shift could be particularly impactful.\n\nCuccinelli, who has won multiple state Senate elections in a Fairfax-based district, near the epicenter of Virginia's demographic change, has emphasized his long ties to the state and his involvement in local institutions. He has also highlighted his focus on creating jobs and his opposition to quotas, while advocating for internationally savvy constituencies to be better represented in the state's economic development agencies and boards.\n\nThe national conversation on immigration has cast a shadow over Cuccinelli's campaign, and his outreach meeting in Richmond served as a case study in both his strengths and limitations as an aspiring big-tent GOP leader. Cuccinelli emphasized his long ties to the state and his involvement in local institutions, contrasting that with McAuliffe's upbringing in national politics.",
    " Title: President Trump Vows to Protect Thanksgiving Name, Pardons Two Turkeys\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rally in Sunrise, Florida, on Tuesday, President Donald Trump pledged to protect the traditional name of the annual Thanksgiving holiday, stating that some individuals, whom he referred to as the \"radical left,\" want to change the name. Trump expressed his opposition to those who aim to target the secular holiday in a similar manner as they have with Christmas, which celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ.\n\n\"You know, some people want to change the name Thanksgiving,\" Trump said at the rally. \"They don't want to use the term 'Thanksgiving.' And that was true also with Christmas.\"\n\nThe president went on to say, \"But now we're going to have to do a little work on Thanksgiving. People have different ideas. Why it shouldn't be called Thanksgiving. But everybody in this room, I know, loves the name Thanksgiving. And we're not changing.\"\n\nThe HuffPost earlier this month raised questions about the environmental impact of the traditional Thanksgiving meal, suggesting alternatives such as skipping turkey to save animals, criticizing travel-related carbon emissions, and addressing food waste. This led to a series of reports on a supposed \"war on Thanksgiving\" by Fox News.\n\nTwitter users responded with the hashtag \"#WhatLiberalsCallThanksgiving\" to mock the president's remarks. One user, who identified as Native American, suggested instead naming the fourth Thursday of November a #nationaldayofmourning.\n\nSince 1970, Native Americans in New England have organized an annual protest on the same day as Thanksgiving, gathering at noon on Cole's Hill in Plymouth. The protest is known as the National Day of Mourning, and it serves as a reminder of the genocide of millions of Native American people, the theft of their lands, and the relentless assault on their culture, according to a plaque erected at the protest site by the Town of Plymouth on behalf of the United American Indians of New England.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Trump pardoned two Thanksgiving turkeys \u2013 Bread and Butter \u2013 and wished Americans a Happy Thanksgiving. The president joked that the two turkeys, specially raised by farmer Willie Jackson, had already received subpoenas to appear in the basement of Adam Schiff, the California Democrat leading the impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\n\"It seems the Democrats are accusing me of being too soft on turkey,\" Trump said, addressing the birds. \"But Bread and Butter, I should note that unlike previous witnesses, you and I have actually met.

    " Title: Target Corporation Drops Health Care Plan for Part-Time Workers, Cites Obamacare Exchanges\n\nArticle:\n\nRetail giant Target Corporation has announced its decision to discontinue its health care plan for part-time workers, citing low participation and suggesting that employees would benefit from coverage under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) insurance exchanges. In a blog post on Tuesday, the Minneapolis-based retailer stated that it will provide a $500 cash payment to each employee affected by the change.\n\nTarget presented the move as a sensible decision, but did not disclose the potential savings for the company. The company also implied that it was facilitating health care options for its part-time employees by stepping aside from the health care arena under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"The launch of health insurance marketplaces provides new options for health care coverage that we believe our part-time team members may prefer,\" the company stated in the blog post, which featured its top human resources official. \"In fact, by offering them insurance, we could actually disqualify many of them from being eligible for newly available subsidies that could reduce their overall health insurance expense.\"\n\nThe company reported that less than 10% of its employees participate in the company's health care plan for part-timers, but the move raises questions about the impact of the Affordable Care Act on employer-based coverage, which is the primary source of health insurance for a majority of Americans. Analysts suggest that employers may opt to move health care coverage into the individual market and state-based exchanges, where individuals may be eligible for government subsidies based on income.\n\nTarget is not the first company to make changes to its health care plan in response to the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. In August, UPS announced that it would drop health care coverage for approximately 15,000 employees' spouses who are eligible for coverage from their own workplaces. The company stated that the move was necessary to control health care costs, given the fees and minimum coverage requirements under Obamacare.\n\nThe impact of Obamacare on the employer-based market is complex, as it involves numerous factors that affect annual premium changes. However, given the political climate and the early problems with HealthCare.gov and the individual market, many critics may attribute any premium increases to the law.\n\nAnalysts have stated that smaller employers face the most significant consequences because they are less able to handle adverse changes to the balance of sick and healthy employees than larger firms can. This is a pressing concern because the law prohibits insurers from rejecting people with pre-existing conditions and from charging older consumers more than young people by more than a 3-1 ratio.\n\nAdditionally, the health care overhaul includes numerous taxes and fees that may be passed along to consumers in the employer-based insurance market.\n\nTarget stated that employees who work 20 to 31 hours would still be eligible for vacation, dental, disability, life insurance, and 401(k) benefits. The company also stated that it had no plans to reduce hours as part of the move.\n\n\"At any time, our team members can talk to their manager about their interest and availability to work more hours,\" the company stated. \"In fact, during the holiday season, we offered our year-round part-time and full-time [employees] the opportunity to take on additional hours or cross-train to work in other areas\u2014at their request.\"\n\nHouse Republicans recently cited the millions of Target customers who had to monitor their bank accounts after hackers stole their credit card numbers as they sought support for an Obamacare Web privacy law. The law, which requires the federal government to notify consumers within two days if their personal data has been breached on online-based insurance markets tied to the health care overhaul, was passed with the help of 67 Democrats.",
    " Title: Obama Campaigns in New Hampshire, Addresses Second Term Agenda and Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn Manchester, New Hampshire, President Barack Obama addressed a crowd of approximately 6,000 supporters on Thursday, aiming to counter criticism from Republican nominee Mitt Romney regarding the lack of a clear agenda for a second term. The race in this small but crucial swing state is tightening, with a Suffolk/7News poll on Monday showing the candidates tied at 47 percent.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Obama led Romney by an average of 6 percentage points in New Hampshire. The Suffolk poll suggests that voters are uncertain about Obama's plans for a second term, with Romney receiving a slight edge in terms of fixing the economy (45 percent to 42 percent).\n\nThe president's campaign team has outlined an agenda for a second term, which includes hiring 100,000 more teachers, boosting domestic energy production, creating more manufacturing jobs, and cutting the deficit. Obama also argued that his second term would serve as a bulwark against repeating the mistakes made by his Republican predecessors.\n\nObama highlighted his achievements, such as reducing unemployment from 10 percent to 7.8 percent, and emphasized the need to continue progress. However, it is worth noting that the national jobless rate was 7.6 percent when Obama took office.\n\nThe president attempted to clarify his vision for the future, discussing subsidized college tuition, increased U.S. exports, raising taxes on the wealthy, and promoting clean energy. Despite these efforts, it appears that his message is not always resonating with the public.\n\nRon Chito, a supporter from Medford, Massachusetts, stated, \"Not really\" when asked if the president has done a good job describing his vision for a second term. Chito, a retired utility worker, expressed hope for more Democratic representation in the House and Senate to pass a good jobs bill.\n\nCynthia Malbon, a supporter from Manchester, plans to vote for Obama but expressed skepticism about his ability to achieve a stronger economy. She expressed a desire for more specifics on how Obama plans to accomplish this.\n\nThroughout his speech, Obama criticized Romney's economic plan, which includes across-the-board tax cuts for all wage earners. He also addressed the impact of Romney's policies on women's health, stating that Romney would repeal \"Obamacare,\" potentially allowing insurance companies to charge women more for healthcare coverage.\n\nThe president emphasized the importance of women's health issues in the election, stating that the health care law passed by his administration puts health care choices in the hands of individuals, while Romney's approach would give employers control over such decisions.\n\nObama also criticized the Republican-led New Hampshire legislature on women's health, stating that they sometimes act as if they know better than women when it comes to women's own health care decisions. He also mentioned Romney's stance on funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe president stated his intention to cut the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years, but this would require higher taxes on families earning more than $250,000. He emphasized that he would not cut education or research that contributes to economic growth.\n\nThe Romney campaign responded, stating that Obama's leadership has failed over the past four years and that the economic future under him would be bleaker due to his unwillingness to confront the \"fiscal cliff\" of spending cuts and tax increases pending before Congress in January. The campaign also emphasized Romney's plan to create 12 million jobs and restore the economy.",
    " Title: President Obama Delivers Unifying Speech at Democratic National Convention, Outlines Modest Policy Goals and Criticizes Mitt Romney\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama delivered a speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday, outlining his case for a second term. The speech, which took place in Charlotte, North Carolina, was characterized by a more subdued tone compared to his 2008 speech in Denver.\n\nIn his address, President Obama referenced the transformational legacy of Franklin D. Roosevelt to justify his reelection bid. However, the speech also reflected the more cautious approach of a sitting president, as he urged a wary and concerned electorate to maintain the current course to avoid a Mitt Romney presidency.\n\nUnlike some Democrats' expectations, President Obama did not present an affirmative rationale for reelection rooted in ambitious policy proposals. Instead, he offered a blend of cautious optimism, harsh criticisms of Mitt Romney's foreign policy inexperience, and relatively modest policy goals, such as a pledge to create 1 million new manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe speech focused on portraying Romney as evading tough decisions and intensifying attacks on his opponent's record, which have primarily been waged through media outlets.\n\nPresident Obama launched a scathing attack on Romney from various perspectives, particularly on foreign policy, a weakness for Obama in 2008 but a stronger electoral ground for a seasoned commander in chief. He criticized Romney for his perceived lack of diplomacy, citing his comments on the ending of the Iraq war and his stance on the Olympics.\n\nThe economic and political realities of the 2012 election year necessitated some messaging improvisation and significant downsizing of the blue-sky appeal of his 2008 campaign. President Obama acknowledged the challenges faced in solving issues that have accumulated over decades and emphasized the need for collective effort, shared responsibility, and bold, persistent experimentation.\n\nOver the past two years, Obama's advisers have grappled with a fundamental messaging dilemma: how to make the case for reelection on a half-recovery, and how to communicate what he has done for the American people without claiming that he has made everything better.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Unveil Police Reform Bill Addressing Racial Disparities\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans, led by Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), have introduced legislation aimed at addressing racial disparities in law enforcement. The bill, titled the JUSTICE Act, was unveiled on June 17, 2020, at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe bill includes provisions to incentivize law enforcement agencies to ban the use of chokeholds, except when deadly force is authorized. It also aims to ramp up data collection efforts regarding officer-involved deaths or serious harm, provide federal funds for alternative force training, recognize the history of lynching in the United States, require law enforcement agencies to report on no-knock warrants to the attorney general, and establish a commission to study issues affecting Black men and boys.\n\nThe bill follows President Donald Trump's executive order, which incentivizes police departments to update their standards and strengthen efforts to track officer misconduct. The Republican bill aligns more closely with the president's actions than the comprehensive legislative proposal put forward by congressional Democrats last week.\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany stated that the bill has Trump's full support. She added, \"It's a great bill, it's more great action from Republicans, and we hope we can have bipartisan support on that.\"\n\nUnlike the Democrats' proposal, the Republican bill does not address the issue of qualified immunity, a doctrine that shields officers from legal liability unless a plaintiff can show that their constitutional rights were clearly violated. The Trump administration has stated that amending qualified immunity is a \"non-starter.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court announced on Monday that it would not hear cases addressing the doctrine of qualified immunity. The GOP proposal also does not end the use of \"no-knock\" warrants in drug cases, as the Democratic bill does, and it provides new funds for police department training.\n\nThe 106-page bill is spearheaded by GOP Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, one of three Black senators, and is backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky). Senator Scott stated at the Capitol Hill news conference, \"The bill speaks to the fact that we believe the overwhelming number of officers in this nation are good people.\"",
    " Title: Amazon Eliminates Monthly Bonuses and Stock Awards for Warehouse Workers as Part of $15 Minimum Wage Implementation\n\nArticle:\n\nAmazon.com Inc. has announced the elimination of monthly bonuses and stock awards for its warehouse workers and other hourly employees, following the company's pledge this week to raise pay to at least $15 per hour.\n\nPreviously, warehouse workers for the e-commerce giant in the U.S. were eligible for monthly bonuses that could amount to hundreds of dollars per month, as well as stock awards. The company informed these employees on Wednesday that it would discontinue both compensation categories to cover the costs of the wage increases, according to two individuals familiar with Amazon's pay policies.\n\nAmazon received praise when it announced on Monday its decision to raise minimum pay. The wage increase quelled criticism from politicians and activists, and positioned the company favorably for the recruitment of temporary workers during the crucial holiday shopping season.\n\nDespite the elimination of bonuses and stock awards, hourly operations and customer-service workers will see their total compensation increase, the company stated in a statement.\n\n\"In addition, because it's no longer incentive-based, the compensation will be more immediate and predictable,\" Amazon said.\n\nWorkers whose pay was already above $15 per hour will receive hourly raises of $1, according to two individuals familiar with the matter who requested anonymity regarding the company's compensation practices. Some long-time workers expressed dissatisfaction that their raises are smaller compared to newly hired workers who will see hourly pay increases of up to 40%.\n\nDavid DeBoskey, an accounting professor at San Diego State University, stated that a higher hourly wage that new workers immediately receive is a more effective recruiting tool in a tight labor market than stock options that take years to materialize, especially in the warehousing industry that experiences high turnover.\n\nAmazon plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers for the holiday rush this year, and temporary workers do not receive stock awards.\n\n\"In a tight labor market, when you're the leader paying $15 an hour, that's a big advantage,\" DeBoskey said. \"They probably realized people weren't applying for warehouse jobs for the stock options.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Meeting at White House Aims to Address DACA, Budget Deadline Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublicans and Democrats will convene at the White House on Tuesday for a bipartisan meeting with President Donald Trump, aiming to make progress on protecting hundreds of thousands of immigrants from deportation. However, a long-standing partisan divide over immigration policy and an approaching budget deadline pose challenges to the negotiations.\n\nAccording to Republican and Democratic negotiators involved in discussions over the January spending deal, DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) has become a key factor in unlocking any funding agreement. Some participants are frustrated with the current state of negotiations, with Republicans alleging that Democrats have effectively halted talks on spending caps until a resolution on DACA is reached.\n\nSenate Republican John Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2, expressed his view that Democrats are holding the spending deal hostage for DACA negotiations. \"We are meeting at the White House tomorrow on a bipartisan basis with the President to see what that might look like,\" said Cornyn, \"but I think that's going to make the January 19 date pretty hard to hit.\"\n\nNegotiations have been described as a \"mess\" by a person directly involved in the discussions. A separate GOP aide stated that the broader political environment for both parties is \"not in a good place right now.\"\n\nDemocrats argue that the White House has not been fully engaged in the negotiations and claim that a long and broad policy wish list released last week further irritated Democrats working on the immigration compromise. One Democratic aide described the White House's list as \"out of the realm of reality.\"\n\n\"No wall,\" said Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California. \"I believe in border security. I think it's very important that we have a secure border, but spending billions and billions of dollars on this wall because of a political promise and a campaign promise is ridiculous.\"\n\nThe anticipated meeting at the White House on Tuesday is expected to symbolize Trump's growing commitment to finding a bipartisan resolution. However, the inclusion of GOP lawmakers that Democrats view as openly hostile to finding a consensus deal on DACA adds tension to the meeting for Democrats.\n\nDetails are still being worked out on what a plan to help DACA recipients would look like, and a bipartisan group of Senate lawmakers led by Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois and Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina continues to negotiate. The tensions that existed in December but were temporarily resolved with a holiday deadline are now playing out in real time between the two parties.\n\n\"I think this is going to be the flexion point where we get some things done or we don't,\" said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, on Monday afternoon on CNN.\n\nBipartisan talks have been ongoing for months, and the group of senators led by Durbin and Graham acknowledge they need Trump to lay out clear priorities to move forward. The thinking is that Trump, who campaigned on promises of mass deportations and a border wall, can offer political cover for Republicans who may be fearful of backing any immigration bill viewed as amnesty among their base. With Trump's blessing, Republicans believe they can find a way to move ahead on DACA. Without it, the votes are compromised.\n\nThe bipartisan meeting at the White House on Tuesday follows Trump's meeting with Republicans last week, during which Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona refused to attend, citing the lack of bipartisanship. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, formerly the Secretary of Homeland Security, will also be in the bipartisan meeting on Tuesday and has been leading outreach to lawmakers on Capitol Hill on the ongoing talks.\n\nIn addition to the bipartisan working group, conservatives including Cornyn and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa are having their own conversations. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma will also be at the White House on Tuesday.\n\nIn the House, multiple efforts are underway, with Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas and Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California releasing their own bipartisan framework for a deal after weeks of negotiations. Aguilar is the whip for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. That deal focuses on DACA and border security, but the lawmakers hope additional measures could be added if necessary to finalize a deal.\n\nThe bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, including Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, a longtime DACA advocate, had also been working to reach a compromise before the break, similar in concept to what the Senate group was working on.\n\nAs in the Senate, a group of more conservative Republican lawmakers are working on their own proposal, including House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul of Texas and House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, which would be strongly to the right of most bipartisan compromises. Both men will also be at the White House on Tuesday.",
    " Title: Americans Offer Suggestions for President Obama's Second Term Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his second term, President Obama should focus on rebuilding the nation's infrastructure, according to Cherry Davis, a struggling job seeker in Los Angeles. Davis suggests a modern New Deal, which she believes would create jobs, update the nation's infrastructure, and bring the middle class back.\n\nEducation is another top concern for some Americans. Tyler Stocks, an Obama voter and rising East Carolina University student, expressed his worry about the rising costs of college tuition and textbooks. He hopes the president can work to ensure that students like him are afforded the opportunity to receive a good education.\n\nMark Ivy, who voted for Mitt Romney, believes that Obama's leadership skills need improvement, particularly in dealing with Congress. He thinks the president should focus on forging a way through the tangled web of Congress and displaying real leadership in his second term.\n\nSmall business owner Egberto Willies, a politically active Obama supporter, is concerned about the dwindling middle class and income and wealth inequality. He believes the tax structure should be changed to resolve these issues.\n\nThe issue of leadership and the president's approach to dealing with Congress has also been a topic of debate among iReporters and commenters. Some believe that a leader builds consensus by understanding that it is better to bring different viewpoints together for a common cause, rather than always wanting to win the argument.\n\nThe tax structure has also created a big conversation on CNN.com, as commenters went back and forth over corporate tax rates and how much taxes ought to be raised on the wealthy. The plight of the dwindling middle class, immigration, and gun control are other issues that have been raised by iReporters and commenters.\n\nCNN.com commenter Bruce Rubin stated, \"Unless this country goes back to a tax structure pre-Reagan, all but the top 1% is doomed.\" Small-business owner Egberto Willies added, \"The reality is none of the other issues matter if the decline of the middle class continues.\"\n\nThe article concludes by asking readers to share their thoughts below on which issues they believe ought to be the priority over the next term and whether iReporters and commenters missed the mark by not talking about the economy.",
    " Title: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: A Churchillian Statesman and His Iran Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIsraeli columnist Ari Shavit, author of \"My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel,\" describes Benjamin Netanyahu as a \"serious statesman\" with an \"extraordinary comprehension and uncanny foresight.\" Despite acknowledging Netanyahu's human flaws and problematic behavioral patterns, Shavit maintains that the Israeli prime minister is neither cynical, corrupt, nor facile, and possesses an \"unrealized potential for greatness.\"\n\nNetanyahu's self-perceived role, according to Shavit, is akin to Winston Churchill's, viewing himself as the savior of the West and Israel as the Great Britain of the 21st century. This perspective, rooted in Netanyahu's Zionist beliefs, has been shaped by non-Jewish philo-Zionists, primarily British, conservative, and imperialist.\n\nNetanyahu's Churchill complex, as described by Shavit, is deep, obsessive, and multidimensional. This complex is evident in Netanyahu's comparison of the Oslo Accords' ambitions to Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler in the 1930s and his current view of a nuclear deal with Iran in the same light.\n\nAs a result of this complex, Netanyahu scorns Democratic politicians and liberal intellectuals, viewing them as weak. He is not primarily concerned with social justice, human rights, or the rule of law, instead focusing on the perceived threat from Iran and the clash of cultures between Iran and the West.\n\nIn 2009, when Netanyahu took office, he defined his Churchillian mission as preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, achieving regional hegemony, and annihilating the Jews. Netanyahu's military training in an elite unit of the Israeli Army has equipped him with the focus and determination to complete his mission, as demonstrated by his efforts to turn himself into the Churchill of the 21st century.\n\nNetanyahu's actions in 2009-10, including maneuvering the Iranian nuclear threat to the top of the international community's agenda, investing resources in an Israeli military option against Iran, and diplomatically leveraging this military option, have been significant in shaping the international community's policy towards Iran. The extent to which Netanyahu seriously considered attacking Iran or was merely playing strategic poker remains unclear. However, it is clear that, up to a point, Netanyahu has succeeded in standing up to a totalitarian rival and enlisting the help of the American superpower, as his hero, Winston Churchill, did.",
    " Title: Romney and Obama in Virtual Tie as Election Day Nears; Gender Dynamics Shift in Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nWith less than two weeks remaining before Election Day, the Associated Press-GfK poll shows a tight presidential race between Republican Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama. The poll indicates that Romney is favored by 47 percent of likely voters, while Obama receives 45 percent support, a result within the poll's margin of sampling error.\n\nThe poll reveals a significant shift in the gender dynamics of the race. Romney has erased Obama's 16-point advantage among women, with both candidates now receiving 47 percent support from women. Meanwhile, Obama has largely eliminated Romney's edge among men, with the former president's support among men at 45 percent, compared to Romney's 47 percent.\n\nRomney's improved standing among American voters is attributed to his strong performance in the first debate and increased confidence in his ability to handle the economy and understand the problems of the average voter. At the same time, expectations that Obama will be re-elected have slipped, with half of voters now expecting the president to win a second term, down from 55 percent a month earlier.\n\nHowever, Romney's standing in the election's final stretch will be crucial, as the race is still being decided in the handful of states whose electoral votes are still up for grabs. Polls in several battleground states still appear to favor Obama.\n\nRecently, Romney has been attempting to court female voters by downplaying social issues and projecting a more moderate stance on matters such as abortion. The AP-GfK poll shows that Romney is now even with Obama among women on women's issues, after trailing by 16 points a month earlier.\n\nHowever, the campaign is facing fallout from a comment by a Romney-endorsed Senate candidate in Indiana, who said that pregnancy from rape is \"something God intended.\" Romney quickly distanced himself from the remark, but Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the incident was \"a reminder that a Republican Congress working with a Republican President Mitt Romney would feel that women should not be able to make choices about their own health care.\"\n\nAmong female likely voters, 55 percent say Obama would make the right decisions on women's issues, compared with 41 percent who think Romney would. Romney's pitch to women has been focused on the economy, making the case that what women want most is to ensure their families and their country are on a solid financial footing. The poll shows that message appears to be taking root.\n\nA month ago, women favored Obama over Romney on the economy by 56 percent to 40 percent. Now, the split has shifted to 49 percent for Romney and 45 percent for Obama. Similarly, Obama's lead among women as the candidate who better understands the people's problems has narrowed considerably, from a 58-36 Obama advantage last month to a 50-43 Obama edge now.\n\nObama has been working to shore up his support among men, who tend to be more Republican than women. In the 2008 election, men broke 49 percent for Obama to 48 percent for John McCain, even though Obama got 53 percent of the vote overall. The president's job approval ratings among men have tended to fall below his ratings among women throughout his first term.\n\nA month ago, Romney's advantage among men was 13 percentage points. Now, it's down to 5 points, with most of the shift toward Obama coming among unmarried men. Obama's election chances hinge on turning out voters like Jon Gerton, a disabled construction worker from Jonesboro, Ark., who is a staunch Obama supporter but did not vote in 2008.\n\nOverall, people are significantly more optimistic about the economy and unemployment in the coming year than they have been at any point in AP-GfK polling going back to March 2011, when the poll first started asking those questions. And likely voters are even more optimistic than other adults. Nearly six in ten likely voters think the economy will improve in the next year, up from 46 percent last month. And 42 percent think the number of unemployed Americans will drop in the next year, up from 32 percent in September.",
    " Title: Enthusiasm Gap Favors Clinton in Ohio Early Voting, According to Twitter and Polls\n\nArticle:\n\nA significant enthusiasm gap appears to favor Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over her Republican counterpart, Donald Trump, in Ohio's early voting, according to data from Twitter and recent polls. The hashtag #OHVotesEarly, which started trending on Twitter as early voting began in Ohio, has shown a substantial disparity in mentions of the two candidates.\n\nTwitter data indicates that of the tweets sent using the hashtag #OHVotesEarly over the last 24 hours, 75 percent included mentions of Clinton, while just 25 percent mentioned Trump. This disparity is attributed to various factors, including the Clinton supporter who originally tweeted the hashtag on October 2, the Clinton campaign's widespread promotion of the hashtag, and the Trump campaign's error in announcing an incorrect start date for early voting.\n\nRecent polls also suggest a shift in favor of Clinton in Ohio. A new poll by Baldwin Wallace University Community Research Institute, conducted after Sunday's debate, shows Clinton leading Trump by 9 percentage points in a four-way race and by 11 percentage points in a head-to-head race. This marks a significant change from polls conducted a month ago, which showed Trump with a lead in Ohio.\n\nThe Trump campaign, however, maintains its optimism, stating that they will utilize every day of early and absentee voting to secure votes for Trump. Bob Paduchik, Trump's Ohio state director, said in a statement, \"Our campaign will be using every day of early and absentee voting to get out our voters, culminating in an Election Day win for Mr. Trump.\"\n\nEarly voting returns in other states also show a slight advantage for Clinton. According to a new report by NBC News and the voter data firm TargetSmart, Clinton has received more votes during the early voting period in Iowa, Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Carolina, while Trump is leading in Georgia and Florida.\n\nClinton campaign manager Robby Mook expressed optimism about these results, noting increased vote by mail requests among key demographics in Florida and high absentee ballot requests in Ohio. Mook also suggested that Nevada, North Carolina, and Florida could be decided before Election Day.\n\nRegardless of the early voting trends, the Clinton campaign may face a challenging task in convincing skeptical Trump supporters, and Trump himself, that the election results are legitimate, should Clinton emerge victorious.",
    " Title: Trump Doubles Obama's 2012 Vote Total in New Hampshire Primary\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump secured more than 120,000 votes in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, more than doubling former President Barack Obama's 2012 vote total in the state. With 87 percent of precincts reporting, Trump's vote count surpassed Obama's 49,080 total votes in 2012. The gap between the two presidents is expected to widen as more precincts report their totals Wednesday.\n\nTrump's vote count dwarfs the totals of other incumbent presidents. Then-President George W. Bush received 53,962 votes in the largely uncontested GOP primary in New Hampshire in 2004. In 1996, incumbent President Bill Clinton received 76,797 votes in New Hampshire's primary.\n\nThe high turnout for Trump in New Hampshire is a result of a coordinated effort by the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign to drive up turnout for the president. Trump himself rallied his supporters at a packed and fiery rally in Manchester, N.H., on Monday, the eve of the state's primary.\n\nIn the line to get into Trump's Monday rally, many of his voters seemed to have an uncommon zeal for supporters of an incumbent president. Jay McDonald of North Providence, R.I., said he \"100 percent\" supported Trump four years ago and \"nothing's changed.\" McDonald said he's \"maybe more angry that they could do that [impeachment] to a president and get away with it over nothing.\"\n\nDemocrats largely owned the turnout in New Hampshire Tuesday, with first and second place finishers Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg combining for almost 140,000 votes with 87 percent reporting. The Democratic primary is still wide open, and there was almost nothing at stake for Trump in the New Hampshire race. His only primary challenger on the ballot was former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who had less than 10 percent of the GOP vote with 87 percent in.\n\nThe Trump campaign also touted a record turnout for an incumbent in the Iowa caucuses, which came on the same night that Democratic turnout fell well below expectations. About 176,000 Iowa Democrats attended their precinct caucuses, a slight uptick from 2016 but fewer than expected. That total is nowhere near the party's 2008 numbers, when roughly 238,000 Iowans participated in the kickoff clash among Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, onetime Iowa favorite John Edwards, and a handful of others.",

Justin Amash Forms Exploratory Committee for Presidential Run as Libertarian Candidate\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Justin Amash, a five-term incumbent from Michigan and former co-founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, has formed an exploratory committee for a potential presidential run under the Libertarian Party (L.P.). The 40-year-old congressman, who is the son of Middle Eastern immigrants, aims to become the first high-profile presidential candidate and the most prominent L.P. standard-bearer in the party's half-century of existence.\n\nAmash, who is known for his advocacy of limited government, has been touted as the heir apparent to former Representative Ron Paul on Capitol Hill. He has described himself as \"the only libertarian member of Congress\" and has led congressional efforts to dismantle the surveillance state, restore legislative-branch responsibility, and oppose federal overreach.\n\nHowever, Amash's lack of active engagement with the L.P. and its events has drawn criticism from some within the party. Future of Freedom Foundation founder Jacob Hornberger, a prominent L.P. figure, has been critical of Amash's interest in the party's presidential nomination, citing the congressman's lack of attendance at L.P. conventions and debates.\n\nIn the only 2020 three-way poll conducted thus far, Morning Consult found that just 1% of 1,992 registered voters would vote for Amash over Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Two national polls in 2019 had Amash averaging 5.5%. The potential impact of Amash on the presidential swing state of Michigan is a matter of interest for both major parties, though a highly polarized political climate following a close presidential election tends to be unfavorable for minor candidates.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Amash will officially withdraw from his reelection campaign, as he cannot seek both offices come November. The L.P. is scheduled to select its nominee in late May, but the physical and legal status of the national convention is in coronavirus limbo, and the event's Austin hotel has been canceled. The L.P. National Committee may reschedule the convention, providing Amash with additional time to convince wary delegates.",
    " Title: U.S. Surpasses 100,000 COVID-19 Deaths, Leads World in Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has surpassed 100,000 deaths from COVID-19, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. This makes the U.S. the country with the most confirmed deaths from the virus. As of 6 p.m. Eastern Time on May 27, the death toll stands at 100,047.\n\nThis number is equivalent to the entire population of mid-sized cities like Albany, N.Y., or Boca Raton, Fla. It surpasses the number of American lives lost during the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks combined.\n\nInitially, White House officials projected that between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans could die from COVID-19, even with preventive measures like social distancing. Independent researchers have often produced even higher estimates. On May 26, a Harvard health policy expert told NPR that the U.S. could see an additional 100,000 COVID-19 deaths this summer alone.\n\nDaily U.S. coronavirus cases and deaths have declined substantially since a peak in April, including in many of the country's hardest-hit areas, like New York City. However, experts have warned that rural areas may not have seen the worst of COVID-19 yet. During the week ending May 26, about 7,000 people in the U.S. died from COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 tracker.\n\nThe U.S. leads the world in coronavirus cases, with nearly 1.7 million cases reported as of 6 PM Eastern Time on May 27, according to Johns Hopkins data. This number is likely an underestimate due to inadequate testing capacity and the number of people who develop mild illnesses and do not seek medical attention.\n\nNew diagnoses are starting to decrease, but the trend seems to have reversed itself in recent days. This may be due to the country's commitment to social distancing appearing to falter as states reopen and summer weather draws people out of their homes.\n\nA top World Health Organization official warned on May 26 that \"we're right in the middle of the first wave [of coronavirus cases] globally\" and said \"we're still very much in a phase where the disease is actually on the way up\" in many parts of the world.\n\nExperts do not know when COVID-19 cases and deaths will level off for good, but they do know that, in the absence of a vaccine that can provide widespread immunity, social distancing is among the best\u2014and only\u2014ways to keep infection, hospitalization, and death rates as low as possible. A Columbia University analysis published May 20 estimated that 36,000 lives could have been saved if the U.S. broadly adopted social-distancing policies a week earlier than many places did, in mid-March.\n\nThe 100,000 lives already lost in the U.S. serve as a painful reminder of what happened instead.",
    " Title: Obama Faces Significant Hurdles in Pursuit of Grand Bargain Amidst Tax Increase Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama is facing substantial, and possibly insurmountable, obstacles in reviving a grand bargain, with the most significant hurdle being his decision to implement a $600 billion tax increase in December. At the time, Obama claimed victory by imposing new taxes on the wealthy while preserving George W. Bush's tax cuts for other individuals. However, this victory now appears more like a missed opportunity than a political or policy triumph.\n\nInstead, it seems likely that the $600 billion in tax increases will represent the extent of new revenue Obama can secure. This is significantly less than the $1.6 trillion he aims for, or even the $1 trillion-plus that was discussed in previous grand bargain negotiations.\n\nObama initially believed he could pressure Republicans into doubling the size of his tax increase to avoid severe defense cuts due to the sequester. However, he was mistaken. Once Republicans accepted the $600 billion in tax hikes, they made it clear they were no longer open to further tax increases for the current Congress. According to Republicans, they are indeed done raising taxes.\n\nThe primary reason top Democrats and Republicans dismiss the possibility of a grand bargain this time around is the strained relationship between Obama and Republicans on Capitol Hill. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), the third-ranking House Republican, shared an anecdote of an exchange he had with Obama at Saturday night's white-tie Gridiron dinner. During a break in the program, McCarthy approached Obama, who was reading his BlackBerry.\n\nAccording to McCarthy, Obama responded to McCarthy's jest about waiting for a dinner invitation by referring to House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan and stating, \"You guys give us too much credit. We\u2019re not doing all that stuff you think we are.\" As McCarthy walked away, he thought: \"He\u2019s still a law professor. He\u2019d rather lecture you and put a red mark on your paper than talk to you.\"\n\nAnother reason for the diminished prospects of a grand bargain is the rancid relationship between Obama and Republicans on Capitol Hill. A senior Democratic leadership aide stated, \"Nobody is even talking about a grand bargain. It is not even on our radar right now.\" An adviser to Speaker John Boehner echoed this sentiment, stating that the window for a grand bargain was closed by Obama's hardball tactics since the tax hike.",
    " Title: Newly Released Text Messages Suggest FBI Officials Knew No Charges Would Be Filed Against Hillary Clinton Before Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department has provided nearly 400 pages of additional text messages between two FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who were removed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. The messages, which were released to congressional committees on Friday, reportedly indicate that Strzok and Page knew that charges would not be filed against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as a result of the investigation into her email server before Clinton was interviewed by the bureau.\n\nStrzok, an FBI counterintelligence agent, and Page were pulled off the probe last summer after it emerged that some of their messages to each other included anti-Trump content. Strzok was reassigned to the Bureau's human resources division after the discovery of the exchanges with Page, with whom he was having an affair.\n\nAccording to a Saturday letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray from Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, the Justice Department provided 384 pages of messages to lawmakers on Friday. However, Johnson noted that additional texts sent between Dec. 14, 2016, and May 17 of last year were not preserved by the FBI's system.\n\nOne exchange between Strzok and Page, dated July 1, 2016, referenced then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch's decision to accept the FBI's conclusion in the Clinton investigation. Lynch's announcement came days after it was revealed that the attorney general and former President Bill Clinton had an impromptu meeting aboard her plane in Phoenix.\n\n\"Yeah, that is awful timing,\" Page agreed in the message. In a later message, she added, \"It's a real profile in courage, since she knows no charges will be brought.\"\n\nFour days later, then-FBI Director James Comey announced that no charges would be brought against Clinton, even though -- as he put it -- her actions in regard to the private server were \"extremely careless.\"\n\nAnother exchange from the day before referenced a change to Comey's statement closing out the investigation. While an earlier draft of the statement said Clinton and President Barack Obama had an email exchange while Clinton was \"on the territory\" of a hostile adversary, the reference to Obama at first was changed to \"senior government official\" and then omitted entirely in the final version.\n\nLast month, the Justice Department released hundreds of text messages that the two had traded before becoming part of the Mueller investigation. Many focused on their observations of the 2016 election and included discussions of the Clinton investigation. Republican lawmakers have contended the communication reveals the FBI and the Mueller team to be politically tainted and biased against Trump -- assertions Wray has flatly rejected.\n\nIn Johnson's letter to Wray, he asked whether the FBI had any records of communications between Strzok and Page during that five-month window and whether the FBI had searched their non-FBI phones for additional messages. He also asks for the \"scope and scale\" of any other records from the Clinton investigation that have been lost.\n\nA source on the committees receiving the texts told Fox News it was \"outrageous\" that the FBI had not previously indicated that the five-month gap in the messages existed. The source said it was incumbent on the FBI to prove that the missing texts do not constitute \"obstruction\" of congressional oversight or \"destruction of evidence.\"\n\nThe source added that congressional investigators want to know if the Justice Department's inspector general has copies of the messages.",
    " Title: Investigative Journalist Sharyl Attkisson Exposes \"Smear Machine\" in Political Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn her latest book, \"The Smear: How Shady Political Operatives and Fake News Control What You See, What You Think, and How You Vote,\" investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson discusses the manipulation of public perception through a hidden agenda. In a recent interview with Jenna Browder of \u2588\u2588\u2588, Attkisson explained the existence of an industry that targets journalists, whistleblowers, and political figures to smear their reputation.\n\n\"There is an industry that is paid to go after and target journalists, whistleblowers, political figures, whatever it may be, and inundate our consciousness and the images we see to try to ruin, destroy, or smear the idea that they don't like or the person who's delivering it on behalf of paid corporate or political interests,\" Attkisson said.\n\nAttkisson further elaborated on the concept, quoting a smear artist who stated, \"Everything you see is put there for a reason.\" She explained that the images and narratives people encounter, whether it's on social media, television, or in the news, are often placed there by someone who paid a lot of money to do so.\n\nThe 2016 election, according to Attkisson, serves as a prime example of this \"smear machine\" operating at full speed. \"There was the idea in the past that conservatives had the edge, but for 2016, going into that race, all seem to agree that Democrats had control of the messaging, particularly when it came to using the news media,\" she said.\n\nIn her book, Attkisson uses statistics from Freedom of Information Act requests and information exposed by outlets like WikiLeaks to illustrate the influence of these groups on the narrative. \"These groups say how they were able to influence the narrative. They name names. They talk about the news publications and networks that publish the stories they wanted them to publish. I've even published emails between journalists and these interests that they're supposed to cover, showing what I call transactional journalism, which I think is ethically inappropriate when they're making deals with the news makers,\" she said.\n\nDespite Democrats' alleged control of the messaging, Republicans ultimately won the election. Attkisson attributes this to voters becoming more media-savvy. \"Are people getting wise to these techniques? Are they seeing through some of the narratives? I think it's fair to say that 90 percent of the news narrative was in one direction, and yet Donald Trump still managed to overcome what this huge machine had built against him,\" she said.\n\nRegarding the Russia probe, Attkisson stated, \"President Trump is correct when he says that this is a 'witch hunt' in some respect based on the evidence to date and based on Obama's own intel experts who not only didn't see any evidence of collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians by their own account, but also by the account of all public information, Democrats and Republicans alike, who haven't seen the connection and yet, you've seen it dominate the news narrative.\"\n\nAttkisson further criticized the coverage of the Russia probe, stating that it is disproportionate to the evidence at large. \"I call it like the Brady Bunch, 'Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.' You just hear, 'Russia, Russia, Russia' all the time, and there have been wildly incorrect reports from some formerly top-respected news outlets in the nation about all of this, and in some cases, they haven't even corrected or done mea culpas when what they report has been found to be false,\" she said.\n\nAttkisson concluded by emphasizing the importance of questioning nearly everything one sees or reads, approaching it with a healthy dose of skepticism. \"Nearly every image that's put before them, in the words of the people who operate in this universe, is put before them for a reason by an interest that is often not disclosed. That should make you question when you see themes and memes coming up on social media and common ideas expressed over and over again. That should make you question, who's behind it? Who wants me to think this way?\"",
    " Title: Quinnipiac University Poll Shows President Obama Leading in Three Key Battleground States\n\nArticle:\n\nAccording to a new poll conducted by Quinnipiac University, former President Barack Obama is leading his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, in three key battleground states. The poll, which was jointly conducted with The New York Times and CBS, shows Obama with a significant lead in Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Florida, Obama holds a six-point lead with 51% of likely voters favoring him, compared to 45% who lean toward Romney. In Ohio, the lead is five points, with Obama at 50% and Romney at 44%. In Pennsylvania, Obama's lead is even more substantial, with 53% of likely voters supporting him, compared to 42% for Romney.\n\nThe poll also indicates that Obama is viewed more positively by voters in each state, with at least 50% holding a favorable opinion of him. Romney, on the other hand, was underwater on favorability in all three states, performing the worst in Pennsylvania, where only 39% of voters hold a favorable view of the former Massachusetts governor, compared to 47% with an unfavorable view.\n\nThe poll suggests that voters supporting Romney in all three states are more likely to back him because they dislike Obama, rather than vice versa. In Florida, for example, nearly two-thirds of Obama's supporters say they strongly favor their candidate, compared to 14% who support him because they dislike Romney. In contrast, 49% of Romney's backers strongly favor him, with 19% supporting him because they dislike Obama.\n\nThe poll was conducted from July 24 through July 30 among 1,193 likely voters in Ohio, 1,168 likely voters in Florida, and 1,168 likely voters in Pennsylvania. The sample size of Democrats was greater in the poll, with 36% of Florida voters identifying as Democrats, compared to 27% Republicans and 32% independents. The split was nearly identical in Ohio, with 35% saying they were Democrats, 27% Republicans, and 32% independents. In Pennsylvania, 38% considered themselves Democrats, 32% Republicans, and 26% independents.\n\nVoters were also evenly split on which candidate would do a better job on the economy, the most important issue for voters in all three states. However, they strongly support Obama's plan to raise taxes on households making more than $250,000 to reduce the federal deficit, with 62% of Pennsylvania voters, 60% in Ohio, and 58% in Florida supporting the plan.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 157,000 Jobs in July; Unemployment Rate Dips to 3.9 Percent\n\nThe U.S. economy continued to add jobs at a steady pace in July, with the unemployment rate remaining low. The Labor Department reported a lower-than-expected job growth of 157,000 and an unemployment rate of 3.9 percent, as projected.\n\nPayrolls were revised upward by 59,000 for the prior two months. They grew 248,000 in June, up from the previously reported 213,000, and 268,000 in May, compared with the 244,000 last reported. Over the prior 12 months, payrolls have been growing an average of 203,000 per month.\n\nManufacturing jobs grew by 37,000 in July, jobs in professional and business services were up 51,000, and leisure and hospitality jobs rose 40,000.\n\nAnalysts had estimated that about 190,000 jobs were added in July, and they had expected the unemployment rate to inch down to 3.9 percent from June's 4 percent. Before this year, the last time the jobless rate was this low was in 2000.\n\nIn July, average hourly earnings increased by 7 cents, to $27.05. That level is up 2.7 percent over the prior year, the same as June's pace. With the economy at full employment and hiring managers struggling to fill open positions, wages normally would be expected to start rising at a faster rate. However, wages are increasing at a 2.7 percent annual rate, which is lower than some economists' expectations of about 3.5 percent.\n\nThe economy picked up dramatically in the second quarter, with a 4.1 percent pace\u2014lifted by jumps in consumer spending and exports\u2014being the strongest in nearly four years. Some economists attributed these factors to temporary factors, such as the Republican tax cuts and increased export shipments ahead of retaliatory tariffs by China on U.S. agricultural products.\n\nPresident Trump called the numbers \"very sustainable,\" adding, \"This is not a one-time shot...Next quarter, I think it's going to be outstanding.\" The Federal Reserve noted that the labor market has \"continued to strengthen\" and that the economy overall has also been strong. It decided to keep interest rates unchanged but has signaled that it will hike them twice more this year.",
    " Title: Post-Election Republican Response to Immigration and Latino Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 presidential election, Republican elites advocated for an amnesty policy for illegal immigrants, a move that nearly caused a rift within the party, according to a piece by Rich Lowry. The article, titled \"The amnesty fantasy,\" suggests that the post-election Republican reaction was driven by panic, wishful thinking, and ethnic pandering.\n\nJohn McCain, who supported comprehensive immigration reform, nearly alienated himself within the Republican Party with his stance on amnesty. Despite this, McCain managed to secure 4 percentage points more support among Latino voters in 2008 than Mitt Romney did in 2012, according to exit polls.\n\nThe article questions the assumption that amnesty is the key to winning over the Latino vote. It argues that the common thread uniting McCain and Romney, both Republicans, is their support for conservative economic policies, rather than their positions on immigration.\n\nThe article also highlights demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Among native-born Hispanics, 50 percent of households with children are headed by unmarried mothers, and about 40 percent of all households receive benefits from a major welfare program. The article suggests that these statistics indicate that these households may not be natural Republican voters.\n\nFurthermore, the article points out that Latinos tend to have liberal attitudes toward government, with 61 percent of Latinos supporting the preservation of Obamacare and 66 percent believing the government should ensure access to health insurance. This could be attributed to the fact that 32 percent of nonelderly Latinos lack health insurance, about twice the national average.",
    " Title: Defense Secretary James Mattis Resigns, Cites Policy Differences with President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis has resigned, citing policy differences with President Donald Trump in a letter released on Thursday. Mattis, a retired four-star general, had been considered one of the president's most critical cabinet members due to his role as a strong check against Trump's national security impulses.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mattis reiterated his belief in America's alliances and partnerships, particularly NATO, and the need for the U.S. to be \"resolute and unambiguous\" in challenging countries such as China and Russia. He wrote, \"We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity, and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.\"\n\nPresident Trump announced Mattis' departure as a retirement, tweeting that Mattis would be stepping down at the end of February. Trump credited Mattis with helping his administration with the \"purchase of new fighting equipment\" and helping other countries pay their military obligations. Trump added that he would name a new secretary of defense shortly.\n\nMattis' resignation comes a day after Trump made the abrupt decision to withdraw 2,000 troops from Syria. The tone of Mattis' resignation letter clashed with Trump's own announcement, which characterized Mattis' decision to quit as a retirement.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Mattis had a mixed record of success with Trump. He opposed pulling out of the Iran deal, moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, creating a Space Force, and starting a trade war with America's allies. However, he failed to persuade Trump to see things his way on each of those issues, despite his good rapport with the president.\n\nMattis' departure leaves National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to face less resistance as they offer more hawkish advice on North Korea, Iran, and more. Mattis had a few notable successes, such as stopping Trump from ordering the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and ensuring the Trump administration stuck to a diplomatic approach with North Korea rather than a military one. However, he also made questionable decisions, such as recommending an attack on terrorists in Yemen that led to the death of a Navy SEAL and avoiding speaking on camera to the press and curtailing media access to the Pentagon.\n\nWith Mattis gone, there are concerns that Trump is left with few if any moderating influences on his national security team. Mattis, along with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, were frequently labeled as some of the few \"adults\" in the room whose military and strategic expertise would help them gain Trump's trust and moderate the president's most dangerous foreign policy impulses. However, like much in Trump's world, it didn't happen quite that way. Many still say they'll miss Mattis, and that U.S. foreign policy may be worse off without him.",
    " Title: Biden's Interview with Charlamagne tha God: A Testy Exchange or a Productive Dialogue?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with Charlamagne tha God, the popular African American radio host and former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, engaged in a conversation that has been described as a \"testy exchange.\" However, this characterization may not accurately represent the nature of the discussion.\n\nCharlamagne, known for his incisive questioning of politicians, pressed Biden on various issues, including the Democratic Party's relationship with black voters, Biden's support of the 1994 crime bill, the decriminalization of marijuana, and the push for a black woman as a running mate. The interview, which was taped on Thursday, was cut short twice due to scheduling conflicts, but Biden continued the conversation both times.\n\nDuring the interview, Biden addressed several policy proposals, including his defense of the good aspects of the 1994 crime bill and his plans for the future. Charlamagne, who has a significant following of 2.1 million Twitter followers, engaged Biden in a respectful and probing manner, allowing the interviewee to answer tough questions without being overly confrontational.\n\nThe interview ended with a light-hearted exchange, during which Biden jokingly stated, \"You got more questions, but I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\" This statement, made in the context of the previous 17 minutes and 21 seconds of the interview, is likely to be interpreted as a humorous comment, given Biden's long-standing relationship with the African American community and his service as Vice President to the nation's first black president.\n\nThe willfully ignorant might misinterpret Biden's statement as a challenge to one's blackness, similar to questioning someone's blackness for not having seen a particular movie. Instead, it appears to be an expression of exasperation, akin to saying, \"Where have you been?\" rather than \"You\u2019ve been voted off the island.\"\n\nThe interview concluded with an invitation for Biden to return to the Breakfast Club, where Charlamagne will continue to press him on various issues affecting the African American community, and Biden will have another opportunity to seek the support of black voters.",
    " Title: Mega-Donor Glass Ceiling: Women Largely Absent in Political Contributions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2012 election, Miriam Adelson, a physician and drug addiction expert, was the top female donor, contributing approximately $46 million, primarily to Republican committees and super PACs. This amount was more than twice the combined contributions of the next top 15 women donors. Her husband, Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, donated $50 million. However, Miriam Adelson did not receive the same attention as her husband, despite her significant contributions.\n\nWomen are making strides in various political spheres, but their campaign contributions lag significantly behind those of male donors. Reasons for this disparity include a relative lack of cash, distaste for the political process, and the decision to donate money elsewhere, according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 survey.\n\nThe lack of women megadonors has an impact on the political discourse, as it is wealthy men such as Charles and David Koch, Jeffrey Katzenberg, or Foster Friess who often have the clout. These individuals are the ones who are chased down by reporters, appear on cable TV, and whose ideas can drive the national conversation.\n\nSiobhan \u201cSam\u201d Bennett, president and CEO of the Women\u2019s Campaign Fund and a former Democratic congressional candidate, stated, \u201cIt would be naive to say that political giving doesn\u2019t influence what gets discussed and what gets talked about.\u201d Amber Mostyn, a Democratic megadonor and Houston trial lawyer, who donated $1.3 million to federal candidates and super PACs in the 2012 election, and thousands more to state-level candidates in Texas, said the lack of women donors \u201cabsolutely\u201d affects policy.\n\nThe discrepancy in political contributions is evident in the numbers. Of the top 100 overall donors, 11 were women, accounting for approximately 17% of the total amount given by those 100 donors, according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 review of Federal Election Commission reports and data from the Center for Responsive Politics. The disparity continues down the line, with women accounting for 28% of the top 31,000 donors, according to the Sunlight Foundation.\n\nThe numbers are based on contributions to campaigns, committees, and super PACs, and do not include contributions to 501(c)(4) nonprofits such as Americans for Prosperity that are not required to disclose donors. Although seven of the 400 richest self-made people in the United States are women, according to Forbes, and women hold far fewer high-level corporate jobs and board seats, donations from women to political causes, parties, and candidates have lagged behind men even when controlling for income.\n\nSusie Tomkins Buell, a Democratic megadonor associated with Democracy Alliance, an exclusive group of top liberal donors, stated, \u201cThe reason women don\u2019t give to politics is because they\u2019re lacking the mentorship and the support that men receive.\u201d Buell added, \u201cBut once they get invited in, they feel very empowered by the act.\u201d",

Epstein killed himself in his jail cell last summer while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\n\nGiuffre has said she had sex with Andrew three times, including once in London in 2001 at the home of Epstein's girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. It isn't clear what legal exposure Andrew might have in the case, if any. The age of consent for sex is 16 in England and 17 in New York. However, Giuffre claims that she was paid by Epstein for her sexual encounters with Andrew. That could constitute a violation of U.S. sex trafficking laws if she was under age 18 or was coerced into unwanted sex acts.\n\nAndrew, who is eighth in line for the British throne, and Maxwell have both denied any knowledge that Epstein was sexually abusing teenage girls. In a TV interview last fall, Andrew insisted he was out having pizza with his children on the night Giuffre says they were together in London.\n\nU.S. Attorney General William Barr has vowed to aggressively investigate and bring charges against anyone who may have helped Epstein.\n\nAndrew, in the statement he released in November announcing his intention to \"step back from public duties,\" said he regretted his \"ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\n\"Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required,\" he wrote.\n\nBerman made his remarks about the case during a joint appearance with members of Safe Horizon, a nonprofit victim services agency, to discuss a new New York law that made it easier for people to sue over childhood sexual abuse.\n\nHe wouldn't discuss the Epstein investigation in detail but reiterated that the case didn't end with his death.\n\n\"Jeffrey Epstein couldn't have done what he did without the assistance of others, and I can assure you that the investigation is moving forward,\" Berman said.\n\nNumerous women who said they were sexually abused by Epstein as teenagers have claimed in lawsuits and interviews that he got help recruiting young girls from both Maxwell and several assistants.\n\nGiuffre's lawyers have, for months, been calling on Andrew to agree to be interviewed both by investigators and by the lawyers helping the women with those civil lawsuits.\n\nTo date, the only people besides Epstein who were charged in connection with the scandal are two jail guards who were supposed to be monitoring Epstein the night he was found dead. Both have been charged with falsifying the jail's log books to indicate they were performing checks on prisoners, when they were actually sleeping or browsing the internet.",

This announcement comes after Vice President Joe Biden's presentation of potential gun control proposals on Thursday, which did not include an assault weapons ban.\n\nThe omission of an assault weapons ban in Biden's proposals led to speculation in news reports that the White House had abandoned the idea. However, White House spokesman Matt Lehrich stated, \"Those reports are false.\" Lehrich added, \"The President has been clear that Congress should reinstate the assault weapons ban, and avoiding this issue just because it's been politically difficult in the past is not an option.\"\n\nOver the past week, Vice President Biden has been meeting with various stakeholders in the gun control debate. On Thursday, he held discussions with the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other gun owners groups, as well as representatives from the film and television industry.\n\nAdministration officials note that Biden's comments on Thursday were aimed at \"consensus\" proposals emerging from the task force meetings. An assault weapons ban would not fit this category.\n\nIn a statement following their meeting with the vice president, the NRA expressed disappointment and accused the administration of pursuing an \"agenda to attack the Second Amendment.\"\n\nOrganizations advocating for tougher gun control laws argue that an assault weapons ban is crucial in addressing the nation's recent spate of mass shootings. However, implementing such a ban could face challenges in a gridlocked Congress.\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner stated it would be premature to comment on Vice President Biden's remarks. The Biden task force is expected to deliver its recommendations to the president on Tuesday. \"Once the President makes some recommendations, we'll take a look at them,\" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said.",
    " Title: Clinton and Kaine Criticize Trump's 100-Day Agenda, Emphasize Democratic Traditions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a campaign event on Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, criticized Republican rival Donald Trump's proposed first 100 days in office. The criticism centered on Trump's threat to sue women who have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on their campaign plane, Clinton and Kaine argued that Trump seemed more focused on settling personal grievances than on governing. Trump had earlier spoken at the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where he outlined his agenda for the first 100 days of his presidency and threatened to sue his accusers after the election.\n\nClinton stated, \"Our opponent, Donald Trump, went to Gettysburg, one of the most extraordinary places in American history, and basically said if he\u2019s president, he will spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior.\"\n\nIn contrast, Clinton and Kaine emphasized their focus on serving the American people if elected. \"Tim and I are going to keep talking about what we want to do if we\u2019re given the great honor of serving as president and vice president,\" Clinton said. \"We\u2019ll get to work the day after the election and do everything possible to be prepared on Jan. 20 to start doing the business of the American people.\"\n\nKaine added that Trump \"seemed most personally invested in...all of the scores that he needs to settle with people he\u2019s mad at.\"\n\nThe event followed a rally at a local high school in Pittsburgh, where Clinton touched on a theme she has emphasized in recent days: that Trump poses a threat to America's democratic traditions. Clinton has criticized Trump for suggesting he might not concede the election in the event of a defeat.\n\nClinton stated, \"Failing to accept election results, however disappointing, is the difference between 'leadership and dictatorship.'\" She added that Trump shows a troubling disregard for constitutional freedoms and protections.\n\nClinton also referred to Trump's contention that she should be jailed for using a private email system while she was secretary of state. \"Every time he says he wants to jail his opponent\u2014meaning me\u2014I think to myself, 'We don\u2019t do that in America. We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary,'\" she said.\n\nClinton also devoted time to the campaign of Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who is challenging incumbent Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey. Democrats believe McGinty's defeat is central to retaking control of the Senate and providing Clinton with a friendlier Congress should she win in November.\n\nIn devoting time to McGinty's campaign, Clinton demonstrated her focus on down-ballot races that would affect her policy agenda should she win on Nov. 8. \"Katie will help us break through the gridlock\u2014actually make a difference in people\u2019s lives,\" Clinton said.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Block Unanimous Vote on Additional Small Business Aid Amid Disagreements Over Coronavirus Relief Package\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats have blocked a Republican push to unanimously pass a bill to provide an additional $250 billion for a loan program aimed at small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The move came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) attempted to approve the measure by a unanimous vote, but was stalled by Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD), who objected to the request.\n\nOn the Senate floor, McConnell stated he was not \"talking about changing any policy language\" that was part of an unprecedented $2 trillion emergency spending package negotiated between the parties last month. He urged Democrats not to \"block emergency aid you do not even oppose just because you want something more\" \u2013 referring to proposed changes to the small business aid program and additional emergency funding for hospitals and states, a proposal Democratic leaders outlined on Wednesday.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) then attempted to unanimously pass a Democratic amendment, which McConnell blocked, leading to the Senate adjourning until Monday after a roughly 30-minute pro forma session. It is unclear if Republicans and Democrats will try to reach agreement on emergency legislation in the coming days.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has indicated she could try to pass a Democratic bill on Friday, which Republicans can likely block with most representatives out of Washington. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Pelosi called McConnell's move a \"stunt.\"\n\nPelosi also stated that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asked for a quarter of a trillion dollars in 48 hours without providing data to justify the need. Pelosi echoed Sen. Ben Cardin in calling McConnell's move a \"stunt.\"\n\nThe Kentucky Republican contended that the small business aid is the only part of the $2 trillion rescue law \"at risk of exhausting its funding right now.\" The Trump administration cited strong demand for the loans this week as it asked Congress for more money for the program, which is designed to help small businesses keep employees on payroll. Lawmakers initially approved $350 billion for loans, which can be forgiven partly or fully if companies use them on expenses such as payroll, rent, and utilities.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked for an emergency bill to include $250 billion for hospitals, health systems, state and local governments, and food assistance programs, in addition to money for small companies. However, Pelosi said she only wanted $125 billion for the existing program specifically, and another $125 billion for community-based lenders and SBA disaster assistance loans and grants.\n\nThe Democrats have expressed concerns about the small business loan program, citing reports of confusion around applications, loan terms, and eligibility. They also worry that the program may leave out rural business owners, farmers, and small firms who do not already work with a bank participating in the program. McConnell contends that Democrats do not need to attach other emergency funding measures to the small business plan.\n\n\"Nobody believes this is the Senate's last word on COVID-19. We do not have to do everything right now,\" McConnell said.",
    " Title: Ezra Klein's Book \"Why We're Polarized\" Explores American Polarization, Minimally Attributing Role to Technology\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a conversation with Nicholas Thompson, editor-at-large at Vox and host of The Ezra Klein Show podcast, Ezra Klein discusses his new book \"Why We're Polarized.\" The book, released during the impeachment hearings, delves into the historical context of American polarization, arguing that the country has become significantly more polarized over the past 50 years.\n\nThompson, who had read the book's galleys, praised its captivating exploration of American history and its persuasive argument that the country is more polarized now than in the past. When asked about the role of technology in the book, Klein clarified that while social media is a polarization accelerant, it plays a relatively small role in the overall story of American polarization, as the bulk of the increase in party polarization predates social media.\n\nKlein's core argument is that over the past 50 years, the country's dominant political coalitions have sorted themselves by ideology, race, religion, geography, psychology, consumer behavior, and cultural preferences. This sorting has triggered a series of feedback loops in which political institutions (media, Congress) and actors (candidates, individual journalists) adopt more polarized strategies to respond and appeal to a more polarized audience, which further polarizes the audience, the institutions, and so on.\n\nThompson expressed concerns about the role of the press in this feedback loop, citing the example of a newspaper that is relentlessly critical of a particular political figure, which may attract critics of that figure, leading to increased page views and incentivizing more of the same. Klein agreed with Thompson's assessment, acknowledging the two basic problems caused by this kind of polarization: a constant state of anger and agitation, and the inability of political institutions to function effectively due to the high levels of compromise required.\n\nKlein's primary concern is that the current level of polarization makes bipartisanship irrational for the out-of-power party to offer, as winning an election rarely grants the power to govern. In a polarized system, bipartisanship is necessary, but with parties as polarized as they are, bipartisanship is irrational for the out-of-power party to offer. This leaves the public trapped in a system where everyone is fighting, but their problems are not being resolved.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Launches Nationwide Campaign to Promote Health Care Enrollment\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's public appearances may suggest that he has retired from campaigning, but the White House is gearing up for a significant campaign this summer, aiming to cover all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The success or failure of this campaign could potentially shape Obama's legacy, as the Affordable Care Act, also known as \"Obamacare,\" faces a new challenge: convincing uninsured individuals to purchase health care when it becomes available on October 1.\n\nDuring his commencement address at Morehouse College this month, Obama urged graduates to sign up for health insurance in the fall. He emphasized the importance of universal health coverage, stating, \"We've got to make sure everybody has good health in this country. It's not just good for you, it's good for this country. So you're going to have to spread the word to your fellow young people.\"\n\nDavid Simas, deputy senior adviser to the president, oversees the implementation of universal health coverage from a windowless basement office in the West Wing. The administration aims to enroll 7 million people across the country in the first year, a goal that Simas says will require television ads, door-to-door canvassing, and extensive word-of-mouth efforts.\n\nThe administration is developing an Expedia-style website to make the enrollment process as user-friendly as possible. However, attracting people to this website is a significant challenge. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll from last month revealed that 4 in 10 Americans are unaware that the health care law is still in effect.\n\nNancy-Ann DeParle, who has worked on this issue for years, including as Obama's deputy chief of staff, is not concerned about this lack of awareness. She believes that people were not paying attention until now, as there is so much else happening that would have made a campaign two years ago ineffective.\n\nHowever, the administration's efforts have already faced obstacles. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has repeatedly requested funding from Congress to implement Obamacare, but Republicans have consistently refused, while voting to repeal the law. Without the requested funding, Sebelius attempted to fundraise for an independent group called Enroll America, which focuses on implementing Obamacare. This move has sparked controversy, with Republicans accusing Sebelius of bypassing Congress by soliciting private donations.\n\nTwo Republican-controlled House committees are now investigating these solicitations, which has reportedly made potential donors hesitant. If health care companies hold back, it could make it more difficult to reach the target audience in various communities.\n\nAnother crucial aspect of the campaign is ensuring that young and healthy individuals, who typically require less medical care, enroll in the system to balance out the financial structure. Administration officials are expected to deliver more commencement speeches this season, encouraging young graduates to sign up for health coverage in the fall.",
    " Title: House Republicans Resist Senate's Call for IRS Tax Enforcement Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Republicans, who have criticized the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for over a year, are now resisting calls to strengthen tax enforcement measures. They are opposing several Senate proposals aimed at addressing tax evasion, such as targeting doctors with back taxes, simplifying the process of verifying mortgage interest deductions, and reducing incorrect child tax credit claims.\n\nThis shift in stance represents a significant departure from a few years ago when Republicans supported efforts to enhance IRS's ability to clamp down on tax shelters and collaborate with foreign banks to identify undeclared American income abroad.\n\nThe change in attitude is attributed to a 2013 report by an inspector general that criticized the IRS for excessively scrutinizing tea party groups seeking tax-exempt status. Since then, over 20 congressional hearings have been held, leading to a lack of confidence in the IRS among both the public and Congress members.\n\nRepresentative Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio), a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, stated, \"There\u2019s not a whole lot of confidence right now about what the Internal Revenue Service does among the American people, let alone members of Congress. Why should we give them more tools to harass taxpayers?\"\n\nPolitical considerations also play a role in the resistance to tax enforcement measures. Cracking down on tax evasion could conflict with the House Republicans' campaign message this election year, according to Floyd Williams, the IRS's former director of legislative affairs.\n\nThe disagreement not only jeopardizes efforts to collect the estimated $400 billion in unpaid taxes annually, but it also threatens unrelated legislation. A highway budget bill containing several of the provisions is set to expire in the Senate this week due to House Republican opposition. Another Senate measure offering tax cuts to startup companies, small businesses, and certain industries is also at risk.\n\nThe position of House Republicans contrasts with that of Senate Republicans, who have traditionally been less zealous in their pursuit of the IRS. Senator John Thune (R-SD), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, stated, \"I don\u2019t think Senate Republicans on the [Finance] committee have a big problem with just making sure taxes that are owed are being collected. It\u2019s just a function of enforcing the law.\"\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) expressed concern that House Republicans are undermining a traditionally bipartisan cooperation on tax enforcement matters. \"This has been a traditional position supported by both sides of the aisle,\" he said. \"Certainly, this is a departure that needs to be addressed.\"\n\nBefore the tea party scandal, lawmakers had agreed to raise tens of billions of dollars by improving tax collections, often relying on third parties like banks and credit card companies to verify taxpayer declarations. This approach not only made it easier for the IRS to detect errors but also encouraged more accurate reporting due to the knowledge that someone else would also be reporting the information.",
    " Title: ISIS Claims Responsibility for Death of Aid Worker Peter Kassig, Releases Video\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Islamic State group has released a video on Sunday, allegedly showing the beheading of a dozen Syrian soldiers and claiming responsibility for the death of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. The video, posted on websites known to be used by ISIS, ends with a militant standing over a severed head he identifies as Kassig's. The White House confirmed Kassig's death on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe high-definition video shows the beheadings of about a dozen men identified as Syrian military officers and pilots, all dressed in blue jumpsuits. The video was filmed in Dabiq, a town in northern Syria that ISIS uses as the title of its English-language propaganda magazine and where they believe an apocalyptic battle between Muslims and their enemies will occur.\n\nThe main militant in the video who speaks to the camera has a British accent and warns that U.S. soldiers will meet a similar fate. \"We say to you, Obama,\" the militant said, \"... You claim to have withdrawn from Iraq four years ago, but here you are: You have not withdrawn. Rather, you hid some of your forces behind your proxies.\"\n\nA U.S.-led coalition is targeting the Islamic State group in airstrikes, supporting Western-backed Syrian rebels, Kurdish fighters, and the Iraqi military. The militant's voice is distorted in the video. Previous videos featured a militant with a British accent that the FBI says it has identified, though it has not named him publicly.\n\nLater in the video, the militant claims Kassig, 26, was killed because he \"fought against the Muslims in Iraq while serving as a soldier.\" Kassig, from Indianapolis, Indiana, served in the U.S. Army's 75th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit, and deployed to Iraq in 2007. After being medically discharged, Kassig formed the aid organization Special Emergency Response and Assistance (SERA) in Turkey to aid Syrian refugees. He delivered food and medical supplies and provided trauma care to wounded Syrian civilians before being captured in eastern Syria last year. Friends say he converted to Islam in captivity and took the first name Abdul-Rahman.\n\nBurhan Agha, a Syrian friend who worked with Kassig in Lebanon and who moved to Switzerland seeking asylum, wept when recounting his generosity. \"If I could apologize to each American, one by one, I would, because Peter died in Syria, while he was helping the Syrian people,\" Agha told the AP by telephone. \"Those who killed him claimed to have done it in the name of Islam. I am a Muslim and am from Syria.... (His killers) are not Muslims.\"\n\nThe White House said the U.S. intelligence community was examining the video. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said that if the video is authentic, the White House would be \"appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American.\" British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was \"horrified by the cold-blooded murder.\"\n\nThe Islamic State group has beheaded and shot dead hundreds of captives\u2014mainly Syrian and Iraqi soldiers\u2014during its sweep across the two countries, and has celebrated its mass killings in extremely graphic videos. The group has declared a self-styled Islamic caliphate in the areas under its control, which it governs according to its violent interpretation of Shariah law.\n\nOn Sunday, the Islamic State group claimed a bombing at the Baghdad International Airport that wounded five people, saying it was trying to strike Americans there. No one was wounded in a passing United Nations convoy, the organization said. The Islamic State group has its roots in al-Qaida's Iraqi affiliate but was expelled from the global terror network over its brutal tactics and refusal to obey orders to confine its activities to Iraq. It became even more extreme amid the bloody civil war in neighboring Syria and grew strong enough to launch a lightning offensive across Iraq. Syria's war began as an uprising against President Bashar Assad. Activists say that conflict has killed more than 200,000 people.",
    " Title: House Democrats Release Trove of Documents from Lev Parnas, Including Handwritten Note on Biden Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 House Democrats have released a trove of documents they obtained from Lev Parnas, a close associate of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, including a handwritten note that mentions asking Ukraine's president to investigate \"the Biden case.\"\n\nThe documents, obtained as part of the impeachment investigation, show Parnas communicating with Giuliani before the removal of Marie Yovanovitch, who was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. A man named Robert F. Hyde disparaged Yovanovitch in messages to Parnas and gave him updates on her location and cell phone use, raising questions about possible surveillance.\n\nDemocrats released the files Tuesday as they prepared to send articles of impeachment to the Senate for Trump's trial. The documents add new context to their charges that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Democrats as he withheld military aid.\n\nParnas was in frequent communication with Giuliani and with Ukrainian officials, the messages show. He appeared to be pushing unsubstantiated allegations that Democrat Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, were somehow engaged in corruption in Ukraine.\n\nAmong the documents is a screenshot of a previously undisclosed letter from Giuliani to Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskiy dated May 10, 2019, which was before Zelenskiy took office. In the letter, Giuliani requests a meeting with Zelenskiy \"as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent.\" In the letter, Giuliani said he would be accompanied at the meeting by Victoria Toensing, a Washington attorney and Trump ally.\n\nOne of the documents is a handwritten note on stationery from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Vienna that says \"get Zalensky to Annonce that the Biden case will be Investigated.\" Trump asked Zelenskiy in a July call to investigate his political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a gas company based in Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats said that Parnas' attorney confirmed that Parnas wrote the notes.\n\nThe documents \u2014 including phone records, texts, and flash drives turned over by Parnas \u2014 were sent to the House Judiciary Committee by three other House panels \"to be included as part of the official record that will be transmitted to the Senate along with the Articles of Impeachment,\" according to a statement. Some of the materials were made public while others were marked as sensitive.\n\nParnas and his business partner, Igor Fruman, both U.S. citizens who emigrated from the former Soviet bloc, were indicted last year on charges of conspiracy, making false statements, and falsification of records. Prosecutors allege they made outsize campaign donations to Republican causes after receiving millions of dollars originating from Russia. The men have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn several of the documents, Parnas communicated with Giuliani about the removal of Yovanovitch. The ambassador's ouster, ordered by Trump, was at the center of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry. Yovanovitch testified in the House impeachment hearings that she was the victim of a \"smear campaign.\"\n\nTrump, on a July 25 call, had promised Zelenskiy that Yovanovitch was \"going to go through some things.\" Roughly two months earlier, she was recalled from her diplomatic post.\n\nOn April 23, just before Yovanovitch was directed to return to the United States, Giuliani texted Parnas, \"He fired her again.\" Parnas texted back, \"I pray it happens this time I'll call you tomorrow, my brother.\"\n\nParnas also received messages from Hyde, who referred to Yovanovitch as a \"bitch.\" Hyde is now running for a U.S. House seat in Connecticut.\n\nAfter texting about the ambassador, Hyde gave Parnas detailed updates that suggested he was watching her. In one text, Hyde wrote: \"She's talked to three people. Her phone is off. Her computer is off.\" He said she was under heavy security and \"we have a person inside.\"\n\nHyde at one point texted Parnas that \"they are willing to help if we/you would like a price,\" and \"guess you can do anything in Ukraine with money... is what I was told.\"\n\nLawrence Robbins, an attorney for Yovanovitch, called for an investigation into the messages.\n\n\"Needless to say, the notion that American citizens and others were monitoring Ambassador Yovanovitch's movements for unknown purposes is disturbing,\" Robbins said. \"We trust that the appropriate authorities will conduct an investigation to determine what happened.\"\n\nOn Twitter, Hyde dismissed the claims as \"laughable\" and appeared to try to distance himself from Parnas. He said he would \"welcome\" an investigation.\n\nThe text messages show that Parnas consulted Giuliani in Jan. 2019 after the U.S. denied a visa for former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. Giuliani replied: \"I can revive it.\"\n\nThe following day, Giuliani told Parnas: \"It's going to work. I have no 1 in it.\" Giuliani then predicted \"he will get one\" before giving Parnas the phone number for Jay Sekulow, the leader of the president's personal legal team. Sekulow is expected to be part of Trump's legal team during the impeachment trial.\n\nA federal judge earlier this month ruled that Parnas could provide the materials to Congress as part of the impeachment proceedings.\n\nDemocrats voted in December to impeach Trump for abuse of power and for obstruction of Congress.",
    " Title: Romney Promises Opposite Approach to Obama on Israel, Faces Protests in Pennsylvania\n\nArticle:\n\nMitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has pledged to adopt an opposite approach to President Barack Obama on Israel during a speech to religious conservatives in Pennsylvania on Saturday. The speech, delivered via video uplink from his campaign bus, marked Romney's first extensive discussion of Israel since becoming the likely Republican nominee.\n\nRomney criticized Obama for appearing more concerned about Israel potentially attacking Iran than he is about Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. He stated, \"I think, by and large, you can just look at the things the president has done and do the opposite.\"\n\nThe speech was met with criticism from Democrats, who accused Romney of distorting Obama's record on Israel. Spokesman Ben LaBolt said Obama has provided Israel with more security assistance than any other administration and has stood with Israel at the United Nations.\n\nDuring the day, Romney's bus tour was disrupted by Democratic protests in Quakertown, Pennsylvania. The protests forced Romney to take a detour, leading him to visit a different Wawa store instead of the originally planned location.\n\nRomney's bus tour, which is his first traditional campaign swing since the primary, is aimed at undecided voters in six pivotal states won by Obama in 2008: New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa. The tour represents a new mode for Romney in the general election and will test him in less-scripted environments.\n\nIn addition to his speech on Israel, Romney also discussed economic issues during the tour, emphasizing the need for a \"very careful review\" of who is giving a fair shot to the American people. He made three appearances in small towns in Pennsylvania, including Quakertown, Cornwall, and the national historic landmark, Cornwall Iron Furnace.\n\nRomney also took time to engage with the local culture, learning the Pennsylvania term for submarine sandwiches\u2014hoagies\u2014and noting the intra-state rivalry between Wawa and Sheetz, two popular convenience stores in the state. However, his efforts to connect with the crowd in Cornwall were met with mixed reactions, as the town is near the state's geographic center, and the crowd was split on their preference for Wawa or Sheetz.",
    " Title: Chicago Mayor and Ivanka Trump Disagree on Interpretation of Chicago's Weekend Violence Incidents\n\nArticle:\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Presidential adviser Ivanka Trump have engaged in a public disagreement over the interpretation of gun violence incidents in Chicago. In response to the back-to-back mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, Ms. Trump tweeted about the violence in Chicago, stating, \"As we grieve over the evil mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, let us not overlook that Chicago experienced its deadliest weekend of the year, with 7 dead and 52 wounded near a playground in the Windy City.\"\n\nMayor Lightfoot, in a statement to reporters on Tuesday, rebuked Ms. Trump's tweets, stating they were \"misleading.\" According to the Chicago Tribune, Lightfoot clarified that the incidents did not occur near a playground, and the number of fatalities and wounded were not as high as suggested in the tweet.\n\nMayor Lightfoot emphasized the importance of accuracy when discussing such sensitive matters and focused on her efforts to keep the city safe. \"I'm not going to be distracted by nonsense tweets from people who don't know what they're talking about,\" she said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ms. Trump issued a statement reiterating that Chicago had experienced \"one of the deadliest weekends\" this year and that the first daughter's \"point remains the same\" about inner-city violence. The statement also acknowledged that the shooting incidents did not occur in one location, as the tweet might have suggested.\n\nMayor Lightfoot and Ms. Trump previously met in May in Washington, where they discussed workforce development and criminal justice reform, according to the Chicago Tribune.",
    " Title: Analogies Drawn Between Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore and George Wallace\n\nArticle:\n\nHistory professor Gordon Harvey at Jacksonville State University in Alabama has noted similarities in the political strategies of Roy Moore, a Republican Senate candidate, and George Wallace, a former Alabama governor known for his staunch segregationist views.\n\nMoore, like Wallace, has been involved in controversial political moments. In a campaign mailer, Moore sent out a statement that read, \"Think if a black man went after high school girls, anyone would try to make him a senator?\" This statement, while not as incendiary as some of Wallace's remarks, has sparked discussions about the campaign's racial politics.\n\nGeorge Wallace, a Democrat, is often referenced in contemporary Alabama politics due to his significant impact on the state's political landscape. Wallace was a boxer, a circuit judge with ambitious political aspirations, a state leader who defied federal authority, a symbol of defiance against the national cultural direction, a hero to many rural and small-town whites, and a politician who ran national campaigns on a promise to \"send them a message.\" These descriptions align well with Moore's political career.\n\nWallace's successful 1970 run for governor is often cited as an analogous race. He took on an \"unholy coalition\" of the Republican and Democratic national parties, militant blacks, and country club millionaires, as described by a national newspaper column. This coalition, with the exception of the White House, is similar to the groups Moore has faced in his political career, following President Trump's endorsement of his candidacy.\n\nHowever, those who knew Wallace well are quick to point out that the messengers are not alike. Despite the similarities in their messages, the context, intent, and political affiliations of the two individuals are significantly different.",
    " Title: Obama Dismisses Criticism of Syria Response, Cites Substance Over Style\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday, President Barack Obama dismissed criticism of his handling of the Syria crisis, stating that Washington often prioritizes style over substance.\n\n\"Folks here in Washington like to grade on style,\" Obama said. \"Had we rolled out something that was very smooth and disciplined and linear, they would have graded it well, even if it was a disastrous policy.... We know that because that's exactly how they graded the Iraq War until it ended up blowing [up] in our face.\"\n\nThe president has faced criticism since last summer when he stated that Syrian President Bashar Assad would \"cross a red line\" if chemical weapons were used in Syria's ongoing civil war. The criticism intensified last month when Obama suggested the United States should launch a military strike against Assad for using sarin gas in an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack that killed nearly 1,500 Syrians, but first wanted congressional approval.\n\nHowever, Congress, the American public, and other world leaders showed little interest in a military strike, which led to potential diplomatic solutions, the origins of which remain unclear.\n\nSome of the sharpest criticism has come from Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"It's like watching a caged dog,\" Corker said recently. \"Words like ad-hoc, improvised, unsteady come to mind.\"\n\nObama, now in his second term, acknowledged he is used to such criticism. \"I'm less concerned about style points. I'm much more concerned about getting the policy right,\" he said in a wide-ranging interview in which he also talked about Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon and criticized House Republicans' approach to fiscal negotiations, including an upcoming talk on increasing the federal debt limit.\n\nObama said the United States' approach to Syria should show Iran that there's the potential for diplomatic solutions to arms standoffs. However, he also said Iran should not assume that his preference for diplomacy means the U.S. won't strike Tehran.\n\nObama said Iranians understand that their pursuit of a nuclear weapon is \"a far larger issue for us\" than the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The president also said he has exchanged letters with Iran's new president, but the two have not spoken directly. Obama said he believes Iranian President Hasan Rouhani understands the potential for a diplomatic solution to his country's disputed nuclear program but will not \"suddenly make it easy.\"",
    " Title: New Yorkers Adapt to COVID-19 Etiquette: A Guide to Courteous Living During the Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nNew York City, known for its fast-paced lifestyle and often brusque inhabitants, is facing a new set of social norms during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As residents navigate the city's uncharted territory, they are learning to adapt and be more considerate of each other to make quarantine life more bearable.\n\nThe New York Post spoke with therapists, professional shoppers, and other experts to compile a guide to courteous living during the pandemic.\n\nGrocery shopping, for instance, requires new etiquette. If your grocery store hasn't mandated that only one person from your party enters the store, follow suit, advises Tim Hickey, an Instacart shopper from Staten Island. This helps essential workers maintain a safe distance at work.\n\nWearing a mask, even though it may be uncomfortable, is also crucial, Hickey adds. If you're getting your groceries delivered, consider the items you've selected. Heavy items like cases of water bottles or large bags of rice from Costco are hard to carry, making professional shoppers less likely to select your order, says Hickey.\n\nDelivery people prefer no-contact deliveries. Don't expect your groceries to be brought into your home. If you'd like them left in a certain area, note that in the app or contact your driver. \"I don't want to hand food to you. It's best if you stay inside your house when I'm delivering anything,\" says Hickey.\n\nTipping within the app is best right now, says Hickey, who also drives for DoorDash and Uber Eats. Most of his customers have been tipping him more than 20 percent, he adds.\n\nIn normal times, personal space isn't a concept for busy New Yorkers, who pack themselves like sardines into subway cars. However, during the pandemic, it's essential to be mindful about how much room you're taking up on the sidewalk. It's okay to go on walks with members from your household, but step aside when around strangers. Make sure you're staying 6 feet apart, and if there's someone nearby, rearrange yourself into a single file to make passing safer.\n\nWorking from home shouldn't change your behavior much, says Maggie Craddock, founder of Workplace Relationships. If you wouldn't alert your team if you're stepping out for 20 minutes in an office setting, there's no need to do so now, either.\n\nVideoconference calls through Zoom or Google Hangouts have become the norm, but they should be used wisely, says Craddock. \"Everybody's moods are so fluid right now,\" she says. So ask your team if they'd prefer to do a call over video or by phone. \"One day, people might be dying to see each other's expressions\"; other days, not so much.\n\nBe extra kind\u2014to your teammates, who are also under additional strain, and to yourself. If you're feeling burnt out or dealing with a personal problem, be honest about it, and ask for assistance. \"If you're honest and direct about it, people are usually willing to help,\" she says.\n\nIf you're living with someone who isn't taking social distancing seriously, be blunt, says Matt Lundquist, a psychotherapist and the founder of Tribeca Therapy. \"People need to say, 'Sorry, I know you think I'm being unreasonable, but I need to really insist on this,'\" he says. If they push back (don't be the person who pushes back!), say something like, \"You don't need to agree on all the nuances of what is and isn't risky, but you do need to respect me.\"\n\nFor other issues, compromise is key. Adults moving back into their parents' house should be extra careful to keep the peace right now\u2014which can mean reigning it in when you want to sound off. This is not the time to have fights that make you re-evaluate your relationship with your mother. \"People are needing to make concessions to survive,\" says Lundquist.\n\nThose concessions can come into play with couples, too. \"One partner [may] drink too much,\" says Lundquist. \"I think this is not the moment to be getting in a fight around that.

    " Title: Presidential Campaign 2020: A Look at the Current Political Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2020 Presidential campaign is shaping up to be an intriguing spectacle, with several potential candidates considering their participation. Mitt Romney, a former Republican candidate, is reportedly contemplating a return to the political arena, possibly attracting support from donors who previously backed Jeb Bush.\n\nHillary Clinton's campaign continues to garner attention, but there is uncertainty regarding a potential title should she be elected. Suggestions such as \"Madame President,\" \"Mrs. President,\" and \"Miss President\" have been proposed, with each carrying its own set of connotations.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, known for his affable yet sometimes gaffe-prone demeanor, remains a contender. His recent suggestion to gun owners to take a shotgun to the front porch and fire at night has sparked controversy.\n\nThe Republican establishment is grappling with taking Donald Trump's campaign seriously, as he maintains a lead in polls. Trump, referred to as an \"outlier\" or \"outsider,\" has attracted criticism for his unconventional political style and controversial remarks.\n\nThe liberal media has been critical of Trump's recent rally in Mobile, Alabama, where he reportedly drew a crowd of 20,000 people in a stadium seating 30,000. The crowd size has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that the event exposed empty seats and invited unfavorable comparisons.\n\nPresident Obama made waves on Monday by suggesting that he might endorse a candidate in the Democratic primaries, hinting that it may not be Hillary Clinton. In a statement, press secretary Josh Earnest expressed admiration for Vice President Joe Biden's political experience and understanding of campaign strategy, without explicitly endorsing him.\n\nAn Obama endorsement could carry significant weight in the Democratic primary, signaling support for a candidate who will uphold his legacy. However, in a general election, an Obama endorsement might be perceived as a liability, as some voters may view Obama's presidency as a historical anomaly.\n\nThe Republican establishment's apprehension about Donald Trump stems from the fear that his unconventional style and lack of political experience could lead to an electoral defeat, much like the 1940 Republican nomination of Wendell Willkie, a Wall Street lawyer with no prior political experience. The Republican grassroots, a minority of a minority, are reportedly seeking a candidate who will deliver \"rough justice\" without mercy.\n\n-Wesley Pruden, Editor Emeritus of The Washington Times.",
    " Title: OPM Data Breach: Lawmakers Call for Change as OPM Director Faces Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a potential data breach affecting up to 32 million Americans, lawmakers have called for changes in leadership at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) following a hearing on Wednesday. Katherine Archuleta, the director of the OPM, faced criticism from key lawmakers over her handling of the agency's cybersecurity.\n\nDuring the hearing, Archuleta acknowledged that she herself may be a victim of the breach and took the matter seriously. However, her performance was described as uneven, with lawmakers expressing dissatisfaction and calling for a housecleaning at the agency.\n\nCommittee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, stated, \"I think you\u2019re part of the problem. I think if you want different results, we\u2019re going to have to have different people.\" He also addressed OPM Chief Information Officer Donna K. Seymour, stating, \"You\u2019re in over your head.\"\n\nThe hearing followed a report by a cybersecurity firm that found federal employees' login and password information scattered across the internet, with dozens of agencies vulnerable to the same type of hack that affected the OPM. The OPM has acknowledged losing data in two breaches: one intrusion stole personal information of about 4.2 million current and former federal employees, and hackers in the second breach gained access to the background check system, with some of the most sensitive information on millions of Americans who have filled out the government's background check packet.\n\nDespite the White House's insistence that President Obama still has faith in Archuleta, Congress has expressed growing impatience. Archuleta refused to disclose the total number of people affected by the data breaches, stating that the OPM cannot determine how many had information stolen in the more intrusive hack of federal background check systems.\n\nAt the hearing, Archuleta vehemently denied press reports that 18 million people had been breached, but she could not rebut Chaffetz's speculation that the number could be nearly twice that. In addition to a modernization plan to update its systems, the OPM has also released a cybersecurity plan that includes hiring a cybersecurity adviser by August 1 and learning best practices from industry leaders.\n\nThe OPM's inspector general, Patrick McFarland, expressed major concerns with Archuleta's staff's approach and predicted the costs will far exceed the $93 million the OPM has projected. McFarland stated, \"The approach that they\u2019re taking, I believe, will fail. They\u2019re going too fast. They\u2019re not doing the basics. And if that\u2019s the case, then we\u2019re going to have a lot of problems down the road.\"\n\nCriticism also extended to some of the contractors that work with the OPM and suffered their own breaches, including U.S. Investigations Services and Keypoint Government Solutions.",
    " Title: Potential Latino Vice Presidential Candidates for Mitt Romney\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's potential vice presidential pick is generating significant discussion, with several Latino politicians being mentioned as possibilities. Beyond Sen. Marco Rubio, other Latinos being considered include Govs. Susanna Martinez of New Mexico and Brian Sandoval of Nevada.\n\nHistorically, Republican presidential candidates have had difficulty courting Latinos, with the best performance being George W. Bush in 2004, who received 44% of the Hispanic vote. In 2008, only 31% of Latinos voted for Sen. John McCain, while nearly 7 in 10 voted for then-Sen. Barack Obama.\n\nGOP strategist Leslie Sanchez stated, \"Republicans need about 40% of the Hispanic vote to be competitive nationally. To add a candidate who happens to be of Hispanic descent is incredibly important, not only because it shows the party can be inclusive, but open-minded Latino independent voters will really see this is a reason to take a second look at the Republican party.\"\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Susanna Martinez is a gun-toting conservative and the first Latina governor in U.S. history. However, she has clashed with fellow Hispanics in New Mexico due to her stance on illegal immigration and her desire to reverse a state law allowing illegal immigrants to get drivers' licenses.\n\nNevada Gov. Brian Sandoval is a budget-cutting, government-shrinking Republican, but he favors abortion rights, which could be a drawback as a GOP running mate. Sandoval is Latino but does not speak Spanish.\n\nAlberto Gonzales, the first Latino U.S. attorney general, stated that a Hispanic at the top of the ticket may help lure Latino voters, but not a vice president. He emphasized that experience is key, and all three potential candidates - Rubio, Martinez, and Sandoval - were elected to their posts less than 18 months ago.\n\nOne challenge in picking a Latino running mate is the diversity within the Hispanic-American community. Rubio is Cuban-American, while Martinez is Mexican-American. In the Latino community, each poses risks for potential culture clashes. Two-thirds of Hispanics in the United States are of Mexican descent, and a much smaller percentage, about 4%, are Cuban.\n\nSome Latino politicians and strategists argue that Hispanics are a natural constituency for the GOP, not the Democratic party. Many Latino voters tend to be fiscally and socially conservative.\n\nThe source of the decades-old GOP problem among Hispanic voters is historically doing little to no outreach. That has changed in recent years, but the fight over immigration reform has hampered efforts, which many Hispanic voters perceive as anti-Latino.\n\nRomney's stance on illegal immigration during the GOP primary battle turned particularly strident, which Republican Latino strategists worry may not exactly pull voters to the GOP. While GOP Hispanics such as Gonzales and Sanchez disagree over whether a Latino running mate would really help Romney with Latino voters, they do agree it would be, when it comes to inclusiveness, an extremely important gesture. And it may help Republicans with Latinos in the long run.\n\nGonzales stated, \"If Governor Romney makes a decision that one of the people you mentioned should be with him on the ticket, and if Governor Romney were to win in November, I mean there would be a great deal of pride in the Hispanic community in having that person being in that position.\"",
    " Title: Senate Confirmation of Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State Faces Opposition Despite Qualifications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe confirmation of Mike Pompeo as the U.S. Secretary of State is facing opposition despite his qualifications, with the fight not centered on his abilities but rather a power play to deny President Trump a top cabinet official.\n\nPompeo, currently the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), has been praised for his competent leadership and respect among intelligence professionals. His extensive experience, having served as a congressman since 2011, and his impressive academic credentials, including graduating top of his class at West Point and attending Harvard Law School, where he edited the Harvard Law Review, are undisputed.\n\nHowever, some Democratic senators, such as Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, have expressed opposition to Pompeo's nomination due to his personal views on issues like gay marriage and abortion. This has led to the Foreign Relations Committee, for the first time, withholding its support for a secretary of state nominee.\n\nDespite the opposition, Pompeo is expected to be confirmed, but he may require Democratic votes due to the narrow Republican majority in the Senate. The reduced majority is a result of the controversial support of Roy Moore in Alabama by Steve Bannon and the absence of John McCain, as well as the obstructionist stance of Rand Paul on budgetary matters and foreign affairs.\n\nSenator Rand Paul's opposition to Pompeo, despite his own party's agenda and President Trump, is a matter of intrigue in Washington. Another Republican, Jeff Flake of Arizona, has hinted at opposing Pompeo based on travel restrictions to Cuba, but this issue is not considered significant enough to block a secretary of state nomination, especially given the ongoing mystery surrounding the damaging sound attacks on U.S. embassy employees in Havana.\n\nA glimmer of support for Pompeo's nomination came from Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, who announced her support yesterday. More red-state Democrats are expected to follow suit, but the confirmation vote is likely to be historically narrow, reflecting the intense opposition to President Trump among Democrats and a potential sign of things to come if Democrats regain control of the Senate in the future.",
    " Title: Senate Averts Government Shutdown with Passage of Stopgap Spending Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate passed a stopgap spending bill on Friday, averting a potential government shutdown. The bill, which keeps federal agencies running until April 28, was passed with a vote of 63-36. The Senate also wrapped up a contentious water projects bill and other last-minute business, allowing senators to leave for the holidays.\n\nThe spending bill, known as a \"continuing resolution,\" maintains most government agencies at 2016 funding levels but increases defense spending by $8 billion annually. The bill also provides $4.1 billion in disaster relief and reconstruction funds, as well as $170 million for addressing drinking water problems, including the lead-tainted water in Flint, Michigan.\n\nThe main sticking point in the passage of the bill was a standoff over coal miners' health benefits. Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and other Democrats had pushed for a year-long extension of the benefits, but ultimately conceded defeat and agreed to a four-month renewal.\n\nIncoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, stated that the party's push for the year-long extension was not intended to shut down the government, but rather to highlight the seriousness of the issue. The House of Representatives had already left for the year, and Senate GOP leaders had warned Democrats to accept the measure as-is or take the blame for a partial government shutdown.\n\nThe water projects bill, which easily passed the House with a vote of 360-61, also faced opposition from some Democrats who wanted to include a \"Buy America\" provision requiring infrastructure projects to use U.S.-made steel and iron. However, their protests gradually subsided as the threat of a shutdown became more imminent.\n\nThe bill is the only one of the dozen annual spending bills that Congress is supposed to approve each year, leaving most agencies running on stopgap funding since October 1, the start of the fiscal year. The latest bill also includes $7 million to reimburse law enforcement agencies protecting President-elect Donald Trump in Manhattan and a provision clearing the way for retired Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis to be Mr. Trump's defense secretary. The law requires at least seven years to have elapsed before a retired member of the military can take over at the Pentagon, but Republicans want to quickly approve a waiver of the law next year. The new bill changes the usual debate rules, preserving the 60-vote threshold but limiting the amount of time a Democratic filibuster could last.",
    " Title: Ferguson Voter Registration Numbers Corrected: Director of Elections Admits Error in Reporting\n\nArticle:\n\nUSA Today's Yamiche Alcindor reported on October 7 that the local director of elections in Ferguson, Missouri, had miscalculated the number of residents who registered to vote following the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown. The actual number is 128, not 3,287 as previously reported.\n\nThe director of elections stated, \"A discrepancy was identified in the report that provided us with the numbers we released to you last week.\" After two days of meetings with the Secretary of State's Office, they were given the correct number.\n\nYamiche Alcindor also reported that the director of elections was \"flabbergasted\" by the mistake but that it was \"a mistake, pure and simple... no hanky-panky.\" The secretary of state's office confirmed that the St. Louis County Election Board had pulled the wrong report.\n\nPreviously, it was reported that since the shooting, 4,839 people in St. Louis County registered to vote, and 3,287 of those people lived in Ferguson. This number was significantly higher than the number of people who registered to vote in Ferguson in 2002, 2006, and 2010, according to a report from the St. Louis County Board of Election Commissioners.\n\nThe surge in voter registrations may not necessarily translate to thousands of new votes. Only 1,484 of the 12,096 registered voters cast ballots during local elections in April. However, if 12 percent of new registrants vote, that's 400 more voters, certainly enough to impact a municipal election.\n\nThe rise in registrations could reflect efforts, particularly by St. Louis committeeman Anthony Bell, to sign people up to vote during and after the height of the protests. The surge in voter registrations may reflect the residents' desire for change in their local government, as many of Ferguson's residents have expressed concern that their local government does not represent the city's black community. Although 67 percent of Ferguson's population is black, the mayor and police chief are white, one of six council members is black, and no one on the local board of elections is black.\n\nThe problem, as previously reported, is low voter turnout during local elections in March and April. The overall turnout numbers for Ferguson's mayoral and city council election are discouraging, with just 12.3 percent of eligible voters casting a ballot in 2014, according to numbers provided by the county. In 2013 and 2012, those figures were even lower: 11.7 percent and 8.9 percent, respectively. As a rule, the lower the turnout, the more the electorate skews white and conservative.",
    " Title: Treasury Secretary Warns of 'Catastrophic' Consequences if Debt Limit Not Raised\n\nArticle:\n\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew warned Congress on Thursday that failing to raise the debt ceiling could cause significant disruption in financial markets and harm the U.S. economy. The government will run out of its ability to borrow money starting on Oct. 17, and will soon after not be able to pay all government bills on time and in full, according to Treasury.\n\nLew's warning comes as some Republicans have questioned the severity of the situation and suggested there is more time to negotiate over a debt limit hike than Treasury has stated. In a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Lew urged lawmakers to avoid an \"ideological fight\" that could put the entire economy at risk.\n\nRepublicans have been critical of Lew, arguing he is trying to scare financial markets to get Congress to boost the debt ceiling without attaching a budget deal or changes to the president's health care law to the legislation. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told Lew at Thursday's hearing that the administration is causing needless panic with suggestions that Social Security recipients and disabled workers would see deep cuts without an increase in the debt limit while failing to explain how the government could manage a default.\n\nLew did not rule out the possibility of prioritizing payments to bondholders in the event of a default, but did not provide details of how Treasury would manage a default. He also questioned what meaningful difference there is between paying bondholders and not paying other government creditors, such as Social Security recipients or contractors.\n\nUnder questioning from Hatch, Lew declined to say specifically how large of a debt limit increase the administration wants, telling the committee the president will sign any bill that avoids default and does not contain other policy provisions.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 180 points in early morning trading on Thursday, with financial markets more interested in reports of growing interest in Congress for passing a short-term debt ceiling increase. The Senate Finance Committee's top Republican, Sen. Orrin Hatch, expressed concern about the administration's warnings of financial stability risks arising from the debt limit impasse, stating that the Financial Stability Oversight Council has been silent and refused to tell the American people how it would respond to these risks.",
    " Title: College Students as Agents of Change in Countering Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nFew would dispute the growing political polarization in the United States over the past few decades. The Brookings Institution, one of America's oldest and most reputable think tanks, labels political polarization as \"damaging to the political process\" and warns that the growing ideological gulf in the society is now deeply embedded.\n\nPolitical polarization is not the result of specific political events such as Sen. Ted Cruz's marathon filibuster against the Affordable Care Act or the October 2013 battle over the debt ceiling that led to a 16-day government shutdown. Instead, political polarization stems from the American people themselves. A study by the Pew Research Center found that Americans self-segregate politically, clustering geographically by ideology, and consume news with a bias towards their beliefs.\n\nPolitical polarization may seem an unsolvable problem due to its vast scale. The actions and motivations of politicians like Cruz, former Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders, or Republican candidates Dr. Ben Carson and Donald Trump may appear beyond our control. However, as Northwestern students, we cannot ignore our responsibility as young Americans and future political leaders to address our nation's problems.\n\nTackling political polarization is a bottom-up project, best approached by those of us in the best position to engage with individuals of differing views: college students. Ending political polarization requires understanding and empathy. The first step in countering political polarization is understanding what people of differing ideologies actually believe. More often than not, I have found that liberals and conservatives fundamentally do not understand each other's views and often make little effort to do so.\n\nUpon arrival at NU, I joined non-partisan political organizations, such as the NU Political Union and Politics & Policy, with the hope of engaging with students of differing political perspectives. The Political Union's weekly debates expanded my understanding of conservatives' political perspectives. Over the past few years, Political Union members have discussed similar experiences with me, how listening to debates changed their understanding of others' beliefs.\n\nMore importantly, the friendships I developed with Republican, libertarian, centrist, and even more radically liberal students than myself through the Political Union and my freshman and sophomore residential hall, deepened my understanding of differing viewpoints on a personal level. The second step to ending political polarization is reaching a point of empathy, where students' differing views are understandable on an emotional and experiential level. Developing strong friendships with people of differing ideologies gives a glimpse into how fellow students' experiences have shaped their political beliefs. Empathy counteracts the most insidious element of political polarization, the notion that your opposition is inherently bad, or even evil.\n\nPolitical polarization goes beyond the Democrat-Republican divide. It touches overarching campus debates, such as the struggle over political correctness, to issues deeply sensitive and personal to so many students on campus, such as Israel-Palestine. For many of those students most involved in discussions of these issues, politics are integral to identity. Discussing ongoing regional conflicts or what constitutes offensiveness is undoubtedly difficult for those most directly affected. It is nonetheless important. The first step is spending time with one's ideological opposites; social psychological research shows that intergroup contact reduces animosity, even between groups on the opposite sides of enduring, deeply entrenched conflict.\n\nCollege is the single best opportunity to bridge the ideological divide. Before social mores prohibit discussion of politics in work and various social settings, sit down with fellow NU students and talk politics. Establish boundaries\u2014no personal attacks, a la Donald Trump, for example\u2014pick a topic, and go. When politics are too sensitive to start with, build trust and establish a bond with fellow students before touching on the more difficult issues. It is time we, as future voters and political leaders, took steps to end political polarization and self-segregation on our own campus, reached out, and built friendships with those who disagree with us. With each discussion, empathy builds, and political polarization, at least on a micro-scale, subsides.",
    " Title: GOP's Response to COVID-19 Pandemic: A Look at Voter Preferences and Policy Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll by The New York Times and Siena College reveals that voters overall prioritize controlling the pandemic over reopening the economy, but this preference appears to be more pronounced among Democratic voters. Republican voters, seemingly influenced by the White House and Fox News, hold the opposite view.\n\nThe divide in attitudes extends beyond policy decisions, as partisanship seems to influence individual behavior as well. Self-identified Democrats are significantly more likely to wear face masks and practice social distancing than self-identified Republicans.\n\nThe question arises as to why the United States has struggled to manage the pandemic effectively, but the focus of this article is on the Republican Party's response to the coronavirus.\n\nPart of the explanation lies in short-term politics. At the beginning of the year, President Donald Trump's re-election message centered on economic triumphalism, with low unemployment rates and rising stock markets. The administration wasted crucial weeks denying the viral threat due to a reluctance to acknowledge bad news.\n\nMoreover, they advocated for premature reopening, aiming to restore conditions as they seemed in February. Even recently, the same Trump officials who initially downplayed the risks of Covid-19 dismissed the potential risks of a second wave.\n\nWhile the GOP's coronavirus denial can be partly attributed to short-term politics and the 2020 election, it is argued that the roots of this response go deeper. Covid-19, like climate change, is a menace the party is reluctant to acknowledge.\n\nIt is not that the right is averse to fearmongering. However, it does not want individuals to fear impersonal threats requiring policy responses, such as wearing face masks, but rather to be afraid of people they can hate\u2014people of a different race or liberal individuals.",
    " Title: Tillerson Departs, Warns of Russia's \"Troubling Behavior\"; Pompeo Tapped as New Secretary of State\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who was sacked as the U.S. Secretary of State, has issued a statement warning of Russia's \"troubling behavior and actions\" in a parting statement. Tillerson, who was fired by President Donald Trump via Twitter, did not thank the president or praise his policies in the statement.\n\nTillerson had a series of public rifts with the White House after being appointed last year. He spoke to reporters at the Department of State, stating that good work had been done to have better relations with China and rein in North Korea's nuclear weapons program. However, he added that \"much work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government.\"\n\nTillerson's departure comes as Mike Pompeo, the current CIA Director, is set to replace him. Gina Haspel, who will become the CIA's first female director, was also named by Trump in the same tweet. Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Tuesday, Trump stated that his differences with Tillerson came down to personal \"chemistry.\"\n\nTillerson will not officially leave until March 31, but his deputy, John Sullivan, will take over running the State Department pending the confirmation of Pompeo. Tillerson stated that it is important to ensure an orderly and smooth transition during a time that the country continues to face significant policy and national security challenges.\n\nThe White House and Tillerson have had a series of public disagreements, and the circumstances surrounding his firing have been a subject of contention. The White House insists Tillerson received a phone call on Friday from Chief of Staff John Kelly, who told him that he was being let go. They say Tillerson then asked if the announcement could be held until his return from a tour of Africa.\n\nHowever, Tillerson's team stated that he felt unwell on Saturday and decided to cut short his tour by a day. His firing was reported by the Washington Post on Tuesday before any tweet was sent, according to a White House official. A statement released by Under Secretary Steve Goldstein implied that Tillerson was first made aware of his firing by President Trump's tweet. After this statement was released, Mr. Goldstein himself was fired by the White House.\n\nTillerson also stated that he received a call from the president about three hours after Mr. Trump sent a tweet announcing his departure. The end of Tillerson's tenure as Secretary of State was a \"perfect metaphor for the relationship,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nA US Senate report found that Ms. Haspel, the new CIA deputy director, ran a CIA prison in Thailand where prisoners were waterboarded in 2002. Haspel was also accused of destroying dozens of videotapes of interrogations at the camp.\n\nPompeo, the new Secretary of State, is a hardline conservative former lawmaker from Kansas and a Trump loyalist. In 2014, he defended the CIA officers who waterboarded detainees as \"patriots.\" Both the new Secretary of State and CIA Director will have to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nReports had swirled since last year of a rift between Trump and his top diplomat. Last October, Tillerson was forced to convene a news conference to deny claims he planned to quit, though he did not address a report that he had referred to his boss as a \"moron\" after a Pentagon meeting.\n\nTrump also publicly undercut Tillerson by tweeting that he was \"wasting his time\" trying to negotiate with North Korea. In December, the Secretary of State offered to begin direct talks with Pyongyang without preconditions. The White House distanced itself from his remarks, and Tillerson was reported to be astonished at how little Trump grasped the basics of foreign policy.",
    " Title: Mental Health Professionals and Political Opponents: A Historical Perspective and Ethical Considerations\n\nArticle:\n\nA debate has arisen regarding the mental health of President Donald Trump, with some mental health professionals suggesting that he may be suffering from conditions such as dementia or other mental illnesses. This has led to discussions about the possibility of removing the president from office or requiring him to undergo psychiatric or psychological testing.\n\nThe author, a former professor of psychiatry at Yale University and co-editor of a basic text in the field, argues that it is unprofessional, unethical, and absurd for mental health professionals to offer diagnoses or predictions about President Trump without examining him. The author, who has written extensively on the ability and inability of psychiatrists to predict future conduct, states that it is dangerous to democracy to pathologize or psychiatrize political opponents based on their political views.\n\nThe author draws parallels to the 1964 presidential election, when similar allegations were made against Senator Barry Goldwater, who was running against President Lyndon B. Johnson. In the lead-up to the election, an article in Fact magazine, based on interviews with over 1,100 psychiatrists, concluded that Goldwater was mentally unstable and psychologically unfit to be president. The author notes that the misdiagnosis of Goldwater should not be surprising, as none of the psychiatrists had ever examined or met the Arizona senator, and their diagnoses were based on their political disagreements with him.\n\nThe author argues that it is unethical for mental health professionals to offer diagnoses or predictions about public figures without examining them, a principle established by the American Psychiatric Association following the Goldwater-psychiatrist debacle. The author concludes that while it is appropriate to debate the merits and demerits of President Trump's policies, effectiveness, personality, and other factors relevant to his presidency, it is irresponsible to remove a duly elected president from office based on amateurish speculation about his mental health. The author emphasizes that diagnoses should be left to doctors who have examined their patients.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Advocates for Constitutional Amendment to Limit Campaign Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has announced his support for a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at limiting campaign spending by outside groups. The amendment, introduced earlier this year by Democratic Sens. Tom Udall of New Mexico and Michael Bennet of Colorado, would give Congress the authority to regulate raising and spending limits for federal elections.\n\nReid announced on the Senate floor that the Judiciary Committee would soon hold a hearing on the amendment, and that the full Senate will vote on the legislation. The measure, if passed, would curb unlimited campaign spending, particularly by super PACs, which have grown significantly since the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case.\n\nThe amendment is expected to pass the Judiciary Committee, where it only needs a simple majority to advance. However, its chances of passing the full Senate, where it needs a two-thirds majority, are extremely slim due to broad GOP opposition.\n\nReid has been vocal in his criticism of the billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch, who have spent hundreds of millions since 2010, through the conservative non-profit political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity and other organizations, to attack Democrats and support Republicans. Overall, pro-GOP outside groups have heavily outspent their pro-Democratic rivals since the 2010 Supreme Court ruling opened the floodgates.\n\n\"There is absolutely no question the Koch brothers are in a category of their own, in both degree and kind. No one else pumping money into the shadowy campaign organizations and campaigns like they are. There isn't even a close second,\" Reid said. \"They are doing this to promote issues that make themselves even richer.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) criticized the amendment, stating that it represents an all-out assault on the right to free speech and is a clear sign of Democrats' desperation to hold onto power.\n\nThe issue of campaign spending was also in the Supreme Court's spotlight earlier this spring, with a 5-4 ruling eliminating limits on how much money individuals can donate in one election season. The decision left intact the current $5,200 limit on how much an individual can give to any single candidate during a two-year election cycle. The ruling means a wealthy donor can give as much money as desired to federal election candidates across the country, as long as no candidate receives more than the $5,200 cap.\n\nThe constitutional amendment faces all-but-certain defeat on the Senate floor, but Democrats believe public opinion is on their side, and that the efforts to push the amendment could motivate their base, which is crucial in traditionally low-turnout midterm contests.",
    " Title: House Republicans Introduce Bill to Allow Americans to Keep Their Health Plans Amidst ObamaCare Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the failure to derail ObamaCare during the partial government shutdown, congressional Republicans have shifted their focus to a House Republican-backed bill that would allow Americans to keep their health plans. The bill, scheduled for a vote on Friday, capitalizes on President Obama's apology last week for earlier assurances that the public could stay on their health insurance if they liked it.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee bill aims to address the controversy surrounding the ObamaCare website's failed rollout last month. The bill is part of escalating attacks on the Affordable Care Act, with members in both chambers now using the website's technical problems as a new line of attack.\n\nRepublicans have targeted various aspects of the website failures, from contractors who helped build the site to suggesting the site's technical problems are just \"the tip of the iceberg.\" The centerpiece of the attack has been pressing Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius into testifying before a House committee earlier this month.\n\nEnergy committee Chairman Fred Upton appears to have seized on the Obama apology as a means to garner Democratic support for the chamber's bill. \"Actions speak louder than words,\" Upton said. \"If the president is serious about offering relief to Americans whose health plans are being canceled, then he should strongly support the Keep Your Health Plan Act.... The president ought to embrace the bipartisan call for legislative action.\"\n\nIn addition to the House bill, Republicans have also proposed legislation to delay the mandate that Americans get insurance and to verify that low-income people receiving federal subsidies to pay for the insurance indeed qualify for them.\n\nSome Democrats, particularly those seeking re-election next year in conservative-leaning states, are also trying to change the law. Among them are Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, who are also facing conservative groups vowing to spend millions to show voters their early support for ObamaCare.\n\nLandrieu, in fact, introduced a bill last week similar to the House one that would allow Americans to keep their existing health plans. \"When we passed the Affordable Care Act, we did so with the intention that if you liked your health plan, you could keep it,\" she said. \"A promise was made and this legislation will ensure that this promise is kept. I have said repeatedly that the... act is not perfect, and I am willing to work with anyone who wants to improve it and implement it correctly.\"\n\nRepublican strategists insist that focusing on ObamaCare throughout the 2016 presidential election cycle is a winning strategy, pointing to the recent Virginia governor's race in which Republican nominee Ken Cuccinelli lost but managed to close a double-digit lead by hammering away at the law in the closing weeks of the campaign.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Rules Out Negotiations on Senate's Immigration Bill, Signaling Stalemate\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner, in a meeting with fellow Republicans on Wednesday, flatly rejected the possibility of entering into negotiations with the Senate on the Senate's immigration bill, signaling that the issue may remain unaddressed until after the midterm elections. Boehner stated that he would not be bound by President Obama's timeline for action and rejected the Senate's approach, which would legalize most illegal immigrants and rewrite the legal immigration system.\n\nBoehner emphasized the House's intention to adopt a step-by-step, common-sense approach to immigration, stating that the House would not take up the 1,300-page Senate bill, which was passed without thorough review. He also made it clear that the House has no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill.\n\nThis stance represents a shift in Boehner's position, as he had previously expressed a willingness to work with President Obama on the issue following Obama's re-election a year ago. Boehner's use of the term \"comprehensive,\" which is often associated with the broad legalization approach advocated by Obama and Democrats, has been a point of contention in the immigration debate.\n\nImmigrant rights supporters remain hopeful that action will be taken in the House next year, citing political pressure as a potential catalyst. Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who wrote the Senate bill, expressed belief that the House will eventually come to its senses and address the issue in a bipartisan manner.\n\nThe Senate bill, which called for quick legal status for most illegal immigrants, included provisions for border security, increased funding for the Border Patrol, and changes to the legal immigration system to prioritize job skills and deep family ties. House Republicans have opted for a piecemeal approach, with committees clearing bills on border security, interior enforcement, and guest-worker programs, and leaders working on a bill to legalize young illegal immigrants.\n\nCongressional Democrats and President Obama had hoped that the House would pass some of these bills, leading to a conference committee to finalize a deal with the Senate. However, Boehner's recent statements suggest a shift in the House's position, with Boehner asking House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte to develop a broad set of principles for addressing immigration.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney expressed skepticism, stating that it seemed \"a little bit late in the game\" and noting that Obama has already laid out principles for the House to follow. Immigrant rights advocates have criticized the House Republicans' approach, with Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a lobby group, stating that Boehner risks his party's political future by stalling action on immigration.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, has been vocal in her support for immigration reform, tweeting that taking up immigration should be easy for the House. Pelosi has introduced a bill that would strip out the specific, tough border security measures from the Senate's legalization program and replace them with a call for the Department of Homeland Security to devise a security plan. Pelosi believes the House has enough votes to pass her bill.\n\nFollowing Obama's re-election last year, Boehner had announced that immigration would be a key area of agreement between the president and House Republicans. However, the backlash from rank-and-file House Republicans has forced Boehner and his lieutenants to navigate a difficult path to maintain support within their conference. Even Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who helped craft the Senate bill, later abandoned it, urging his House colleagues to follow their own path and avoid negotiations with the Senate.",
    " Title: Trump Imposes Tariffs on Brazil and Argentina, Sparking Uncertainty and Currency War Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina, a move that has been met with criticism from the left and business leaders seeking more certainty in the global trade landscape. This latest move marks a shift in Trump's rationale for the tariffs, as he now claims that the two South American nations are manipulating their currencies.\n\nIn 2018, Trump first imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, citing national security concerns. This new rationale, however, is a departure from his previous statements. The announcement of the new tariffs also saw Trump call on the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, a move that could weaken the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe economic situations in both Brazil and Argentina are complex. Argentina's right-leaning government, led by the soon-to-be outgoing President Mauricio Macri, has been battling a financial crisis, including struggling to control the falling peso. Brazil's own currency has also suffered recently, with the situation in Argentina partially to blame, according to Trump's own Treasury Department. As of May, neither Brazil nor Argentina were on the watch list of countries requiring closer attention to their currency practices.\n\nThe political implications of Trump's announcement are somewhat peculiar. Brazil's new right-wing populist President Jair Bolsonaro has strengthened the country's relationship with the Trump administration, and Trump had previously talked up a possible US-Brazil free trade deal. The US-China trade spat has rattled the global economy, and Trump is still waging a trade battle with the EU, though some of the recent tariffs were allowed by the World Trade Organization. He has yet to get his revised NAFTA deal through Congress, though there's still hope there.\n\nThis latest incident has opened the door for China to potentially accelerate its push into Latin America. In the realm of trade talks with China, investors are betting that President Donald Trump will deliver a partial trade deal soon, boosting anemic economic growth, sustaining the bull market in stocks, and offering the hope of calmer waters for global commerce. However, the prospect of a phase one deal, even if it sticks through the 2020 presidential election campaign, may make a broader phase two agreement even harder.\n\nIn the U.S. political landscape, the Democratic presidential candidates are also making headlines. Senator Elizabeth Warren has provided more detail on her Medicare financing than other candidates, including on the taxes she would raise. Her Medicare plan comes much closer to paying for itself than various Republican tax cuts. However, her approach of forcing people to join Medicare, rather than allowing them to opt in, has been criticized for not addressing public anxiety about radical changes to the health care system.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden's opposition to marijuana legalization puts him at odds with the majority of Democrats and even a majority of Republicans, who support legalization. This stance has been a source of concern for criminal justice reformers, as Biden has a long record of pushing for punitive criminal justice and drug policies.\n\nIn summary, the global trade landscape is experiencing further turbulence due to Trump's latest tariff announcement, while the U.S. political landscape is seeing a heated debate on healthcare and drug policy reforms among the Democratic presidential candidates.",
    " Title: U.S. Consumer Prices Increase in June, Inflation Remains Moderate Despite Economic Reopening\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index increased by 0.6% in June, marking the largest monthly rise since August 2012, according to data released by the Labor Department on Tuesday. This increase ended three consecutive months of declines. The increase was primarily driven by rises in the prices of gasoline and food.\n\nIn the 12 months through June, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed 0.6%, following a 0.1% increase in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.5% increase in June and a 0.6% year-on-year rise.\n\nBusinesses have reopened after shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of Covid-19. However, new cases of the respiratory illness have surged in large parts of the country, prompting some states to dial back or pause reopenings.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is injecting money into the economy through extraordinary measures, including large-scale asset purchases and funneling loans to firms. Separately, the government has provided nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus, contributing to a record monthly budget deficit in June.\n\nDespite the unprecedented stimulus, economists expect inflation to remain benign due to a record 33 million people on unemployment benefits. The core Consumer Price Index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.2% in June, following a 0.1% decrease in May.\n\nIn the 12 months through June, the core Consumer Price Index increased 1.2%, matching May's gain. The Federal Reserve tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index increased 1.0% on a year-on-year basis in May, the smallest advance since December 2010. June's core PCE price index data will be released at the end of this month.",
    " Title: Multiple Incidents of Explosions, Stabbings Occur Across U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nMultiple incidents of explosions and stabbings occurred across the United States on Saturday, September 17, 2016.\n\nIn Seaside Park, New Jersey, an improvisational explosive device (IED) detonated at a Marine Charity 5K event. Fortunately, no one was injured. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently investigating to determine if it was an act of terrorism. Remnants and residue from the bomb are being sent to an FBI lab for analysis. The device was enclosed in a trash can and contained multiple explosive devices, designed to send shrapnel flying. There were as many as three devices inside the trash can.\n\nIn Chelsea, a New York City neighborhood, an explosion occurred around 8:30 pm EST, injuring an estimated 25 people but killing none. A possible secondary device may have been discovered, but this is not yet confirmed. There are conflicting reports as to whether the explosion was caused by an IED.\n\nIn St. Cloud, Minnesota, a crazed stabber rampaged and stabbed multiple people before being shot by police. The mall where the incident occurred is still in lockdown, and multiple victims have been taken to the St. Cloud Hospital.\n\nSocial media posts and news reports provide additional details about these incidents. For example, one Twitter user posted a picture of the explosion in Chelsea, and another user shared a picture of their apartment building near the explosion site. There are also conflicting reports about the causes and details of the incidents, with some sources attributing the New York explosion to a bombing, while others are speculating about the type of explosive used in the Seaside Park incident.\n\nAuthorities are still investigating the causes and details of these incidents, and more information is expected to be released over time. The FBI is investigating the Seaside Park incident as a potential act of terrorism, and the St. Cloud stabbing is being investigated as a possible hate crime. The public is advised to avoid the areas where the incidents occurred and to follow the instructions of local authorities.",
    " Title: Clinton Refuses to Hand Over Email Server, Claims Server Wiped Clean in Response to Subpoena\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has declined to turn over her email server to an independent third party, instead claiming she has wiped the server clean. This development has reportedly set back the special investigative committee looking into the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack, according to a statement from Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy late Friday.\n\nGowdy stated that the House will need to decide on the next steps in the pursuit of information from Mrs. Clinton, but she will likely be required to appear and testify about her email-related decision-making. Gowdy's statement criticizes Mrs. Clinton's actions, stating that she was the sole arbiter of what constituted a public record and that she deleted all emails from her server, preventing others from verifying her analysis in the public interest.\n\nIn response to Gowdy's subpoena, Mrs. Clinton reportedly re-transmitted several hundred pages of emails that the State Department has already made public. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the top Democrat on the Benghazi probe, stated that this proves Mrs. Clinton has already produced all of her official records concerning the terrorist attack.\n\nCummings called for the committee to stop the investigation and make the documents public, as well as schedule Mrs. Clinton's public testimony.\n\nAt a press conference earlier this month, Mrs. Clinton explained that she culled through more than 60,000 emails from her time as secretary and decided about 30,000 of them were public records that should have been maintained. She stated that the rest were private messages relating to her daughter's wedding or her yoga class schedule, and she did not keep those.\n\nHowever, Gowdy stated that Mrs. Clinton's lawyers informed him on Friday that she \"unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails\" from it. The exact timing of this decision is unclear, but it appears to have occurred after the State Department requested her to turn over her government business messages in late October.\n\nMrs. Clinton opted to use a private email account during her four-year tenure as secretary, first relying on an account she used while a senator and later setting up an email server at her home in New York and using an account on that to conduct all of her business, both public and private.\n\nShe maintains that she followed the law, which at the time did not require officials to use government-issued accounts but did require them to turn over all official records to be stored. Mrs. Clinton did not turn over those records until last December, after the Benghazi probe noticed she had used a private email and requested those records from the State Department, which then asked Mrs. Clinton for them. The law does not specify a date for turning over records.\n\nOpen-records experts, however, question Mrs. Clinton's designation of her server as private, stating that it was set up to conduct government business, and so it and the emails on it arguably belong to the government.\n\nMrs. Clinton's email practices have put the Obama administration in a difficult position. Obama lawyers have admitted in federal court that for years, they were not correctly performing open-records searches because they did not have her emails, but they claim they are now unilaterally going back and doing those searches.",
    " Title: Polish President Expresses Reservations Over Trump's Proposal to Reinstate Russia in G-7\n\nArticle:\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda voiced serious reservations on Monday about President Donald Trump's campaign to reinstate Russia into the Group of Seven (G-7), an elite group of leaders from wealthy nations. During a news conference with Vice President Mike Pence at Poland's Presidential Palace, Duda did not outright reject Trump's proposal but made it clear he was not enthusiastic about the idea.\n\n\"I believe we must not proceed according to the business-as-usual principle\" when it comes to Russia, Duda said through an interpreter. \"This is my position, and I do not hesitate to express it.\"\n\nDuda's comments came on the second and final day of Pence's visit to the Polish capital. Pence made the trip after Trump canceled his plans to travel to Poland, citing the need to monitor Hurricane Dorian in the United States.\n\nWhile Duda was not supportive of Trump's push to readmit Russia to the G-7, he was sympathetic to Trump's reasons for canceling his visit. Trump had to postpone his visit due to \"the nature of things which cannot be predicted,\" Duda said. Trump has stated his intention to reschedule, and Duda expressed hope that Trump can make the trip this fall.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for leaders of other member nations to allow Russia back into the group in recent weeks. Trump pressed the case last week during the group's annual gathering in Biarritz, France. Trump argued that readmitting Russia to the group would ease negotiations on global issues.\n\nRussia was a member of the group, then known as the G-8, but was ousted in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea. The decision was supported not only by the U.S. but also by the group's other six member countries. The G-7 is made up of the United States, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Italy.\n\nDuring the news conference, Duda, whose country relies heavily on U.S. military support, also expressed concerns about bringing Russia back into the fold, citing Russia's continued occupation of Crimea and other issues.\n\n\"Russia, over the last years, has been undertaking actions which... nobody who wants to have peace in the world, and nobody who respects the dignity of other nations and states, can turn a blind eye to,\" he said.\n\nFor his part, Pence lauded the \"remarkable bond\" between the U.S. and Poland and stressed that NATO allies must remain \"vigilant\" about countering \"the intentions and the actions taken by Russia.\"\n\nDuring his two-day visit to the Polish capital, Pence delivered remarks at a ceremony commemorating the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II and held bilateral meetings with Duda and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn his meeting with Duda, Pence said they discussed several issues, including Poland's plan to buy weaponry from the United States, the U.S.'s plans to send an additional 1,000 troops to Poland, and the possible establishment of a permanent military base for U.S. troops in Poland.\n\n\"Make no mistake about it,\" Pence said. \"This alliance, this relationship between America and Poland, has never been stronger.\"\n\nThe two countries also signed a joint agreement calling for them to work together to improve the security of Poland's 5G telecommunications system. The deal comes as the Trump administration is trying to counter the influence of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei. The U.S. accuses Huawei of facilitating Chinese spying, a charge the company denies.\n\nAsked if Poland has any evidence that China has used Huawei technology for spying, Duda said Polish counterintelligence services have detected actions \"which might have been of an espionage nature.\"",
    " Title: 6th Circuit Court of Appeals Upholds Contraception Mandate, Split with 10th Circuit Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday sided with the Obama administration in the ongoing legal battle over the mandate to cover contraception services in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This decision marks the second time a federal appeals court has rejected a company's claim that the mandatory coverage of birth control violates its religious beliefs.\n\nIn a separate ruling in July, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals granted an injunction to Hobby Lobby, a crafts franchise based in Oklahoma City, shielding the company from the ACA mandate until the merits of their case can be heard. The split rulings suggest the matter may be headed for the Supreme Court in Washington.\n\nIn the latest decision, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a Michigan-based manufacturing company, Autocam, must comply with the mandate despite it violating the owners' Roman Catholic beliefs. The Kennedy family, like other plaintiffs who have sued over the mandate, argued that the Obama administration's rule required them to choose among violating their beliefs, dropping Autocam employees' health coverage, or facing substantial fines for non-compliance.\n\nConservative lawmakers and religious groups have advocated for a religious exemption from the mandate, citing particular objections to morning-after pills they equate with abortion. Supporters of the mandate argue that contraception use is widespread but often unaffordable for many women. They contend that corporate owners should not be able to impose their personal beliefs on the diverse array of people they employ at secular companies by stripping contraception coverage from their health plans.\n\nThe 6th Circuit panel wrote that the Kennedys' actions with respect to Autocam are not actions taken in an individual capacity but as officers and directors of the corporation. The judges agreed with government lawyers who said \"that Autocam has not carried its burden of demonstrating a strong likelihood of success on the merits in this action.\"\n\nIn late July, about a week after Hobby Lobby's successful plea to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, judges on the 3rd Circuit provided no relief to Pennsylvania-based Conestoga Wood Specialties. A decision tracker at the Becket Fund says 29 companies have secured an injunction against the mandate at either the district or circuit court level, while five firms, including Conestoga and Autocam, have been denied relief.\n\nKyle Duncan, general counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which is representing some of the plaintiffs who object to the mandate, said the Obama administration has until Sept. 25 to decide whether it will ask the Supreme Court to take up the Hobby Lobby case that went against them. \"I can't imagine that the United States [government] will just acquiesce in that,\" Mr. Duncan said.\n\nEarlier this year, the Obama administration outlined an accommodation for religious nonprofits such as hospitals and universities that object to the mandate. Under the compromise, employees of the nonprofits can still acquire contraception coverage through separate policies set up by their companies' insurers or third-party administrators. This, the administration said, would allow the faith-based employers to distance themselves from the coverage, although some objectors have said the accommodation does little to alleviate their concerns.",
    " Title: House Republicans Criticize Senate for Failing to Pass Health Care Repeal Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of House Republicans gathered on Capitol Hill on Friday criticized the Senate for failing to pass its health care repeal bill earlier in the day. The House had passed a health care bill in May, and some representatives argued that the Senate had not fulfilled its part of the bargain.\n\nRep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia stated, \"The Senate's got to do the Senate thing. We got a bill passed in the House.\" He further added, \"The Senate needs to decide whether they can do anything. If the Senate is incapable of functioning, then the House will have to once again step up to the plate and figure out what we're going to do.\"\n\nRep. Diane Black, who chairs the House Budget Committee, said senators had broken their promise to \"save\" Americans from Obamacare. \"The Senate's failure to even continue the legislative process is a slap in the face to the voters that trusted and elected them. They deserve better,\" she said.\n\nIn an early-morning vote, the Senate voted down Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's latest offer of a bill that would repeal or delay some of Obamacare's mandates and taxes. The bill failed on a 49-51 vote, with three Republican senators - Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain of Arizona, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska - joining Democrats to doom the legislation.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan was more diplomatic in his response, stating he was \"disappointed and frustrated\" but that lawmakers should not give up. \"While the House delivered a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, unfortunately, the Senate was unable to reach a consensus,\" Mr. Ryan said in a statement.\n\nRep. Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican, suggested that the parliamentary situation in the Senate could make further action difficult. \"We're in a situation here where the parliamentary physics of the existing Senate rule construct makes doing things almost impossible if they're of consequence,\" Mr. Franks said.",
    " Title: Oregon Anti-Government Protesters Labeled as Domestic Terrorists\n\nArticle:\n\nCNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, former assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and founder of Kayyem Solutions, has labeled the armed protesters occupying a federal building in Oregon as domestic terrorists. In her commentary, Kayyem argues that the protesters' actions, regardless of their claims of peacefulness or lawful militia status, constitute terrorism due to their use of violence and disregard for federal law.\n\nThe protesters, led by Ammon Bundy, the son of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, have taken over a federal building in Oregon, claiming they are defending themselves and their cause. Kayyem asserts that their actions are not benign, but rather dangerous, unforgiving, and in violation of federal law.\n\nKayyem suggests that the protesters' cause is difficult to decipher, but it appears to stem from opposition to a rancher being jailed for arson due to his refusal to sell his land. The analyst warns against attempts to downplay the group's actions, stating that they are, in fact, domestic terrorists.\n\nKayyem proposes a strategy for resolving the standoff, emphasizing the importance of avoiding violence and treating the protesters as domestic terrorists. She suggests that federal authorities should adopt a patient approach, giving themselves ample time to respond, and offering reduced sentences or misdemeanor charges to those who disarm and surrender.\n\nKayyem also recommends dividing and conquering the group, offering incentives to some members to disarm and surrender, and reminding those inside that they will be considered accomplices to first-degree murder if a federal agent or public safety official is harmed or killed.\n\nFurthermore, Kayyem suggests that the Obama administration should be prepared to mobilize federal military support if necessary, to make a statement about the rule of law and the importance of upholding it in a civil, democratic society. Local law enforcement officials, she notes, may be biased due to their relationships with the protesters, and a show of federal force could help treat the protesters as they should be treated: as domestic terrorists who are putting the community at risk.\n\nKayyem concludes by referencing the Waco siege in 1993, cautioning against an overly aggressive response that could turn the protesters into martyrs, as was the case in Waco, which radicalized a different round of domestic terrorists.",
    " Title: Democratic Official Clarifies \"Z\" Reference in Ukraine Pressure Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nA Democratic official involved in the impeachment trial has acknowledged that the initial interpretation of a term \"z\" may have been incorrect, but maintains that the term was commonly used as a shorthand for \"Zelensky\" among those involved in the Ukraine pressure campaign. The official also noted that the word document does not reveal its author or source.\n\nThe official emphasized that there is little question that Giuliani and Parnas sought \"high-level engagement with President Zelensky and his administration.\" The official stated, \"Beginning with Mr. Giuliani\u2019s May 10 letter to President Zelensky two months earlier and leading up to Mr. Giuliani\u2019s August 2 meeting with Mr. Zelensky\u2019s representatives in Spain, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Parnas actively sought high-level engagement with President Zelensky and his administration to carry out the President\u2019s corrupt scheme.\"\n\nThe official further added, \"If Mr. Giuliani sought out dirt from other sources, that would be consistent with their overall effort.\"\n\nThere are examples of Giuliani attempting to arrange a meeting with Zelensky, and he did in fact meet with top aides to the Ukrainian president, despite Parnas' role in the matter still being unclear. Democrats have not based their impeachment trial arguments primarily on Parnas' new allegations, making limited references to the former Giuliani associate in their brief.\n\nHowever, it appears that Democrats may have misjudged at least one instance where they thought they found an example of Parnas trying to arrange a meeting between Giuliani and Zelensky, according to the unredacted material. Democrats received the Parnas evidence from the courts only last week and were scrambling to sort through all the materials ahead of the Senate impeachment trial.\n\nA Republican aide criticized the assumption that \"mr Z\" is a reference to Zelensky, stating, \"The most charitable view of the situation is that [Schiff\u2019s] staff committed the equivalent of Congressional malpractice by not looking more than an inch deep to determine the facts before foisting this erroneous information on his colleagues and the American public.\"\n\nThe aide further added, \"Given the selective redactions and contextual clues, it seems as though Chairman Schiff sought to portray an innocuous meeting with Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky as an insidious one with the President of Ukraine simply because both of their surnames start with the letter Z.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl Faces Desertion and Misbehavior Charges\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was held captive by the Taliban in Afghanistan, was formally charged on Wednesday with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The Army stated that if convicted of the most serious count, desertion, Bergdahl could face a life sentence in prison.\n\nAn Article 32 investigation hearing is scheduled for April 22 at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a court-martial. Bergdahl, 28, disappeared on June 30, 2009, from Combat Outpost Mest-Lalak in Paktika Province in eastern Afghanistan and was subsequently captured.\n\nThe Army stated that the investigation, similar to a civilian grand jury proceeding, would determine whether there is enough evidence to proceed with a court-martial. Bergdahl was released from Taliban custody last summer in a controversial prisoner swap that saw five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, transferred to Qatar, where they were required to remain for a year.\n\nSome of Bergdahl's former Army comrades have come forward and stated that he deserted his post. Former Army Sergeant Evan Buetow, who served with Bergdahl, said on Wednesday that the former war prisoner had been treated fairly by the Army and needed \"to answer for what he did.\"\n\n\"He put all of our lives in danger,\" Buetow said. \"Men from our company died, when I do not believe they would have if he would not have left.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers also backed the Army's decision to move ahead with the charges. Senator John McCain, head of the Senate Armed Services Committee and himself a Vietnam War prisoner, said it was an \"important step\" toward determining Bergdahl's accountability.\n\nRepresentative Mac Thornberry, head of the House Armed Services Committee, accused the administration of making the case more difficult by failing \"to follow the law surrounding the release of the Taliban 5.\"\n\nBergdahl's case has been under review by General Mark Milley, head of U.S. Army Forces Command. As a result of the review, Bergdahl was charged with desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty and misbehavior before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command, unit, or place.\n\nThe desertion charge carries a maximum prison term of five years, while the misbehavior count carries a maximum term of life in prison. The charges also carry a number of other potential punishments, including a dishonorable discharge, reduction in rank to private, and forfeiture of all pay.\n\nBergdahl's parents declined to comment on the Army's decision to charge their son. Some residents in his hometown of Hailey, Idaho, also expressed reluctance to comment on the developments, citing anger at the community that came after it showed support for him following his release.\n\nA rally for Bergdahl was abruptly canceled last summer amid the political uproar. The family and several supporters received threats by email and telephone, Hailey officials said. Debbie O'Neill, one of the co-organizers of the canceled rally, said she thought people were shocked by the Army's decision on Wednesday.\n\n\"Other than that, I think we have to wait for the military justice system to play out,\" she said. \"I'm sure the military has enough evidence to back up the charges, but my heart breaks for him (Bergdahl).\"\n\nAfter a period of rehabilitation following his release, Bergdahl was reassigned to military duties. He currently has an administrative role in an office at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio. A spokeswoman at the base said it would be up to the lawyers to determine what would happen to Bergdahl now that he has been charged.",

The meeting, which included Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, reportedly discussed the possibility of a \"brokered national convention\" if there is no clear winner in the party's primary election season.\n\nIn a statement, Carson expressed disapproval of the alleged plan, stating, \"If this was the beginning of a plan to subvert the will of the voters and replace it with the will of the political elite, I assure you Donald Trump will not be the only one leaving the party.\" Carson's statement referenced Trump's repeated threats to leave the GOP if treated \"unfairly.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee did not immediately respond to questions about the meeting and Carson's threat.\n\nA third-party run by Carson or Trump could pose a significant challenge for the GOP. While Carson is slipping in recent polls, an independent bid that siphoned even a few percentage points away from the party's nominee could make it all but impossible for the Republican nominee to win the general election.\n\nSpokesman Doug Watts stated that Carson was appalled at reports suggesting that Republican leaders were trying to manipulate the party's presidential nominating process. He acknowledged that Carson, like Trump and the rest of the Republican field, signed a pledge not to launch a third-party bid.\n\n\"The pledge is not meaningless,\" Watts said. \"But he signed the pledge based on everybody playing by the rules.\"",
    " Title: China's Fervent Celebration of Xi Jinping Recalls Mao Era\n\nArticle:\n\nChina is currently witnessing a wave of enthusiasm not seen since the Mao era, as the country celebrates the leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping. Street-side banners and billboards, Communist Party publicity tours, official choral performances, and song-and-dance routines are some of the methods being employed to promote the party's message.\n\nAccording to a dance troupe director, \"As performers, it's our duty to educate the masses about how they benefit from party and state policies.\"\n\nThe United States, on the other hand, is grappling with its own political and social issues, as demonstrated by the recent wedding cake case heard by the Supreme Court. The case centers on the question of whether a Colorado baker, acting on religious conviction, can deny a gay couple's request for a wedding cake. The state of Colorado has ruled against the baker, and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision is expected to be close, with Justice Anthony Kennedy likely to play a decisive role.\n\nThe larger question at hand is the extent of government power in promoting and enforcing views that are more backed by government power than by popular consensus. In Xi Jinping's China, government power is seemingly limitless, with the party's decrees carrying the force of law. In the United States, consent of the governed has long been a guiding principle.\n\nOne example of government overreach is the practice of busing for racial balance, which, half a century ago, led to forced integration of schools, causing widespread resistance and exacerbating racial segregation.\n\nGovernment attempts to impose conformity in the name of a beneficial cause can ignite controversy and stifle reconciliation, especially when judges impose their views on the masses. Reconciliation, in practice, is often met with resistance by educators and judicial authorities who seek to mold the thoughts and behaviors of the unenlightened masses.\n\nThe \"American way of life\" is a flexible concept, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and lifestyles. It is hoped that freedom from unnecessary government molding of thought and behavior will continue to be a cherished aspect of American society.\n\nThe article concludes by questioning the path that led the United States to its current political climate, where government intervention in personal matters is a contentious issue. The author expresses concern over the potential for government overreach and the stifling of individual freedoms.",
    " Title: Social Media Companies Accused of Allowing Chinese Communist Party Propaganda on U.S. Platforms\n\nArticle:\n\nInvestigators with the House Foreign Affairs Committee have accused major American social media companies, including Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, of allowing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to disseminate propaganda to U.S. audiences with little oversight or warning. The investigation, led by Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), is part of a broader effort by congressional leaders to crack down on China's influence operations in the United States.\n\nThe investigation, presented in the form of report cards, graded each company on whether they have banned CCP officials and news outlets, applied warning labels to their content, and fact-checked their claims for accuracy. All of the websites failed these tests. Twitter received a D-, Facebook a C+, and YouTube a C-, implying each still permits the dissemination of anti-U.S. communist propaganda, often without warning labels for readers.\n\nThe investigation found that Twitter is the platform most heavily abused by the CCP, with the company only applying a fact-check label to a tweet about the coronavirus originating with the U.S. military after it had been on the platform for over a month. Facebook allows several Chinese state-controlled propaganda outlets to freely post misinformation, potentially reaching millions of Americans. YouTube does not block communist officials and news outlets or remove their materials but attempts to fact-check and police this content for inaccuracies.\n\nCongressional investigators remain concerned that China does not rank as a top priority for these websites, with Twitter only fact-checking tweets from prominent voices such as the president. Facebook and YouTube have not taken sufficient action to prevent the CCP from using their platforms to spread propaganda and lies about COVID-19, according to the report.",
    " Title: North Carolina Governor Signs Controversial Election Law Overhaul\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Pat McCrory signed into law on Monday a contentious bill that significantly alters the state's election laws. The new legislation mandates government-issued photo IDs at polling stations, reduces the early voting period by one week, and eliminates same-day registration.\n\nMcCrory, a Republican, referred to the changes as \"common sense reforms\" and asserted that they would safeguard the \"integrity\" of the voting process. In a statement from his office and a 95-second YouTube video, the governor emphasized that residents can obtain a free photo ID at local Department of Motor Vehicle offices across the state. To allow ample time for compliance, McCrory stated that photo ID would not be enforced until the 2016 elections.\n\nDemocrats and minority groups argue that the new law will suppress voting and make it more difficult for minorities, the elderly, and youth to cast their ballots. The American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups have pledged to challenge the changes. The Reverend William Barber, president of the state chapter of the NAACP, told The Associated Press that the law is a \"trampling on the blood, sweat, and tears of the martyrs\u2014black and white\u2014who fought for voting rights in this country.\" He added that the law places McCrory \"on the wrong side of history.\" The NAACP chapter has filed a legal challenge to the measure.\n\nNPR's Kathy Lohr reports that McCrory signed the bill into law just weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a section of the Voting Rights Act that required North Carolina and other states to secure approval from the federal government before altering their election laws. The Justice Department is reportedly considering filing a lawsuit against the new North Carolina law, as it is currently engaged in a similar legal battle over a Texas voting law.",
    " Title: Turkish President Threatens Europe with Refugee Influx Over Syria Operation Label\n\nArticle:\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Europe on Thursday that he would flood the continent with 3.6 million refugees if European leaders label the ongoing Turkish military operation in Syria as an \"occupation.\" According to Reuters, Erdogan made the statement during a meeting with officials from his ruling AK Party.\n\nThe Turkish military operation in northern Syria, which began on Wednesday, involves airstrikes and artillery fire targeting U.S.-allied Kurdish forces on the ground. The operation followed President Donald Trump's surprise announcement last week of a U.S. troop withdrawal from a part of Syria that had been reclaimed in a bloody and prolonged war between the U.S.-led coalition and the Islamic State (IS).\n\nTrump's decision was framed as a move to hand the responsibility of containing IS to the Turks. On Wednesday, Trump defended his decision by stating that the Kurds did not assist the U.S. during World War II. Ground fighting against the extremist group since 2014 was primarily led by Kurdish forces, which make up the majority of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed organization responsible for governance of the area and containment of resurgent IS fighters and overcrowded IS prisons.\n\nIn certain instances, Turkey refused to aid the Kurdish forces in the anti-IS fight, viewing them as allies to dissident Kurds in the country. Erdogan has vowed to rid the area of \"terrorists,\" and claims his objective is to facilitate the return of Syrian refugees in Turkey to their homes. However, numerous U.S. officials have expressed doubt about this promise.\n\nAnkara has long promised to eliminate the Kurdish militia presence along its border in northern Syria, which it views as a security threat and indistinguishable from a separate Kurdish terrorist group waging a counterinsurgency inside Turkey.",
    " Title: Oregon Resident Shares Mixed Feelings on Trump Presidency, Highlights Republican Control of State Legislatures\n\nArticle:\n\nA resident of deep blue Oregon, who did not support Donald Trump during the Republican primaries, has shared their mixed feelings about the President's term so far. Despite not voting for Trump in the general election, the individual expressed excitement when it seemed likely that Trump would win, comparing the feeling to a sports victory.\n\nAccording to CBS News, Republicans have expanded their power in state capitols to their strongest levels in decades. Thirty-three of 50 governors are now Republican, a 95-year high not seen since 1922. Daily Kos notes that Republicans control both legislative chambers in 32 states, while Democrats only control the legislature in 13 states, one of which is Oregon.\n\nThe Oregon resident expressed gratitude for a president who respects law enforcement and the military, and for someone other than Hillary Clinton appointing Supreme Court justices. They were pleased with Trump's Cabinet picks and key appointments, including Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, James Mattis for secretary of Defense, Jeff Sessions for attorney general, Rick Perry for secretary of Energy, and Nikki Haley as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nThe resident also highlighted an aspect of Trump's supporters that they had missed: the president's advocacy for a large, unrepresented segment of Americans, particularly those living in the Rust Belt whose jobs had left, and other Americans who were suffering silently with no spokesperson or lobbyists.\n\nThe resident expressed cautious optimism, stating that the big victory was the Supreme Court nominees being selected by someone other than Clinton. They acknowledged concerns about Trump's temperament and character but were pleasantly surprised by many of his conservative appointments and actions so far.\n\nThe resident also addressed the criticism Trump has faced, particularly regarding his history of despicable comments and credible allegations of sexual assault and unwanted advances. They questioned the hypocrisy of the left in criticizing Trump while seemingly overlooking similar allegations against Bill and Hillary Clinton. The resident called for fair and evenly applied accountability for all parties involved.\n\nDan Lucas, an independent researcher and policy advocate, is the past editor of the conservative blog Oregon Catalyst.

    " Title: The Washington Post Suspends Reporter Felicia Sonmez: A Closer Look at the Controversial Suspension\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Washington Post suspended national political reporter Felicia Sonmez on Monday following her tweet about the death of Kobe Bryant, which linked to a 2016 Daily Beast article detailing Bryant's sexual assault allegations. The reasons behind the suspension remain unclear, with conflicting reports emerging from various sources.\n\nOn Sunday, Sonmez shared a link to the article, which was widely discussed on social media. The level of backlash she received was intense, with Sonmez receiving numerous death threats and abusive messages. In response, Sonmez defended herself, stating that public figures should be remembered in their entirety, even if their totality is unsettling.\n\nThe Post demanded that Sonmez delete her tweets and placed her on administrative leave, according to Erik Wemple, the Post's media critic, who interviewed Sonmez and determined that the paper's suspension was \"misguided.\" Wemple questioned, \"What did Sonmez do to deserve this brushback? She tweeted out a very good story from the Daily Beast.\"\n\nThe Post provided a statement, stating that Sonmez was placed on administrative leave while the paper reviews whether her tweets violated the Post's social media policy. Managing editor Tracy Grant's statement, however, raises questions, as it does not specify any policy violations.\n\nThe Post's social media policy, which dates back to 2016, states that journalists must refrain from posting anything that could objectively be perceived as reflecting political, racial, sexist, religious, or other bias or favoritism. It is unclear how Sonmez's tweets violate these guidelines.\n\nMatthew Keys, citing an unnamed source, reported that Sonmez was suspended because the screenshot she tweeted out revealed the full names of those who had written her. However, Sonmez told Wemple that she had not heard this explanation from the Post. In fact, it was Sonmez who was doxxed, as her address was posted online, and she checked into a hotel out of fear for her safety.\n\nIt is also unclear how Sonmez's tweets \"undermined the work of her colleagues,\" as Grant put it. The Post has published numerous stories on Bryant's death, and Sonmez's social media posts do not appear to have interfered with the coverage.\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on the reasons for Sonmez's suspension, the Post's communications manager, Molly Gannon, stated, \"We do not have anything additional to share.\"\n\nBy suspending Sonmez, the Post has made itself the focal point of a distracting newsroom drama that could have been avoided had it treated one of its employees with a little more respect.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Accuse President Trump of Responsibility for 3D-Printed Gun Availability\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats have accused President Donald Trump of bearing responsibility for the availability of 3D-printed guns, should they end up on the streets, if his administration does not take immediate action to block a Texas company from posting blueprints for the firearms online.\n\nSenator Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts) stated, \"The ball is in his court \u2014 he has a chance to prevent this from happening.\" Markey further added, \"Donald Trump will be totally responsible for every downloadable, plastic AR-15 that will be roaming the streets of our country if he does not act today.\"\n\nThe senator and other congressional Democrats are advocating for legislation aimed at blocking Defense Distributed, the company, from posting downloadable blueprints online. The issue has sparked a wave of legal action following a settlement last month between the State Department and the company, which allows Defense Distributed to post the files once again after a years-long legal battle that spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations.\n\nDefense Distributed and its founder, Cody Wilson, argue that their right to move forward with the plans to post the files online falls under constitutionally-protected free speech.\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) stated, \"These guns are a menace. The failure to ban them will mean blood on the hands of officials who have that responsibility. I call on the Trump administration now to do the right thing.\"\n\nPresident Trump tweeted on Tuesday that he is looking into the issue and has spoken to the National Rifle Association about it. However, Sen. Blumenthal stated, \"He can blame it on anyone if he wants to save face, but it's his doing. It's his responsibility, and the blood's going to be on his hands. It's that simple and stark.\"\n\nThe senators and other Democrats in Congress are now pushing legislation aimed at blocking the company from posting the prints and looking to ban \"untraceable\" guns that don't have serial numbers or metal parts that can be crafted using 3D printers.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer predicted that nothing would come of President Trump's tweet, calling it \"a dollar short and a day late.\" Schumer stated, \"[As] sure as we're here today, nothing is going to happen from this administration.\" He added, \"We're going to have to pass legislation [because] they are just enslaved by the NRA.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stated last month's decision \"is a death warrant for countless innocent men, women, and children.\" Pelosi further added, \"This settlement makes clear that the GOP is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NRA.\"",
    " Title: Healthcare Exchanges Fail to Post Consumer Ratings, Leaving Consumers in the Dark\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the United States, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) has been met with technical issues and a lack of consumer ratings, leaving shoppers with limited information to make informed decisions about their health plans. The consumer ratings, called for in the Affordable Care Act, would be provided by an independent company, allowing consumers to judge health plans based on treatment outcomes, service, and consumer satisfaction.\n\nHowever, federal and state officials have not published these ratings, citing concerns that it would reflect poorly on the insurance exchanges if some companies were rated and others were not. This controversy arose last week in California, where three highly-rated providers, including Western Advantage, Kaiser Permanente, and Sharp Health Care, complained that the state failed to post their ratings due to opposition from lower-rated plans.\n\nGarry Maisel, CEO of Western Health Advantage, stated, \"When a quality rating is available, consumers should have access to it. If I was a consumer, I would want to know [if] the plan I pick, the network of providers I access care through, was just put together or has been around a long time.\"\n\nThe National Council on Quality Assurance (NCQA) rates almost every health plan available nationwide on treatment, prevention, and customer service. Each category is scored on a scale of 1 to 5, and plans are ranked from best to worst. Eighty percent of insurers nationwide are rated by the NCQA. However, only eight states are posting those ratings, with the rest, including the 34 state health care exchanges managed by the federal government, not posting them.\n\nBetsy McCaughey, a health care analyst, stated, \"To make a smart choice, we need more information, that is why this rating system is so important. Otherwise, choosing a plan on these exchanges is just a shot in the dark.\"\n\nSome states, like Colorado, Minnesota, and Oregon, do post ratings. The Oregon website lists the quality score right next to price, allowing for an apples-to-apples comparison. Maisel stated that it is a model other states should strive for.\n\n\"Value is a combination of price versus quality,\" he said. \"It's like an equation, like a teeter-totter. So put it out there! Price is out, so put the quality rating out there and let the consumer decide who they want to buy based on value.\"\n\nUnder the law, the health care exchanges have until 2016 to display quality-of-care data.",
    " Title: Tucker Carlson Questions Double Standard in FBI's Investigation of Alleged Hate Crimes\n\nArticle:\n\nTucker Carlson, host of Fox News Channel's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" opened his Tuesday program by questioning the double standard in the investigation of alleged hate crimes compared to other crimes. He pointed to the Department of Justice and FBI's investigation of the alleged hate crime at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama, contrasting it with the alleged crimes committed by the \"mob.\"\n\nCarlson argued that the apparent conclusion was that the \"mob\" was an arm of the Democratic Party's establishment. He questioned the authenticity of the noose incident involving NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace, citing the lack of evidence and the history of similar incidents being hoaxes.\n\nCarlson highlighted six high-profile alleged hate crimes involving nooses between 2015 and 2018, all of which turned out to be hoaxes. He also mentioned the case of Jussie Smollett, who was charged with staging a hate crime against himself.\n\nThe host questioned the FBI's response to the Bubba Wallace incident, with 15 agents investigating the alleged provocation, while mobs were reportedly roaming the country, burning property, and assaulting people with seemingly little law enforcement intervention.\n\nCarlson concluded that the FBI's response to the Bubba Wallace incident was a hoax, as there was no hate crime in Wallace's garage. He also questioned the FBI and Federal prosecutors' response to the vandalism of the statue of American patriot, Francis Scott Key, in San Francisco, where the words \"Kill the colonizers. Kill whitey\" were spray-painted.\n\nCarlson suggested that the double standard in the investigation of hate crimes and the response to the \"mob\" indicated that the \"mob\" was an arm of the Democratic establishment. He also pointed to the City of Philadelphia's Mayor and District Attorney, who allegedly supported the destruction of public property, while threatening to prosecute those trying to protect statues.",
    " Title: Justice Department Files Lawsuit Against Ferguson to Overhaul Police and Court Operations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against the city of Ferguson in an attempt to force a reformation of the city's troubled police and court operations. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced the decision on Wednesday, following a rejection by the Ferguson City Council of a consent decree that was previously agreed upon.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that local law enforcement conduct in Ferguson routinely violates the Constitution. The residents of Ferguson have been waiting nearly a year for an agreement that would protect their rights and ensure their safety, according to Lynch.\n\nThe city's troubles, which include a pattern and practice of racially biased policing, were highlighted by the August 2014 police shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown. The incident and subsequent protests led to a wide-ranging investigation by the Justice Department, which concluded nearly a year ago that the city's police and municipal court unfairly targeted African-American residents, who make up about 70% of the population.\n\nFerguson Mayor James Knowles and city council members raised concerns about the cost of implementing the tentative agreement, which they estimated could cost nearly $10 million over the next three years. The city has a budget of about $14 million and is facing about $2.8 million in debt due to police overtime during the unrest following Brown's death and lost tax revenue from businesses destroyed or badly damaged in rioting.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles stated, \"The ball is in their court. We're sitting and waiting to talk. If they want to threaten legal action, then that's what they're threatening.\"\n\nThe Justice Department's decision to file a lawsuit comes after city leaders sought to revise the settlement, citing prohibitive costs. However, the Justice Department maintains that there is no cost for constitutional policing.\n\nThe city of Ferguson has been at the center of a national discussion on police tactics and community relations, prompting the appointment of a special White House panel. In Ferguson, city leaders hosted a series of emotionally-charged hearings this month on whether to ratify the tentative Justice settlement. Some residents urged the City Council to reject the deal and take their chances in court, while others favored the agreement as a way for the city to regain the trust of a wary African-American community.\n\nWesley Bell, a Ferguson council member, said members of the council felt it was important to present their concerns about the costs of implementing the deal. He stated that the amendments to the agreement were not meant to be a \"take it or leave it\" offer.\n\n\"We hope the Justice Department is willing to sit down and talk to us and continue negotiations,\" Bell said. \"If this case goes to court, it will not be because of the city of Ferguson.\"\n\nProponents of the Justice agreement noted that fighting a legal battle could be costly and prove more expensive in the long-term than settling now. However, Mayor Knowles disputed this notion, stating that the city's analysis shows \"the agreement, as it currently stands, will cost more to implement than it would be to fight a lawsuit.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Troop Withdrawal from Afghanistan: A Look at the Prisoner Exchange and the Seven-Day Reduction in Violence Agreement\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent seven-day reduction in violence agreement between the United States and the Taliban has sparked discussions about the future of Afghanistan and the role of negotiators in such agreements. The deal, which may not guarantee lasting peace, has been met with mixed reactions, with some viewing it as a significant step towards ending American involvement in the war, while others criticize certain aspects of the agreement.\n\nOne contentious issue is the prisoner exchange, with experts noting that the Taliban has long demanded a large prisoner release before negotiations. The U.S. made this a precondition for the Afghan government and the Taliban to engage in talks, a move that has reportedly caused tension with the Afghan government, which is holding the Taliban prisoners.\n\nThe Trump administration has been criticized for not anticipating or managing this issue more effectively beforehand. However, the administration has argued that ending American involvement in the war is the right thing to do, especially given the difficult terrain and tribal complexities of Afghanistan, which have made it notoriously difficult to govern and conquer.\n\nPresident Trump has expressed his aversion to foreign military entanglements, and he has pledged to get the troops out. The politics of the moment should not obscure the fact that ending American involvement in the war is a decision that has been reached, with the seven-day reduction in violence agreement being a step towards this goal.\n\nComparisons have been drawn between the current administration's approach and that of former President Obama, who was criticized for releasing five Taliban detainees in exchange for a captured U.S. soldier, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, in 2014. In contrast, the Trump administration has agreed to the release of an estimated 5,000 Taliban prisoners.\n\nDespite the criticisms, some argue that the Trump administration has achieved in its first term what the Bush and Obama administrations were either unable or unwilling to do over two terms each. The seven-day reduction in violence agreement and the prisoner exchange are significant steps in the ongoing peace process, and it is hoped that they will lead to a more stable and peaceful Afghanistan. However, it is important to acknowledge that Afghanistan is still a long way from peace, and the road ahead is likely to be challenging.",
    " Title: Five Killed in Shooting at Annapolis Newspaper; Suspect Identified as Jarrod Ramos\n\nArticle:\n\nA shooting at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, on Thursday left at least five people dead and several others injured. The suspect, identified as Jarrod Ramos, 38, of Laurel, is believed to have had a long-running feud with the newspaper.\n\nAccording to authorities, Ramos fired through a glass door, looked for victims, and then sprayed the newsroom with gunfire. Acting police chief of the Anne Arundel County Police Department William Krampf confirmed that Capital Gazette assistant editor Rob Hiaasen, 59, was among the victims. Wendi Winters, 65, Rebecca Smith, 34, Gerald Fischman, 61, and John McNamara were also killed, he said. Smith was a sales assistant, and the others were journalists.\n\nKrampf stated, \"This was a targeted attack on the Capital Gazette. This person was prepared to shoot people. His intent was to cause harm.\" The suspect is currently in custody, but as of Thursday evening, he has not been booked.\n\nRamos is believed to have brought a defamation lawsuit against Eric Hartley, formerly a staff writer and columnist with The Capital, and Thomas Marquardt, then editor and publisher of The Capital, in 2012. In 2015, Maryland's second-highest court upheld a ruling in favor of the Capital Gazette and a former reporter who were accused by Ramos of defamation.\n\nPhil Davis, a Capital Gazette crime reporter, said he was hiding under his desk along with other newspaper employees when the shooter stopped firing. Davis told the Baltimore Sun, \"I don't know why he stopped.\"\n\nPolice are treating the shooting as a local incident, with no links to terrorism. Law enforcement officials are still investigating the motive behind the attack. When police found the suspect, his weapon was on the ground and \"not in his immediate proximity,\" according to Anne Arundel county executive Steve Schuh.\n\nCapital Gazette runs multiple newspapers out of its Annapolis office and includes one of the oldest newspapers in the United States, The Gazette, which traces its origins back to 1727. The company, part of the Tronc Inc media group, publishes newspapers in and around Annapolis, home of the U.S. Naval Academy. The papers have thrived by focusing on local news in the shadows of two much larger competitors, the Washington Post and Baltimore Sun.\n\nLaw enforcement in Baltimore and New York City have deployed extra officers to the offices of the New York Times and other major media outlets as a precaution. The shooting drew the attention of media groups, including Reporters Without Borders, which said it was deeply disturbed by the events in Annapolis.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has been briefed on the shooting, and White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said, \"My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Twitter, \"A violent attack on innocent journalists doing their job is an attack on every American.\"\n\nJimmy DeButts, an editor at the Capital Gazette, tweeted that he was devastated, heartbroken, and numb. \"I'm in no position to speak, just know @capgaznews reporters & editors give all they have every day. There are no 40-hour weeks, no big paydays - just a passion for telling stories from our community,\" he wrote.

He also suggests that the United States should not accept refugees from the Middle East without proper vetting, particularly young men.\n\nThe call comes in response to the Paris attacks, where it was confirmed that a Syrian refugee, who was registered in several European countries last month, was found near the body of one of the attackers.\n\nRomney emphasizes the need for American leadership in this war, stating that \"only America can lead this war, and that leadership means being willing to devote whatever resources are required to win \u2013 even boots on the ground.\" He criticizes Obama's assertion that the advance of the jihadists had been \"contained\" as proven wrong.\n\nRomney also calls for a clear and unambiguous identification of the enemy, stating that \"We will not defeat it if we are afraid to call it by its name.\" He differentiates between radical Islamists and the Islamic faith, stating that the Islamic State represents the greatest threat among branches of this ideology. Romney suggests that the broader Islamic world will play a critical role in this war.",
    " Title: Democrats Consider Trade of Bidens for Bolton in Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, there is a potential shift in strategy among some Democrats, as they consider trading the testimony of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, for that of former National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n\nAccording to a report by The Washington Post, Democrats are now seriously contemplating this trade-off, with the aim of hearing from their desired witnesses, such as Bolton. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, has previously stated that he would find it \"fine\" for Hunter Biden to testify, as Democrats \"take the position that we want to hear from the witnesses.\"\n\nHowever, the political implications of this move are uncertain. Democrats believe that calling either Biden could potentially harm Trump and the Republican Party, providing a platform for the Bidens to counterattack and portray Republicans as overly focused on damaging a 2020 presidential rival.\n\nYet, this strategy may not be advantageous for Democrats. Trump has thus far managed to survive numerous attempts to remove him from office, and his presidency remains intact. Moreover, the Bidens may face significant challenges in a Senate hearing, given Hunter Biden's past admissions of his role at Burisma and the public's unfavorable perception of his actions.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the presence of Joe Biden in the Senate chamber could potentially lead to internal conflicts among the Democratic candidates, as they vie for the party's nomination. With some candidates already publicly criticizing Hunter Biden's role in Burisma, a Senate trial could provide additional opportunities for attacks on the frontrunner.\n\nUltimately, the decision to call either Biden or Bolton may not significantly alter the course of the impeachment trial, as both parties are likely to face political risks. The public's sentiment regarding impeachment is already largely set, and John Bolton is expected to corroborate the existing evidence against Trump.\n\nS.E. Cupp, the host of \"S.E. Cupp Unfiltered\" on CNN, suggests that Democrats should avoid involving the Bidens in the impeachment trial and accept that Trump's downfall may ultimately be self-inflicted.",
    " Title: California Voters Approve Sentence Reduction for Some Prisoners, Reject Abolition of Death Penalty\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia voters have approved a ballot initiative that alters the state's three-strikes law, potentially making thousands of prisoners eligible for sentence reductions. However, a proposition to abolish the death penalty in the state was rejected.\n\nThe approved initiative modifies the three-strikes law by eliminating the mandatory 25-years-to-life sentence for a third felony if the crime is nonviolent. As many as 3,000 prisoners could appeal their original sentences due to this change, a concern for the author of the original three-strikes law, Mike Reynolds.\n\nOn the other hand, the proposition to replace the death penalty with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was rejected. Mark Klass, the father of Polly Klass, a 12-year-old girl murdered in 1993, expressed relief that the man convicted of the crime will remain on death row.\n\nMore than 700 inmates are currently on California's death row, and 14 of them have exhausted all legal appeals. It remains unclear when executions will resume in California.\n\nFormer Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti, who had joined with the ACLU and a former head warden of San Quentin prison to try to abolish the state's death penalty, argues that the death penalty does not serve as a crime deterrent. He also points out that the state has spent $4 billion to house death row inmates and pay for their appeals.\n\nWhile Californians rejected Proposition 34, they did vote to change the state's three-strikes law. Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley argues that repeat offenders will still have to serve time, but their sentences will be proportionate to the crime committed. He claims this practice has been successful in reducing crime rates in Los Angeles County for the past 12 years.\n\nAdam Gelb, director of the Public Safety Performance Project at the Pew Center on the States, notes that California previously had the nation's harshest three-strikes law. He suggests that the vote to revise it indicates a growing tiredness among voters of spending money on nonviolent offenders serving long prison sentences. Gelb also suggests that this could lead to other states reforming their three-strikes laws.",

In 2004, Zarqawi was responsible for the televised beheadings, starting with the killing of American businessman Nick Berg, and ignited a civil war against the Shiites in Iraq the same year. These tactics and policies remain at the core of ISIS today.\n\nThe opportunity for Zarqawi to create al Qaeda in Iraq was provided by George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi dictator, brutally suppressed all opposition to his regime, and before the Iraq War, al Qaeda had no presence in Iraq. Al Qaeda in Iraq grew in strength in 2006, controlling much of the massive Anbar province in western Iraq, before being largely extirpated by U.S. troops in 2008.\n\nHowever, al Qaeda in Iraq surged back as ISIS due to four significant factors. The first was the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011 in response to President Bashar al-Assad's brutal repression of peaceful protests against his dictatorship. Elements of what would become ISIS traveled from Iraq into Syria to fight against Assad, gaining strength in Syria, which they drew upon when they re-entered Iraq as a reinvigorated force in 2013, seizing much of Anbar a year later as well as Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq.\n\nThe second factor was the role that some of Hussein's former officer corps played in helping ISIS to its victories. A number of the late dictator's former commanders helped to professionalize ISIS as a fighting force. The Bush administration's decision to disband the Iraqi army in 2003 had helped push some Iraqi officers to join Sunni militant groups.\n\nThe third factor was the feckless and incompetent rule of then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who marginalized Sunnis and disenfranchised them from Iraq's political process to the point that many Sunnis preferred the rule of the Islamist militants in ISIS to that of the \"Shia\" government in Baghdad. Inexplicably, the Obama White House kept backing Maliki despite his manifest flaws as a leader.\n\nThe fourth factor was the hollowing out of the Iraqi army, which simply ran away as ISIS made its most dramatic advances during the first half of 2014. The Iraqi army was poorly led, poorly paid, and riven with corruption.\n\nNone of these factors can be easily ascribed to Obama or Clinton, although they did preside over the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, a plan bequeathed to them by Bush. Could the Obama administration have fought harder to retain a U.S. troop presence in Iraq? Possibly. Would the Iraqi government have allowed such a presence? Not likely, as the Iraq government was by the time of the U.S. withdrawal more aligned with Iran than with the United States.\n\nObama was also slow to recognize the threat posised by ISIS, famously referring to the Islamist terrorist group gaining ground in Syria and Iraq as a \"JV\" team in a January 2014 interview. Since the summer of 2014, the Obama administration has mounted an aggressive campaign against ISIS, but it has proven reluctant to do much on the ground. Could more be done? Yes. More U.S. Special Forces fighting side by side with Iraqi forces and more U.S. forward air controllers calling in close air support would certainly help the Iraqi military against ISIS.\n\nIn Syria, a no-fly zone targeted at Assad's air force and safe zones for refugees fleeing the fighting would help tamp down the death toll that plays into the hands of ISIS and other Sunni militants who can position themselves as the only groups that are really defending the Sunni population.\n\nRather than making loose and unsubstantiated claims that Obama and Clinton created ISIS, it would behoove Trump if he advanced some real policy ideas about how to solve the Syrian and Iraqi civil wars. Of course, to do that he would have to get beyond the inflammatory slogans and sound bites that have characterized his campaign.",
    " Title: Trump's Tax-Cut Proposals Shift Focus Away from Fiscal Discipline\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump's new tax-cut proposals have sparked a debate over the nation's fiscal discipline as the focus shifts towards tax cuts and away from tax reform that would maintain revenue levels. The proposals, which include slashing corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 15 percent and individual tax cuts, mark a shift in the Trump administration's approach to fiscal policy.\n\nThis shift is not unique to the Trump team, according to fiscal-policy experts. Politicians and their advisors are reportedly less focused on restraining government debt and deficits compared to previous eras. However, this does not mean that the goal of fiscal discipline has been completely disregarded, as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged the need for fiscal discipline during Wednesday's announcement of the tax-cut goals and principles.\n\nThe economic implications of the tax cuts are a subject of debate among economists. While some argue that fiscal stimulus can provide a short-term boost to the economy, others are skeptical that Trump's tax cuts would significantly increase growth.\n\nHistorically, the United States has seen a surge in federal deficits during and after economic downturns, but deficits have since fallen sharply and are now near their five-decade average as a share of the US economy. However, even without tax cuts, the annual gap between revenue and spending is expected to rise again, potentially driving a parallel surge in public debt in the coming decades due to rising obligations for health-care entitlements and interest on the debt.\n\nThe shift in fiscal policy is not solely a political issue, but also reflects a change in economic thought, with some liberal economists arguing that fiscal stimulus may be justifiable in some non-recession times. However, the long-term consequences of this shift in fiscal policy remain a topic of debate among economists and the public.\n\nWhile the legislative outlook is uncertain, some experts are hopeful that forces of fiscal restraint will revive in the future. Bill White, a former Houston mayor and author of a book on America's fiscal history, believes that a backlash among small-government conservatives and a growing understanding among Democrats of the dangers of rising interest costs could lead to a renewed focus on fiscal discipline.",
    " Title: Tillerson Hails \"Historic Moment\" in U.S.-Saudi Relations During Joint Address with Saudi Foreign Minister\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson and Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir emphasized strategic and economic partnerships during a joint address in Riyadh on Saturday, May 20, 2017. Tillerson described the occasion as a \"historic moment\" in U.S.-Saudi relations.\n\nAccompanied by President Donald Trump on his first foreign trip as commander in chief, Tillerson referenced multiple potential threats facing the two countries. He highlighted the development of a new center for combating extremist ideology, to be based in Riyadh, and the need to defeat ISIS not only on the battlefield but also in the cyberspace.\n\nThe new defense deal, which includes upgrades to Saudi communications, missile defense, maritime, border, and cyber security, is expected to lower the demands on the U.S. military and strengthen Saudi security forces for the future. Tillerson stated that the arms sales package would reduce the burden on the U.S. to provide the same equipment to its own military forces.\n\nTillerson also discussed other Middle Eastern countries with high levels of conflict, including Yemen, where he suggested a \"political\" solution is needed and that it's \"important to put pressure on parties to come to the table and talk.\"\n\nOn Iran, Tillerson stated that the U.S. is closely coordinating its efforts to counter Iran's extremism, particularly its support for foreign fighters, foreign fighter payments, and militia operating in Yemen, Iraq, and Syria. He mentioned the possibility of a conversation with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in the future, though no plans are set.\n\nTillerson also addressed the economic benefits of Saudi Arabia's direct investment in the U.S., stating that it would bring \"hundreds of thousands\" of jobs to American workers. Earlier, Trump described the investments as \"hundreds of billions\" for the U.S. and jobs for its citizens.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Al-Jubeir called for a change in the conversation in the U.S. and the broader Western world to \"one of partnership,\" while directly quoting Trump's rhetoric. He stated that the partnership would \"truly change our world, and we will have truly drowned the voices of extremism, and we will have drained the swamp from which extremism and terrorism emanates.\"",
    " Title: Senate Nuclear Option Threatened as Republicans Block Nominees\n\nArticle:\n\nThe \"nuclear option\" has resurfaced in the United States Senate following the Republican party's blocking of two of President Barack Obama's nominations to both the executive and judicial branches. The votes, which took place on Thursday, have reignited discussions about changing the Senate's rules to allow nominations to pass with a simple majority, rather than the current 60-vote threshold for procedural votes.\n\nThe Senate voted 56-42 to block Rep. Mel Watt's (D-NC) nomination to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and Patricia Millett's nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals was stopped in a 55-38 vote.\n\nSenate Democrats, who have long advocated for rules changes to allow for simple majority votes on nominees, view Thursday's votes as another reason to eliminate the 60-vote threshold. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) stated, \"Support is growing for changing the rules when they play these games.\"\n\nSen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) commented, \"The pattern of 'obstruct and delay' has returned as the norm in the U.S. Senate with today's filibuster of two highly qualified nominees.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has stated he will file cloture on two additional D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals nominees before deciding whether to invoke the nuclear option again. Reid and No. 3 Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have pledged to reconsider the Watt and Millett nominations \"at some point in the very near future.\"\n\nHowever, some Democrats, including Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), believe the Senate should eliminate the filibuster on nominees as soon as possible. Merkley has long advocated for limiting the minority's power.\n\nThe GOP blocked Watt's nomination because they saw him as a political pick, rather than a housing policy expert. Republicans objected to Millett because they believe the court has a minimal workload and are concerned that Obama is trying to stack the 11-seat bench ideologically. They contend that Senate Democrats made similar arguments when President George W. Bush was trying to get his judges confirmed.\n\nThe Senate is expected to recess for a long weekend, leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of many Democrats. Vice President Joe Biden, who was on Capitol Hill to swear in Cory Booker as New Jersey's new Democratic senator, called the vote on Watt a \"gigantic disappointment.\"",
    " Title: Colorado Voters' Support for Recreational Marijuana Law Increases, but Majority Views It as Harmful to State's Image\n\nArticle:\n\nA new survey conducted by Quinnipiac University indicates that slightly more Colorado voters support the state's new recreational marijuana law compared to six months ago. The poll, which was conducted from January 29 to February 2, interviewed 1,139 registered voters in Colorado by telephone. The overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.\n\nThe new recreational marijuana law, which went into effect on January 1, now has the support of 58% of voters, up from 54% in August. However, the margin of 4 percentage points falls within the survey's sampling error.\n\nThe poll also reveals that a majority of Colorado voters, 51%, consider the law as harmful to the state's image, compared to 38% who disagree and 10% who are unsure or do not have an opinion.\n\nBreaking down the numbers by demographics, 39% of Republicans support the new law, while 76% of Democrats and 55% of independents favor it. The law is more popular among those in the 18-29 age group, with 78% in support. The number drops as the age increases, with only 33% of those 65 or older supporting the law.\n\nWhile support seems to be trending upwards, the survey also shows that 51% of Colorado voters have tried marijuana previously, but only 10% say they have used marijuana since it became legal last month.\n\nThe current law allows Coloradans to grow up to a dozen marijuana plants in their homes. The survey found that more than seven in ten (71%) say they would not be bothered if one of their neighbors was growing marijuana.\n\nIn terms of edibles, only 17% say it is very or somewhat likely they would try marijuana brownies at a gathering. Eighty-one percent would be somewhat or very uncomfortable riding in a car with a driver who has had moderate amounts of marijuana.\n\nThe survey also asked about the likelihood of trying marijuana brownies at a gathering. Only 17% say it is very or somewhat likely they would try marijuana brownies at a gathering. Eighty-one percent would be somewhat or very uncomfortable riding in a car with a driver who has had moderate amounts of marijuana.",
    " Title: Former President Bill Clinton Calls for Supreme Court to Overturn Defense of Marriage Act\n\n Article:\n\n In a recent op-ed published by The Washington Post, former President Bill Clinton has called on the Supreme Court to rule the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional. The law, signed into law by Clinton in 1996, defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman, denying federal benefits to same-sex couples in the nine states where same-sex couples can legally wed.\n\n In the op-ed, Clinton wrote, \"On March 27, DOMA will come before the Supreme Court and the justices must decide whether it is consistent with the principles of a nation that honors freedom, equality, and justice above all, and is therefore constitutional.\" He continued, \"As the president who signed the act into law, I have come to believe that DOMA is contrary to those principles and, in fact, incompatible with our Constitution.\"\n\n When it was first enacted, Clinton wrote, \"it was a very different time.\" He added that many supporters of the bill believed its passage would \"defuse a movement to enact a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, which would have ended the debate for a generation or more.\"\n\n Under those circumstances, he wrote, the bill came to his desk, opposed by 81 out of 535 members of Congress. Fast forward to 2013, and the climate is much different. Nine states (plus the District of Columbia) have passed laws allowing same-sex marriage, and public opinion polls show a majority of Americans think it should be legal. According to a CBS News poll conducted last month, 54% of Americans think same-sex couples should have the right to legally wed, while 39% oppose same-sex marriage.\n\n Looking back, Clinton said he had hoped DOMA would not provide an excuse for discrimination. \"I know now that, even worse than providing an excuse for discrimination, the law is itself discriminatory,\" he wrote. \"It should be overturned.\"\n\n Same-sex couples who are legally married in the United States are still denied \"more than a thousand federal statutes and programs available to other married couples\" because of the law, he wrote.\n\n While he previously opposed same-sex marriage, Clinton went public in 2009 with a change of heart. \"I was against the constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage nationwide, and I still think that the American people should be able to play this out in debates,\" Clinton told CNN's Anderson Cooper in September 2009. \"But me, Bill Clinton personally, I changed my position.\"\n\n \"I am no longer opposed to that,\" he added. \"I think if people want to make commitments that last a lifetime, they ought to be able to do it.\"\n\n In his op-ed, Clinton wrote that \"while our laws may at times lag behind our best natures, in the end they catch up to our core values.\"\n\n \"I join with the Obama administration, the petitioner Edith Windsor, and the many other dedicated men and women who have engaged in this struggle for decades in urging the Supreme Court to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act,\" he wrote.",
    " Title: White House Officials Criticize Netanyahu for Accepting Congress Invitation, Citing Disrespect Toward Obama Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nWhite House officials have expressed disapproval towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for accepting House Speaker John Boehner's invitation to address Congress in March. According to unnamed senior U.S. officials, Netanyahu's decision was perceived as a direct challenge to President Barack Obama, with one official describing it as a \"spit in our face.\"\n\nThe planned speech before Congress is expected to see Netanyahu urging lawmakers to impose tougher sanctions on Iran to halt its suspect nuclear program, as reported by The Times of Israel and Haaretz. Last week, Obama reportedly personally requested Netanyahu to tone down his support for new sanctions legislation, a measure Obama has pledged to veto.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Netanyahu's apparent disregard for U.S. leadership was particularly offensive to Secretary of State John Kerry, who has made numerous efforts on Israel's behalf on the world stage over the past month. This includes dozens of calls to world leaders to oppose a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have set a time frame for the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nIn response to Kerry's criticism of Netanyahu's stance on new sanctions, Israel's intelligence chief, Tamir Pardo, has denied contradicting his boss during a January meeting with U.S. officials. Pardo stated that he reiterated the need for \"firm pressure\" to bring about meaningful compromises from the Iranian side, rather than the reported \"throwing a grenade into the process.\"",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader McConnell Calls for Senate Intelligence Committee to Investigate Russian Election Interference\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has called for the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate recent findings that the Russian government attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election. In a statement on Monday, McConnell described the allegations of Russian meddling as \"disturbing.\"\n\nMcConnell suggested that the Intelligence Committee is capable of conducting a comprehensive review of the matter, dismissing calls for a special select committee to investigate the issue. When asked about the possibility of a special bipartisan commission, McConnell indicated that the Senate would follow \"regular order\" and review the matter on a bipartisan basis.\n\nMcConnell sits on the Intelligence Committee as an ex-officio member, and incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer (N.Y.) will soon join him in the same capacity. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a leading Senate voice on national security and the threat posed by Russia, has also called for a special committee to delve into the issue.\n\nMcConnell noted that McCain and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, will both be looking at the issue and doing so on a bipartisan basis. McConnell declined to comment on the possible appointment of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who has close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, to serve as Secretary of State.\n\nWhile McConnell strongly condemned allegations that Russia may have breached U.S. \"cybersecurity measures,\" he cautioned against taking leaked characterizations of the motivation behind Russian hacking at face value, suggesting a possible partisan lens. McConnell noted that prior to the election, the director of National Intelligence released a statement about hacking activities directed by the Russian government, but cautioned that any leaks about U.S. intelligence findings \"is irresponsible, likely illegal, and potentially for partisan political gain.\"\n\nJason Miller, a spokesman for President-elect Donald Trump, dismissed efforts to investigate Russian interference in the election as coming from \"people who are bitter their candidate lost.\" Trump has dismissed the CIA report, calling it \"ridiculous\" on Sunday and following up on Twitter on Monday.",
    " Title: Historical Ignorance and Political Polarization: A Reflection on Trump's Speech in Poland\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring President Trump's speech in Warsaw, Poland, on Thursday, he paid tribute to Pope John Paul II's historic 1979 visit to the city. Many historians attribute the Pope's Mass in Victory Square as a pivotal event that set in motion the events leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nDuring the speech, President Trump referenced the millions of Poles who attended the Mass, stating, \"They did not ask for wealth. They did not ask for privilege. Instead, one million Poles sang three simple words: 'We want God.'\" However, some viewers and Twitter users assumed the President was making unfounded statements or speaking irrationally.\n\nThis response is understandable, given President Trump's reputation for making controversial statements. Yet, it is a reminder of the widespread political and ideological polarization that exists today. The instantaneity of television and social media platforms like Twitter only amplifies this problem.\n\nIgnorance, being the absence of knowledge, is a common human foible. It is a vacuum that, when filled with assumptions and misinformation, can lead to misunderstandings and polarization. As historian Daniel Boorstin once noted, \"The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge.\"\n\nThe instantaneity of television and social media platforms only amplifies the problem. For instance, on the Fourth of July, NPR's Morning Edition tweeted out the text of the Declaration of Independence, 140 characters at a time. The angry responses, from both the Left and Right, were a spectacle to behold.\n\nWorld War II and the Cold War, particularly Vietnam, used to define the intellectual framework for understanding many events. For people in their 30s, that framework changed to the Iraq War and the War on Terror. In my more curmudgeonly moments, it seems like the new paradigm for Millennials (and the journalists and politicians who pander to them) isn't some major geopolitical test or moment but the adventures of Harry Potter.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that a children's book about a magical boarding school for wizards is of limited utility in understanding the world. In my more curmudgeonly moments, it seems like the new paradigm for Millennials (and the journalists and politicians who pander to them) isn't some major geopolitical test or moment but the adventures of Harry Potter.\n\nToday, we face a multitude of challenges, at home and abroad, that can only be met by people with a modicum of historical literacy. If only Harry Potter could cast a spell to give it to us.",
    " Title: Nuclear Option and Medicare: A Tightly Linked Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent invocation of the \"nuclear option\" by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, which permanently prohibits filibustering judicial and executive branch nominees (excluding Supreme Court nominees), has sparked a debate among political pundits, particularly those concerned with fiscal issues and healthcare costs. This debate, while seemingly unrelated, is actually closely linked, as these fiscal hawks owe Reid a significant debt of gratitude for his actions.\n\nIn an interview with NewsmaxTV, Time magazine's Mark Halperin inadvertently exposed the tension between these two issues. Halperin, in discussing the nation's healthcare spending, suggested that rationing end-of-life care is necessary due to the high cost of such care. However, his comments sparked controversy when they seemed to confirm the \"death panel\" narrative.\n\nHalperin later clarified that he was referring to the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a cost-cutting panel created by the Affordable Care Act to cap Medicare spending growth. IPAB, if fully staffed and operational, would be tasked with cutting payments to healthcare providers to keep spending at a manageable level, creating an incentive for providers to allocate resources wisely.\n\nThe contradiction lies in the fact that Republicans, who are currently blocking IPAB nominations, would likely have nullified the panel altogether if Reid had not invoked the nuclear option. Without IPAB, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would have to act as a cost-cutting board, a role that would be more vulnerable to politicization and abolition by Congress than a fully staffed IPAB.\n\nIf one cares about how the country spends its healthcare dollars, as Halperin claims, Reid's decision to go nuclear is of significant consequence. The IPAB can be overridden by Congress, but only by replacing its recommendations with equivalent savings. If Congress chooses to abolish IPAB altogether, it will have to address how to finance the higher relative health spending it will create.\n\nRepublicans, and some Democratic IPAB opponents, characterize it as a rationing board. Most of them avoid \"death panel\" rhetoric. However, the question for them, once IPAB is up and running, will be who should be rationing these dollars instead. Should insurers do it, while pocketing a profit?\n\nIn conclusion, the nuclear option's impact on the functioning of Washington, as Halperin suggests, is a matter of perspective. While some view it as a partisan power grab, others see it as a necessary step to address the nation's fiscal health and healthcare spending. The honest, straightforward discussion Halperin called for may indeed be on the horizon, thanks to Reid's decision to invoke the nuclear option.",
    " Title: President Trump Announces Permanent Residency Change to Florida\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tweet on Thursday evening, President Donald Trump announced that he and his family have changed their permanent residency status to Florida. The President stated that he will continue to reside at the White House during a potential second term, but his new home will be Palm Beach, Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago Club is located.\n\nTrump expressed his affection for the White House, stating, \"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, is the place I have come to love and will stay for, hopefully, another 5 years as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\" However, he cited his treatment by New York City and state political leaders as the reason for his decision to change his permanent residence.\n\nThe President stated, \"I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state, and local taxes each year, I have been treated very poorly by the political leaders of both the city and state.\" He added, \"I hated having to make this decision, but in the end, it will be best for all concerned.\"\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio responded to the news with tweets. Cuomo wrote, \"He\u2019s all yours, Florida,\" while de Blasio tweeted, \"Don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out or whatever.\"\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a potential Democratic presidential candidate, accused Trump of making the move to hide tax information from New York authorities.

    " Title: Dr. Ben Carson Forms Exploratory Committee for 2016 Presidential Run\n\nArticle:\n\nDr. Ben Carson, a renowned neurosurgeon, has announced the formation of an exploratory committee to consider a potential run for the 2016 presidential election. In a video released alongside the announcement, Carson expressed his dissatisfaction with the current state of political leadership in Washington and his desire to bring common-sense solutions to the table.\n\nCarson's potential candidacy positions him as an anti-establishment, non-traditional candidate, aiming to appeal to voters who are disillusioned with the political status quo. He has already garnered a strong following due to his professional achievements and public speaking abilities.\n\nHowever, some political analysts question whether Carson would be better suited for a Senate seat, given the upcoming vacancy of longtime Sen. Barbara Mikulski's (D-MD) seat in 2016. Jonah Goldberg, a conservative political commentator, suggests that Carson might have a greater impact on the national political landscape as a senatorial candidate. Goldberg argues that Carson could potentially flip a safe Democratic seat in the tough 2016 election year for Republicans, given his national appeal and the potential for rolling over his presidential campaign funds.\n\nDespite these speculations, Carson has indicated that a Senate run has not crossed his mind, as his announcement today seems to confirm. It appears that a Senate bid is not part of his current political plans.\n\nIt is worth noting that Dr. Carson has no prior political office experience, which may impact his chances of winning the 2016 nomination. However, several candidates have run for a U.S. Senate without prior government service and have been successful. Elizabeth Warren, for example, defeated incumbent Sen. Scott Brown (R-MA) just three years ago and is now considered a serious contender for the 2016 presidential race by progressive circles.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Ben Carson's decision to form an exploratory committee for a potential 2016 presidential run signals his intent to challenge the political establishment. While his lack of political experience may pose a challenge, history has shown that candidates without prior government service can still achieve political success.",
    " Title: CNN Interview: Kellyanne Conway and Brianna Keilar Clash Over Trump's Remarks on Hillary Clinton and Paul Ryan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated interview on CNN's The Situation Room, CNN host Brianna Keilar grilled Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway over the Republican presidential candidate's repeated statements about sending Hillary Clinton to \"jail\" if he becomes president.\n\nDuring the nearly 30-minute interview on Wednesday, Conway attempted to downplay Trump's comments as a \"quip,\" but the candidate's remarks at a Florida rally on Wednesday seemed to contradict that assertion. \"She has to go to jail!\" Trump declared to cheers from his supporters.\n\nWhen confronted by Keilar about those remarks, Conway again repeated her \"quip\" line before quickly pivoting to an attack on Clinton for \"imperiling our national security.\" As Keilar continued to press Conway to explain why Trump insists on talking about \"jailing your political opponent,\" the campaign manager stopped her.\n\n\"You're taking it literally,\" Conway said. \"You're stuck on this one thing.\"\n\n\"I'm talking about what your candidate is saying, which is more important than what you are saying about this,\" Keilar responded. \"He is saying she has to go to jail. He is not talking about she has to stand and be judged. He is saying she has to go to jail.\"\n\nConway attempted to use her rhetorical gymnastics to escape the question, listing off some of things Clinton has said about Trump, but Keilar kept hammering her. \"He is saying, if he were president, she would be in jail,\" the host said.\n\nLater in the interview, Keilar also did not let Conway get away with denying that Trump has been \"attacking\" House Speaker Paul Ryan after the Republican leader said he would no longer defend the candidate. \"Come on, Kellyanne, he tweeted repeatedly. He called him weak and ineffective. So I mean, you want to give him credit for not attacking him at one rally?\" she asked. \"Is he done attacking the House Speaker then?\"\n\nAs the interview progressed, Conway resorted to attacking CNN for ignoring the \"substance\" of Trump's campaign. \"You're doing a disservice to the American people by not telling them exactly everything, fully and fairly, of what one of the presidential candidates actually the only one who goes out and talks to voters on a daily basis about issues,\" she said.\n\nMiraculously, despite the tension and animosity between the two women, Conway stuck around during a commercial break, something she may have regretted when Keilar opened the next segment with accusations from a former Miss Arizona who accused Trump of walking in on her changing backstage before one of his pageants, something Trump himself bragged about doing on The Howard Stern Show.\n\n\"I can't comment on what she is saying because I am not her and I was not in the pageant or any other pageant,\" Conway said. Like Trump, she tried to shift the conversation to Bill Clinton.\n\n\"The fact is that all you want to do, it seems, is talk about something he said ten, 15 years ago and, yet, we never ever want to talk, particularly CNN, where we offered up these women to you,\" Conway said, referring to the pre-debate press conference Trump held, flanked by women who had accused the former president of sexual assault and harassment. \"We never want to talk to the women shamed and blamed by Hillary Clinton because they had sexual contact with her husband.\"\n\n\"Maybe you want to ask me who it is I see day by day, this intelligent, clever, gracious, gentleman, frankly, whose family is making a huge sacrifice to run for president,\" Conway said, entering full-on rant mode. \"Nobody wants to talk about that. You want me to comment on something he said to Howard Stern in 15 seconds ten years ago and somehow I am an expert on it. I want to see the CNN poll that shows Americans want to focus on that, I truly do.\"\n\nAs Conway urged more serious discussion about issues facing Americans, Keilar pushed back. \"When does Donald Trump stop saying things like Hillary Clinton has to go to jail? He brings these things up himself,\" she said. \"You're saying this should be discussed. Why doesn't he make a pivot? Why doesn't he talk more seriously as a candidate about the issues and not upstage himself?\"\n\nConway's stated desire to focus on issues that Americans care about as opposed to decades-old comments and behavior flies directly in the face of a new report from Bloomberg Businessweek that says the Trump campaign will go all in on accusations made by women against Bill Clinton. That plan, spearheaded by campaign CEO Steve Bannon and others, aims not only to distract from Trump's own apparent history of sexual misconduct but also to depress the vote of millennial women. \"We\u2019re going to turn him into Bill Cosby,\" Bannon reportedly told Trump staffers.\n\nBy the end of the CNN interview, they had reached an impasse, and all Keilar could do was thank Conway for being \"generous\" with her time. \"Nice to be here,\" Conway replied, though it was unclear whether there was any more truth to that than to her insistence that Trump doesn't really want to jail his opponent.",
    " Title: Attorney General Loretta Lynch Faces Challenges in Improving Police-Community Relations Amid Baltimore Riots\n\nArticle:\n\nThe confirmation of Loretta Lynch as the 83rd Attorney General of the United States was delayed for an unprecedented 167 days, sparking speculation that Time, the inexorable force governing our universe, may hold a grudge against her. The delay was initiated by the Senate, but the subsequent riots in Baltimore have raised questions about the timeliness of Lynch's stated goal of improving police morale.\n\nThe unrest in Baltimore, which paralyzed the city this weekend, has been linked to the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American man who sustained a broken neck while in police custody. The circumstances surrounding Gray's death remain unclear, with reports suggesting he may have been beaten during transport, but an autopsy showing no other injuries. The Baltimore Police Department (BPD) has admitted to failing to provide Gray with necessary medical care, but the cause of his injuries remains undetermined.\n\nThe BPD's history of lawless violence has been identified as the catalyst for the riots. The widespread practice of giving \"a rough ride\" is a leading suspect in Gray's case, but the exact cause remains unknown. The fact that such incidents can occur and only become major stories after activism from peaceful protesters and the destructive actions of violent rioters is a concern.\n\nThe BPD's reputation, with many Baltimore residents hearing Gray's story with weary outrage rather than shock or indignation, is a significant issue. The fact that the BPD rank-and-file feels comfortable with extralegal brutality and are accustomed to wielding it, demands accountability, and leaves them panicking, is a problem.\n\nAttorney General Lynch's interest in finding common ground between law enforcement and minority communities has been noted, but the current situation in Baltimore and similar cities may require more than dialogue. What is needed instead are actions demonstrating a commitment to addressing police brutality, ending police militarization, and ensuring accountability for officers involved in such incidents.\n\nThe authorities in Baltimore, Maryland, and D.C. must stop pandering to police unions and instead take fears of the rise of the \"warrior cop\" seriously. The deaths of individuals like Freddie Gray should not be seen as \"tragic\" but as crimes. Suspending officers involved in such incidents is not enough; Lynch must make clear that she understands this and that her predecessor's groundbreaking report on Ferguson, Missouri, was no aberration.\n\nWhat is needed, in short, is for the people most apt to use \"the language of the unheard\" to feel that someone who matters is finally listening. And that those in public office prove with actions that they believe an African-American life is worth no less than a cop's. Now is not the time for Lynch to focus on making law enforcement happy. Now is the time for her to promote equal justice. Improving police morale can wait.",
    " Title: Grassroots Activists Express Disappointment with Republican Handling of Obamacare Repeal\n\nArticle:\n\nJenny Beth Martin, president and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, has stated that the group's email blasts against the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, still receive hundreds of responses from activists who are angry about it. The group made over 100,000 phone calls in a 48-hour period when the House was voting on its bill in early May to repeal and replace the healthcare law.\n\nHowever, Martin clarified that the group is not yet in support of what the Senate is doing regarding the repeal. Grassroots activists, such as Pat Daugherty, who once marched on Washington against Obamacare, now express similar levels of frustration with Republicans in Congress as they did during the early days of the Tea Party movement.\n\nDaugherty, a retired university administrator in Athens, Ga., stated, \"Every Republican in Congress ran on repealing Obamacare.\" She questioned why it is now difficult for Republicans to repeal Obamacare when they are in the majority. Daugherty added, \"I know a lot of conservatives who are more upset with Republicans than with Democrats.\"\n\nDavid Zupan, who organized Tea Party groups in Ohio against the Affordable Care Act, attributed the law to rising healthcare costs and the closure of his technology support business. Before the law, he paid $910 per month to insure himself and his wife with a $750 annual deductible. When he renewed his policy last year, he said, the rates had increased to $2,845 per month with a $3,500 deductible.\n\nZupan had hoped to confront Senator Rob Portman to demand a full repeal, but he gave up after being unable to locate Portman during the recess. Portman has expressed concern that the Senate bill would roll back Medicaid too far, particularly jeopardizing treatment for opioid addiction.\n\nZupan expressed his dissatisfaction with the current state of the bill, stating, \"Nothing they're going to do to this bill is going to make it better.\"",
    " Title: Whistleblower's Democratic Ties and Potential Bias Alleged in Ukraine Scandal\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican National Committee's Rapid Response Director, Steve Guest, has accused the mainstream media of disregarding evidence suggesting that the whistleblower who sparked the House investigation into President Donald Trump's phone conversation about U.S. aid to Ukraine is a Democratic operative. Guest stated, \"The silence is deafening,\" in an interview on Thursday.\n\nAccording to Guest, the whistleblower has a professional tie to a 2020 Democratic candidate, coordinated and took guidance from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's staff. Schiff, in turn, allegedly lied about this and his staff recommended attorneys for the whistleblower.\n\nFurthermore, Guest claims that the whistleblower's lawyers have worked for former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and donated to Joe Biden's presidential campaign. One of the whistleblower's attorneys is also reportedly a member of the #Resistance, an anti-Trump movement.\n\nHowever, the Washington Examiner reported on August 26 that Inspector General Michael Atkinson, in a letter to the whistleblower, acknowledged some indicia of an arguable political bias in favor of a rival political candidate. The Examiner also reported that the whistleblower had a significant tie to one of the Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nLawyers for the whistleblower, Mark Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, have denied these allegations of bias. They stated that their client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party. They also clarified that their client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials, not as candidates.\n\nMark Zaid, a lawyer for the whistleblower, has a history of anti-Trump sentiment. In a podcast last year, he stated, \"I'm not a Trump fan. I go out of my way on Twitter to say '#Resistance.' It's not a resistance against the GOP or a Republican -- I do not think [Trump] is a Republican, quite frankly.\"\n\nMeanwhile, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is facing criticism over a September meeting his staff apparently had with the whistleblower. When Schiff was questioned about this meeting in September, he stated that his committee had not spoken directly with the whistleblower. However, The New York Times reported that a House Intelligence Committee aide did have contact with the whistleblower, contact that Trump has argued was illegal.\n\nThe GOP's Guest also told the media that he believes the Democrats' impeachment push is a coordinated political smear reminiscent of the Russia hoax and the phony Brett Kavanaugh allegations.",
    " Title: Obama Campaign Strategy Shifts Focus to Non-Issues During Debates, Diverting Attention from Economic Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama campaign's post-debate strategy has been criticized for focusing on trivial matters rather than addressing significant economic issues. During the first presidential debate, Governor Mitt Romney's comments on government spending sparked a response from the Obama campaign that focused on the cuts to public broadcasting, specifically Big Bird, rather than addressing the economic issues raised.\n\nAt the second debate, Romney's use of the term \"binders full of women\" to describe his efforts to hire qualified senior-level women was met with criticism from the Obama team, who accused him of waging a \"war on women.\" However, it was later acknowledged that Romney had hired numerous senior-level women and promoted women as executives during his tenure as governor.\n\nDuring the foreign-policy debate, Romney's comment about the Navy having fewer ships than at any time since 1917 was met with Obama's response, \"Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets.\" The Obama campaign later bought the search term \"bayonets\" on Twitter, and the media declared the line as one that would \"live forever.\"\n\nThe debates have been criticized for the Obama campaign's strategy of capitalizing on small issues to divert attention away from major problems such as the economy, deficit, and entitlement spending. The Obama administration's barrage of attack ads on Romney's wealth, involvement with Bain, and shipping jobs overseas has been met with criticism for focusing on personal matters rather than addressing economic issues.\n\nRomney capitalized on the enthusiasm gap for Obama's economic policies by offering a five-point plan that would create 12 million new jobs. He positioned himself as the man with the plan, offering solutions for the middle class, and highlighted Obama's record by citing statistics on the mounting federal debt, the decline in household incomes, a growing entitlement state, and soaring gas prices.\n\nAs the election nears, it remains to be seen whether Obama's reelection strategy of diverging from four years of hostility to job creators will be successful. The next generation deserves a serious discussion of serious issues rather than political efforts to trivialize them.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Leads Donald Trump by 13 Points in New Poll, According to CNN/ORC Survey\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll released by CNN/ORC on Wednesday indicates that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leads presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by 13 points in a head-to-head match-up. The poll, conducted from April 28 to May 1, shows Clinton leading Trump by 54 percent to 41 percent.\n\nThe polling was concluded before Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas announced on Tuesday that he was suspending his campaign, which led Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus to declare that Trump will be the presumptive GOP nominee. Trump's significant win in Indiana on Tuesday effectively knocked Cruz out of the race.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont defeated Clinton in Indiana, but Clinton remains the favorite to clinch the Democratic nomination. The poll found that 56 percent of voters have an unfavorable view of Trump, compared to 41 percent who reported a favorable view. Clinton had an even 49 percent/49 percent favorable/unfavorable split.\n\nVoters said Clinton would better handle climate change, foreign policy, education, health care, the income gap between rich and poor, immigration, and terrorism, while they gave Trump the edge on the economy. In the survey, more than half of both Clinton voters and Trump voters said their vote was more about opposition to the other candidate than support for their preferred candidate.\n\nClinton led Mr. Cruz by 10 points, 52 percent to 42 percent, and Sanders beat him by 18 points, 57 percent to 39 percent. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is still in the GOP race, led Clinton head-to-head by 7 points, 51 percent to 44 percent. Sanders outperformed Clinton in head-to-head match-ups against the two remaining Republicans. The Vermont senator led Trump by 16 points, 56 percent to 40 percent, and he led Kasich by 4 points, 50 percent to 46 percent.\n\nMr. Sanders had a 61 percent/33 percent favorable/unfavorable split among voters, and Mr. Kasich had a 54 percent/29 percent split. Mr. Cruz's overall favorability, meanwhile, was worse than Trump's. The Texas senator had a 37 percent/56 percent favorable/unfavorable split.",
    " Title: Johnson's Conservative Victory: A Shift Towards Fiscal Liberalism in the UK\n\nArticle:\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn participated in a head-to-head debate on the BBC in London on December 6, 2019. The election results, with Johnson's Conservative Party securing a majority, are seen as a guarantee for Brexit, but the victory is not a triumph for traditional conservatism.\n\nThe sources of Boris Johnson's colossal victory are multiple: some voters turned away from Corbyn's anti-Semitism and hard-left economics, while others sought to complete Brexit and move forward. Despite these powerful factors and Johnson's personal appeal, he felt it necessary to add another element to secure the outright majority: a spending blowout.\n\nJohnson campaigned against the Conservative party's alleged post-financial-crisis \"austerity\" policies and promised new spending. He did not make a case for the private sector's growth, instead painting a picture of growth and economic security derived from government spending. The Left denounced him as an apostle of austerity, but it didn't work. Johnson successfully convinced the voters that if they allowed him to pull Brexit across the finish line, he would restore left-of-center economics.\n\nThough Johnson proved more formidable than Theresa May in fighting for Brexit, he has continued with her disturbing policy of conceding the premises of liberal economics. He has implemented a moratorium on fracking, accepted left-wing scaremongering about earthquakes linked to the process, and promised significant increases in spending on infrastructure, schools, the minimum wage, teacher salaries, and the National Health Service, among other areas. He also promised not to raise taxes and to decrease the budget deficit.\n\nSome of Johnson's fiscal liberalism is linked to social conservatism, with promises of longer jail sentences for violent criminals, 20,000 additional cops, fewer limits on searching suspects, and limits on immigration through an Australian-style points system. Bringing home Brexit would be the signature social-conservative achievement of the British century and make Johnson's premiership one of the most consequential in history.\n\nIn order to win his majority, Johnson had to vigorously contest seats in traditional Labour constituencies whose distaste for the Tory party is deeply ingrained. Free-spending promises may have been the only way to win those voters over and guarantee five years of Conservative government and achieve Brexit. However, the cost of this victory is a significant shift towards a more left-leaning economic platform, abandoning a core conservative principle. The parameters of British economics have taken a large step to the left. If a nominally conservative party lacks the courage or the communications skills to sell conservative economics when it can boast of having reduced unemployment to a 44-year-low and when its opponent promises to implement unreconstructed socialism, it bodes ill for those on either side of the Atlantic who wonder whether any party will ever even gesture in the direction of sane fiscal policy again.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 162,000 Jobs in July, Unemployment Rate Drops to 7.4%\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. economy added 162,000 jobs in July, according to a report by federal economists, while the unemployment rate edged down from 7.6% to 7.4%. The jobs count, which narrowly missed analyst expectations, follows Wednesday's dour news that the economy grew by only 1.7% in the second quarter. Federal economists also reduced their estimate for first-quarter growth down to 1.1%.\n\nThe 7.4% unemployment rate is the lowest of President Barack Obama's presidency, as the rate dipped to its lowest level since December of 2008. The unemployment rate is based on a separate survey\u2014one that relies on data from a survey of households\u2014than from the jobs number, which is calculated via a survey of employers' payrolls. The household survey, which has a larger margin for error than the payroll count, estimated 227,000 more people were employed in July than in the month before.\n\nHowever, the falling unemployment rate is due to both positive and negative news. While more people found jobs, 37,000 people left the labor force in July, contributing to the rate's decline.\n\n\"The report, like many of late, contains good news and less good news,\" said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, in a post on his website. \"Most of the decline in unemployment was due to more people getting jobs, but part of it was due to a slight fall off in the labor force, a signal of not-too-strong labor demand.\"\n\nThe stubbornly slow job growth left 11.5 million people unemployed, with another 8.2 million part-time employees unsuccessfully looking to add more hours to their work week. Among the unemployed, 4.2 million have been unsuccessfully seeking work for 6 months or more.\n\nIn the past year, the unemployment rate has fallen 0.8% with the count of officially unemployed persons falling by 1.2 million.\n\nAt this point, the job reports are used as little more than talking points in the fiscal debate between the White House and Republicans, but they are a key indicator for the Federal Reserve as it weighs when it will begin to scale back its efforts to stimulate the stalled economy.\n\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke has said the central bank is watching for signs that it should scale back a series of monthly multi-billion dollar asset purchases that are aimed at driving down long-term interest rates and sparking new growth.\n\nPaul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics, predicted Friday that the report will push the Fed to ramp down its efforts when the bank's policy committee next convenes in September.\n\nWhile it may not spur action in Congress, the employment report and GDP data jointly add further urgency to the newly reinvigorated economic debate between President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans.",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Reaffirms U.S. Commitment to NATO, Baltic Allies amid Tensions with Russia\n\nArticle:\n\nVice President Mike Pence, during a visit to Estonia, pledged the Trump administration's support for NATO's Baltic members in the face of perceived threats and intimidation from Russia. In a speech, Pence reiterated the U.S. commitment to the defense pact and its solidarity with the Baltic states.\n\n\"At this very moment, Russia continues to seek to redraw international borders by force, undermine the democracies of sovereign nations, and divide the free nations of Europe one against another,\" Pence said after meeting with the presidents of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\n\nPence's visit coincided with mounting tensions between the U.S. and Russia, with Russian President Vladimir Putin expelling 755 U.S. diplomats in retaliation for new sanctions legislation that the U.S. Congress passed and President Trump is expected to sign. The legislation codifies financial and diplomatic sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and meddling in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nPence's message reinforced President Trump's support of NATO's Article 5, which pledges mutual defense for all member nations and is the heart of the alliance. Pence also met with NATO troops from Britain, France, and the U.S. that are stationed in Estonia, as part of the alliance's deployment of approximately 4,000 troops and military hardware in the Baltic states and Poland to counter Russia's buildup in the region.\n\nThe former Soviet states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania became NATO members in 2004, part of a NATO expansion into Eastern Europe that alarmed Russia. Pence emphasized the importance of a strong and united NATO, stating, \"We stand together, here and across the world, because we know that a strong and united NATO is more necessary today than at any point since the collapse of communism a quarter-century ago, and no threat looms larger in the Baltic states than the specter of aggression from your unpredictable neighbor to the east.\"\n\nPence's European tour also includes stops in Georgia and Montenegro, two other countries facing strong pressure from Russia.",
    " Title: Trump's First Week with Republicans in Congress: A Test of Unlikely Partnership\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first week of President Donald Trump's term, the relationship between the new president and Republicans in Congress can be likened to a shotgun marriage, an unlikely alliance formed by circumstances, as they navigate their way through a potentially challenging partnership.\n\nDuring a speech before House and Senate Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday, President Trump showcased his characteristic bravado, boasting about his electoral victory in the state, listing his \"record\" number of executive orders, and outlining an ambitious 200-day legislative agenda. The agenda includes repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, tax reform, regulatory rollback, addressing the debt ceiling, funding the border wall, and, at the president's insistence, infrastructure.\n\nThe ambitious agenda, especially for an institution designed to be slow and deliberative, poses a significant challenge. This is not Trump's style, and his impatience and tweeting reflexes could add friction to the GOP's efforts to push their legislative priorities through Congress.\n\nThe ambition is not unprecedented. Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Senate veteran, had a \"massive agenda\" in the 1960s, including civil rights laws and his antipoverty program. However, Johnson was skilled in dealing with Congress, while Trump is not, according to James Pitney, a congressional expert at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, California.\n\n\"[Trump] has all of LBJ's ego, without any of LBJ's legislative skill,\" says Prof. Pitney. Johnson \"knew the mechanics. He knew the personalities. Trump does not.\"\n\nRepublicans plan to use a special budget process to pass their top priorities, Obamacare repeal and tax reform, by majority vote and without Democratic support. However, the issues are complex, and views differ among Republicans about how best to address them. For instance, GOP lawmakers cannot agree on whether to repeal taxes that support Obamacare or keep them in place during a transition period.\n\nAt a joint press conference with Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday, Senator Mitch McConnell was confident that they would accomplish their top priorities, but acknowledged the challenges ahead, such as confirming Trump's cabinet appointees and the upcoming Supreme Court nomination.\n\nThe president's business acumen does not translate well to Congress, according to John Feehery, former spokesman for Dennis Hastert, the longest-serving Republican speaker of the House. \"They go in, they give money, they don't get what they want, they get frustrated,\" he said, referring to Trump. \"He's on a steep learning curve.\"\n\nIn another surprise, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration was considering reopening \"black site\" prisons and undoing restrictions on interrogations. Lawmakers quickly distanced themselves from such a move, stating there would be no return to torture. The White House denied the Times story, saying the leak was an old memo from the transition period.\n\nDespite the challenges, Republicans are determined to prove their ability to govern effectively. \"This Congress is going to be the busiest Congress we've had in decades, maybe ever,\" the president told his Republican colleagues. However, the slow nature of Congress and the complexities of the issues will require patience, according to seasoned politicians like Senator Jim Risch.",
    " Title: Perry Accuses Clinton of Alienating Texas Voters over Voter ID Laws\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" former Texas Governor Rick Perry criticized Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton for her stance on voter ID laws, accusing her of alienating Texas voters. Perry's comments came in response to Clinton's speech last week, where she criticized voter ID laws, including those in Texas.\n\nIn 2011, Texas passed a strict voter identification law, which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the interview, Perry argued that Clinton was \"way outside the norm of ridiculous\" in her call for easier voter ID laws, asserting that Texas already makes it easy for residents to vote.\n\nClinton, for the first time, called out Perry, along with three other Republican presidential hopefuls, in a speech in Texas on Thursday. She also criticized their support for voter ID laws and opposition to early voting. The next day, Perry, on Fox News, accused Clinton of \"taking on\" Texas voters for supporting the voter ID law.\n\nClinton's rapid-response team, Correct the Record, responded to Perry's criticisms on \"State of the Union.\" Communications director Adrienne Watson wrote in an email that Perry and other Republicans are \"trying to deny citizens this fundamental right [to vote] under the fictional specter of voter fraud.\" Watson also accused Perry of signing a law that was intentionally written to discriminate against minority voters.\n\nIn the same interview, Perry also defended the populist tone of his announcement speech, taking another shot at Wall Street banks. He stated, \"I don't think it's right for Wall Street to be able to walk away from bad mistakes that the people on Main Street have to pay for.\" Perry added that if that was considered populism, he was proud to be a populist on that issue.\n\nAsked later on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" about what he'd do to prevent reckless Wall Street behavior, Perry said, \"regulate them,\" though he added that he believed the Dodd-Frank regulatory reforms signed by President Barack Obama went too far and were harming community banks.\n\nPerry launched his second straight presidential campaign on Thursday with an upbeat, muscular speech in an airplane hangar outside Addison, Texas. He also made an appearance at Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst's \"Roast and Ride\" event, where Perry rode a motorcycle and addressed the crowd in blue jeans and a baseball cap.\n\nOn Thursday, influential conservative activist Sam Clovis signed on to head Perry's Iowa operation, a significant boost for the former governor, who beat out Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and other conservative GOP hopefuls for his services.",
    " Title: American Public's War Skepticism and North Korea: A Closer Look at Recent Polls and U.S. Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll by the Chicago Council of Foreign Affairs (CCFA) reveals that 75 percent of Americans view North Korea as a critical threat to the United States, a significant increase from 55 percent two years ago. This heightened sense of threat does not seem to be affected by President Donald Trump's historically low approval ratings, currently standing at 38 percent.\n\nThe poll also indicates that 62 percent of respondents express a decrease in their confidence in Trump's ability as president, and 61 percent express unease about his ability to thwart North Korea. These numbers are unlikely to improve, as Trump responded to North Korea's regular threats with one of his own this afternoon.\n\nIn response to North Korea's threats, Trump stated, \"North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with the fire and the fury like the world has never seen.\" Meanwhile, the CCFA poll finds broad bipartisan support for increased sanctions against North Korea, with 76 percent of Americans favoring increased sanctions, despite their limited effectiveness over the last decade-plus.\n\nReports suggest that North Korea has successfully \"miniaturized\" a nuclear warhead for missile delivery, overshadowing progress on the diplomatic front. North Korean missile tests are followed by successful U.S. missile defense tests. The CCFA poll found a majority of Americans supporting military action if North Korea attacked South Korea, and large majorities think North Korea should not be allowed to keep its nuclear weapons.\n\nNorth Korea is unlikely to accept any arrangement where it cannot keep at least some of its weapons. The U.S. has taught the world some lessons about this in recent decades, and Pyongyang has been paying attention. The U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, but no weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) were found. The Iraq war did have a knock-on effect on proliferation, as Libyan dictator Moammar Qaddafi indicated an interest in voluntarily relinquishing his WMDs and WMD programs.\n\nThe message changed dramatically when the U.S. helped depose Qaddafi in 2011. Libya's post-disarmament experience made a powerful impression on any regime that may have been entertaining the idea of avoiding American military action by disarming. Indeed, it created a strong incentive to acquire WMDs and maintain a formidable military force as a deterrent against U.S. aggression.\n\nFor all the hype about the North Korean regime, Pyongyang has been a relatively rational actor. For decades, the regime has adeptly manipulated various regional powers and the U.S., allowing it to survive even as communism collapsed nearly everywhere else. The U.S., by contrast, has survived despite often acting in a less than rational fashion. The ocean buffer that sandwiches America has given us space to do that, as has our massive military superiority.\n\nTrump ran on a platform of questioning America's security commitments around the world. While he has since embraced much of America's role as world policemen, other countries remain understandably skeptical. This has led South Korea and even Japan to consider developing their own nuclear arsenals\u2014a development that, counterintuitively, could go a long way in improving the prospects of peace in the region. American opinion, meanwhile, is working against peace. Coupled with Trump's sinking approval ratings, the relatively widespread approval of a more aggressive approach in Korea could prompt Trump to drop any attempts at negotiation. Diplomacy is easy to mock, after all. War comes with a rally-'round-the-flag effect. This post was updated to include new comments by President Trump.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Changes to Obamacare, Insurers Caution on Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), with the final rules expected to be published in the Federal Register on Friday, allowing public comment until March 7. The proposed changes are seen as \"important first steps to rescue a collapsing Obamacare individual market\" by Senator Lamar Alexander, the Republican chairman of the Senate health committee.\n\nHowever, insurers have expressed caution, stating that the proposed changes, while helpful, would not provide a solution if the Republican-led Congress introduces legislation to repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The tighter restrictions on special enrollment periods could potentially cause problems for cancer patients, according to Christopher W. Hansen, the president of the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is also making changes that could weaken incentives for people to obtain insurance. The IRS has stated it will accept and process tax returns even if taxpayers fail to indicate whether they have coverage, qualify for an exemption, or are paying the penalty for going without insurance. The individual mandate, requiring most Americans to have insurance, is still in force until changed by Congress, according to the IRS.\n\nThe proposed changes also allow states to determine whether insurance plans have enough doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers to serve patients. This is intended to attract more insurers into the market. Insurers could also refuse to provide new coverage to consumers who failed to pay premiums owed in the previous year. If an insurer terminates coverage for non-payment of premiums, it could require consumers to pay all past-due premiums owed to that insurer before restarting coverage.\n\nLastly, insurers would be allowed to sell health plans covering a smaller share of expected costs. The administration claims this would provide consumers with \"more coverage options,\" but acknowledges that some consumers could see increases in their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. The exact impact of these changes remains to be seen, as the final rules are yet to be issued.",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Preference for Republican-Led Congress Among Likely Voters in Upcoming Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal, NBC News, and Annenberg from October 10-16 has found that a majority of likely voters prefer a Republican-led Congress in the upcoming November 4 midterm elections. The survey polled 1,172 voters and found that 49 percent of likely voters prefer a Republican-controlled Congress, compared to 44 percent who would prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress.\n\nThe poll also showed that Republicans have an advantage among all registered voters, with 45 percent preferring a Republican-led Congress, compared to 43 percent who prefer a Democratic-led Congress. This is the first time in five weeks that the GOP came out ahead, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe findings appear to reinforce polling results from last week that showed that Democrats are less interested in the election than Republicans. The survey found that among those most interested in the election, 51 percent favored the Republicans, compared to 44 percent for Democrats. Lower-interest voters support the Democrats by 52 percent, compared to 37 percent.\n\nThe survey comes as pundits continue to predict that the Republicans have the best chance of taking control of the Senate. Last week, Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, projected that the GOP could take up to eight seats. \"Our projection remains a five- to eight-seat Republican gain in the Senate, and with less than three weeks to go, we would much rather be holding the cards Republicans have been dealt versus the ones dealt to the Democrats as both sides play for a Senate majority,\" Sabato said in his \"Crystal Ball\" analysis.\n\nThe Washington Post also predicted last week that Republicans will take control of the upper chamber, and explained its analysis by looking at the most competitive races. As of Sunday, The New York Times election model gives Republicans a 69 percent chance of winning the Senate.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's low approval ratings are believed to be a major factor dragging down the Democrats' chances. His support among women, in particular, has dropped sharply in battleground states where Democrats are already lagging among male voters.",
    " Title: Trump's Response to Mueller Report: Changing the Subject Amidst Calls for Accountability\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the release of the Mueller report, President Donald Trump has been accused of changing the subject to divert attention from the investigation's findings. Instead of moving into a new phase of his presidency, as some suggest, the report's publication has allegedly led Trump to revert to his familiar pattern of response to scandals.\n\nThe pattern, according to the article, consists of three phases. First, the president lies about the facts of the matter to create uncertainty and inoculate his base and a portion of the population against accepting the reality of the situation. Second, he attacks his antagonists. Third, he attempts to change the subject.\n\nIn the case of the Mueller report, the article claims, Trump and his surrogates have asserted that the president was completely exonerated, despite Mueller not making such a judgment. They have also accused the media and Democrats of conspiring to bring down the president.\n\nSince the release of the report, the article states, Trump has attempted to change the topic in two ways: by focusing on healthcare and immigration. In healthcare, the Trump administration has advocated for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to be declared unconstitutional, potentially stripping healthcare benefits from tens of millions of Americans with no plan for alternative coverage. In immigration, Trump has increased his anti-immigrant rhetoric and threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border, a move that would harm millions of Americans and undermine cooperation with Mexico in handling the migrant crisis.\n\nThe article argues that these self-destructive measures demonstrate that what Trump is really after is headlines, not solutions. It suggests that Democrats should stay focused on obtaining a full copy of the Mueller report and making its contents known to the public, rather than going along with Trump's wishes.\n\nThe article also emphasizes the importance of establishing the principle that America has a president, not a king, and that the president is bound by the rule of law. It argues that the investigation is not about relitigating the 2016 election, but about restoring accountability to American public life, finding out how American national security was compromised in 2016, and restoring faith in American government among the public.\n\nThe article concludes by suggesting that Trump's reluctance to release the report may be due to the need to maintain control of the narrative and avoid accountability for his actions. Democrats, the article argues, should not let Trump change the subject.",
    " Title: Unlikely Republican Support for Pelosi's Speaker Bid Amidst Democratic Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi faces a challenging climb to secure the necessary support from her own party to reclaim the Speaker's gavel in January, she is receiving an unexpected source of support: Republicans.\n\nPelosi, who previously held the Speaker position between 2007 and 2011, the last time Democrats held the majority in the House, is facing a growing rebellion from her own members. A number of Democrats have signed a letter pledging not to support her for Speaker on the House floor. Fox News confirmed on Thursday that at least 17 House Democrats, including incumbents and incoming members, have signed onto a document stating they will not support Pelosi for Speaker. A Democrat familiar with the effort says they are trying to add more names before the letter is publicly released.\n\nIf all those Democrats vote against Pelosi on the floor, Pelosi would not have the votes for Speaker. To secure the gavel, Pelosi will first need to garner a majority of the Democratic caucus in internal leadership elections, then go on to win an absolute majority of the House.\n\nA group of Republicans is floating the idea of offering Pelosi support in the House, thinking it could benefit them in the long term. President Trump tweeted after the midterms that if Pelosi struggled, \"perhaps we will add some Republican votes.\" However, it was not clear if this remark was serious or tongue-in-cheek.\n\nRepublican Tom Reed suggested on Thursday that if Pelosi embraced a bipartisan package of rules reforms that would make it easier for members to get legislation to the floor, he could support her. \"A Democratic candidate who embraces these rules reforms, I will stand with,\" he told CNN. \"I am so frustrated with this institution being a top-down driven organization...it is time to change this, and if Nancy Pelosi is the only one that's there, I'm open to it.\"\n\nReed conceded that there would be \"significant backlash\" from other Republicans, but other Republicans have also suggested backing her bid\u2014as it could help them in the long term.\n\nRepublican strategist Chris Wilson suggested on \"Fox and Friends\" on Friday that Republicans should back Pelosi. \"Republicans are not going to have a speaker of the House. So why not try and...put her back in that chair?\" he asked.\n\nPelosi, at a press conference on Thursday, dismissed the idea that she would need Republican help to win the gavel. \"I intend to win the speakership with Democratic votes,\" she later said, adding that she had \"overwhelming support\" in her caucus.\n\nIn 2016, Pelosi fended off a leadership challenge from Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio. During a recent appearance on Fox News' \"Cavuto,\" Ryan said, \"I don't think this is a done deal yet\" in terms of Pelosi becoming Speaker again. Ryan also said he \"hopes somebody does\" challenge Pelosi.\n\nOn Friday, Pelosi met for 45 minutes with Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, who is mulling a prospective leadership challenge. Other Democrats have been more supportive, with House Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., telling Fox News on Friday that \"she has the experience.\"\n\n\"She's someone who gets things done. We don't need someone with a learning curve,\" Jayapal said, adding that \"we need to deliver some real wins pretty quickly.\"",
    " Title: Justice Department Refers Criminal Investigation into Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department's inspector general has referred the findings of its report on former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to federal prosecutors in Washington for potential criminal investigation. The Washington Post reports that the referral to the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office occurred after the inspector general concluded McCabe had lied to investigators or his own boss, then-FBI Director James B. Comey, on four occasions, three of them under oath.\n\nThe referral does not guarantee that McCabe will be charged with a crime. Michael R. Bromwich, McCabe's lawyer, stated in a statement that they were advised of the referral within the past few weeks. Bromwich added, \"We are confident that, unless there is inappropriate pressure from high levels of the Administration, the U.S. Attorney's Office will conclude that it should decline to prosecute.\"\n\nThe inspector general's report, which Attorney General Jeff Sessions used as the basis for firing McCabe last month, was leaked almost as soon as it was completed. Similarly, news of McCabe's criminal referral was also leaked on Thursday, though the referral was made weeks ago or even longer.\n\nThe inspector general's report specifically charged that McCabe \"lacked candor\" with internal investigators at the agency and concluded he was not authorized to disclose to reporters the existence of an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nFormer FBI Assistant Director Frank Figliuzzi, on MSNBC Thursday, called the criminal referral on such a matter \"unprecedented.\" Figliuzzi stated, \"If this is indeed true, that the charge that's being referred or recommended is for a 'lack of candor' during an internal inquiry, I can not recall that ever happening in my 25-year FBI career.\" Figliuzzi added that approving an unauthorized leak could rise to the level of criminal referral.",
    " Title: Melania Trump's Speech at the Republican National Convention Alleged to Contain Plagiarized Passages from Michelle Obama\n\nArticle:\n\nMelania Trump's speech at the opening night of the Republican National Convention has been accused of plagiarizing passages from Michelle Obama's address to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. A section of Trump's speech, focusing on the values she and her husband share, appears to be a direct copy of Obama's comments on the same subject eight years ago.\n\nThe controversy marked a chaotic start to the Republican National Convention. The day began with Trump's campaign attacking popular Ohio Governor and former presidential challenger John Kasich for not attending the convention in Cleveland. By the afternoon, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was rallying people outside, only to be interrupted by a popular comedian asking the fringe radio host to \"have sex with my wife.\"\n\nLater in the day, a fight erupted on the convention floor, with anti-Trump delegates demanding a roll call vote before the RNC got underway. At another point, Rep. Steve King was on MSNBC suggesting white people are superior to any \"sub-groups.\" By the evening, speaker after speaker recalled in detail the attacks on the U.S. compound in Benghazi.\n\nMelania took the stage and, almost line-for-line, repeated passages that Michelle Obama had spoken in 2008. Here are the similarities:\n\n\"From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect,\" Melania said. \"They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily life. That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son, and we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.\"\n\n\"Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you\u2019re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you do not know them, and even if you do not agree with them. And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generation. Because we want our children\u2014and all children in this nation\u2014to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them,\" Michelle Obama said.\n\nBefore the convention, Team Trump told CNN that Melania spent five to six weeks working on the speech. She told Matt Lauer on Monday afternoon that she had \"as little help as possible\" writing it.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not acknowledge the plagiarism allegation when it first surfaced. \"In writing her beautiful speech, Melania\u2019s team of writers took notes on her life\u2019s inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking,\" spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement late Monday. \"Melania\u2019s immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it such a success.\"\n\nBy 1:30 a.m., the campaign finally addressed the plagiarism, and attacked Hillary Clinton. \"This is once again an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, she\u2019ll... take her down,\" campaign manager Paul Manafort told CNN. \"It\u2019s not going to work.\"\n\nBy 7:30 a.m., Chris Christie offered a more qualified defense of Melania's speech when the Today show asked him if it was plagiarism. \"Not when 93 percent of the speech is completely different than Michelle Obama\u2019s speech,\" he said. \"They expressed some common thoughts.\"\n\nThe idea that any Republican would share \"common thoughts\" with Michelle Obama would have been shocking to the GOP until last night. Republicans went ballistic when the future First Lady told a crowd of voters in Feb. 2008, \"For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.\"\n\nThe Obamas subsequently explained that what she meant was that she was thrilled to see Americans turning out to vote, but the meme that the Princeton and Harvard Law grad was a crypto-black militant had stuck.\n\nTo take but one example from Glenn Beck in 2012, \"This is who they are. They\u2019re anti-colonialists. They believe America has oppressed the rest of the world.\"\n\nTrump himself used Joe Biden's plagiarism scandal to question Obama's running mate in 2008, telling Wolf Blitzer, \"You know, he's also been involved in pretty big controversy like plagiarism in college and various other things. That's a pretty big statement. So perhaps you change over a period of time. But when you plagiarize, that's a very bad statement.\"",
    " Title: \"SeaWorld Responds to Allegations in Documentary \"Blackfish\"\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe documentary \"Blackfish,\" which aired on CNN and portrays the treatment of killer whales in captivity at SeaWorld, has led to a decline in visitors to the theme park. The film alleges that the captivity of these animals is cruel, with greedy businessmen taking baby whales from their mothers and imprisoning them in small aquariums, causing psychological trauma.\n\nHowever, SeaWorld has responded to these allegations, stating that they have not separated whales from their mothers in 35 years and have no plans to do so in the future. They claim that much of the film is deceitful and that the things described in the documentary did not happen.\n\nOne of the most controversial scenes in \"Blackfish\" is a mournful cry of a mother whale whose baby was taken from her. However, SeaWorld claims that the \"baby\" in question was an adult with its own offspring, and the scene was manipulated with sound effects that are not even appropriate for killer whales.\n\nThe film also claims that captive whales' droopy dorsal fins indicate that the whales are miserable. However, whale expert Ingrid Visser states that killer whales in the wild also have collapsed dorsal fins.\n\nSeaWorld claims that its whales are \"happy.\" While it is acknowledged that it is impossible to know what the whales are thinking, SeaWorld's head veterinarian Chris Dold states that he knows his dog is happy and that they have a good relationship.\n\nThere have been instances of conflict between humans and whales at SeaWorld, such as a whale drowning a trainer. However, SeaWorld argues that there is no evidence that the whale's behavior was a result of frustration due to living in a tank.\n\n\"Blackfish\" also claims that captive whales die young, but SeaWorld points out that they have a 50-year-old whale living at SeaWorld, and their life parameters are the same as whales in the wild.\n\nThe documentary has sparked controversy and debate, with some arguing that it is cruel to imprison whales in tanks where they are forced to perform tricks. However, SeaWorld argues that marine parks and zoos are often the only way people learn about nature, and ticket sales fund education and conservation efforts. SeaWorld alone has helped rescue 25,000 animals.\n\nIt is important to note that the opinions expressed in this article are based on the information provided in the source text and do not reflect any personal opinions or biases of the author. The author does not presume to know if it is moral to keep animals in captivity, but acknowledges that the activists may distort the truth.",
    " Title: Trump Discusses CNN Correspondent, Mueller Investigation, and Foreign Policy in Fox News Sunday Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a taped interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, President Donald Trump addressed a range of topics, including the behavior of CNN correspondent Jim Acosta, his appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, and foreign policy concerns regarding North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan.\n\nThe president criticized Acosta's behavior during a recent press briefing, stating, \"CNN's White House correspondent was unbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\" If Acosta misbehaves, Trump warned, \"we'll throw him out or we'll stop the news conference.\"\n\nTrump also discussed his appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting Attorney General, stating that he was unaware of Whitaker's past remarks about the Mueller investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia when he appointed Whitaker to replace Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice.\n\nIn the interview, Trump also commented on the recent midterm elections, expressing his support for GOP Senate candidate Rick Scott in Florida. He claimed that without his intervention, Scott would have lost the election due to \"votes that disappeared at the very end.\"\n\nRegarding foreign policy, Trump expressed solidarity with the mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, stating that the U.S. is \"ill-prepared\" to absorb the caravan of migrants traveling through Mexico towards the U.S. border. He also urged Democrats to \"approve Border Security & Wall NOW!\"\n\nTrump also discussed his interactions with former President Barack Obama, stating that Obama offered him guidance on North Korea shortly after his 2016 election. He also mentioned the ongoing tensions with Saudi Arabia, stating, \"We give Pakistan $1.3 billion a year...[bin Laden] lived in Pakistan, we're supporting Pakistan, we're giving them $1.3 billion a year--which we don't give them anymore, by the way.\"\n\nTrump also expressed regret for not visiting Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day, stating, \"I should have done that...I was extremely busy on calls for the country...I probably, you know, in retrospect I should have and I did last year and I will virtually every year.\"",
    " Title: DEA and ATF Collaborate on Monitoring Gun Show Attendees with Automatic License Plate Readers, ACLU Reveals\n\nArticle:\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has disclosed information obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request that reveals a collaboration between the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to monitor gun show attendees using automatic license plate readers (ALPRs).\n\nAccording to an email from April 2009, the DEA Phoenix Division Office is working closely with the ATF on plans to monitor gun shows, including programs or operations with ALPRs at the gun shows. The government redacted parts of the email, but the ACLU concluded that these agencies used ALPRs to collect information about law-abiding citizens attending gun shows.\n\nAn ALPR cannot distinguish between individuals transporting illegal guns, legal guns, or no guns at all; it only documents the presence of any car driving to the event. Mere attendance at a gun show, it appears, would have been enough to have one's presence noted in a DEA database.\n\nIn response to inquiries about the document, the DEA stated that the monitoring of gun shows was merely a proposal and was never implemented. The ACLU, however, had rationally concluded, based on the scrap of information left unredacted in the document, that gun show monitoring was underway.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the Department of Justice's own surveys of prison inmates show that criminals do not primarily obtain their firearms from gun shows. The ACLU's revelation raises concerns about potential infringements on the constitutionally protected right to assemble.\n\nThe collaboration between the DEA and ATF, and their apparent interest in tracking law-abiding, innocent gun show attendees, is particularly striking in light of the agencies' lack of interest in tracking more than 2,500 weapons they purposely provided to Mexican-narco terrorists through Operation Fast and Furious, which were used to kill hundreds of people, including U.S. federal law enforcement officers.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Challenges Faced by Immigrant Students in U.S. Schools and the Importance of Supportive Environments\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent study has shed light on the experiences of immigrant students in American schools, revealing that a significant number of students face negative perceptions from their peers and challenges in integrating into the educational system.\n\nThe study found that 65 percent of the students surveyed were met with negative adjectives when their national origin was mentioned, with comments such as \"lazy,\" \"gangsters,\" \"drug addicts,\" and \"job stealers\" being common. A 14-year-old boy from the Bay Area shared, \"Most Americans think we are lazy, gangsters, drug addicts, that only come to take their jobs away.\"\n\nThe research also indicated that many educators view immigrant parents as uninformed and uninvolved, further complicating the challenges faced by these students. The study found that having just one friend who spoke English fluently was a strong predictor of positive academic outcomes. However, more than a third of the students reported little or no opportunity to interact with native-born students.\n\nThe study also highlighted the difficulties faced by students who immigrate during their high school years, particularly those who experience interrupted schooling, family instability, and traumatic dislocations. The younger brother of the Boston Marathon bombers, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is an example of this, as he was a \"smart\" and \"respected\" student in high school but struggled academically at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth.\n\nDespite these challenges, the study found that a quarter of the students sustained high academic performance over five years, and another 11 percent showed significant improvement. These students tended to be enrolled in supportive schools, have caring teachers, and develop informal mentorships with coaches, counselors, or ministers.\n\nThe study also found that the second generation, American-born children of immigrant parents, assimilate and excel to a greater extent than the \"1.5 generation\" (children who immigrate in or before their early teens).\n\nThe study's findings suggest that providing academic, psychological, and other supports to immigrant students is crucial for their successful integration into American society. The Internationals Network for Public Schools, which focuses on students' distinct needs and develops authentic connections with their families, is one successful model.\n\nThe study's authors caution that the experiences of the Tsarnaev brothers, who faced family estrangement, multiple relocations, and possibly religious radicalization, are not representative of all immigrant students. However, they emphasize that the broad lesson - assimilating immigrant students into the fabric of society through academic, psychological, and other supports - should inform educators and policy makers in the future, as immigrants and their children will account for most of the nation's population growth.",
    " Title: George Zimmerman's Wife Sentenced to Probation and Community Service for Perjury\n\nArticle:\n\nShellie Zimmerman, the wife of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer acquitted in the killing of Trayvon Martin, has been sentenced to one year of probation and 100 hours of community service after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor perjury charge for lying at her husband's bond hearing.\n\nOn April 22, 2012, during her husband's bond hearing, Shellie Zimmerman told Judge Kenneth Lester that the couple had little funds. However, in a court filing, State Attorney Angela Corey stated that Shellie Zimmerman perjured herself by failing to reveal that George Zimmerman had collected more than $100,000 through Internet donations.\n\nAccording to recordings of jail calls released by the Florida State Attorney's Office, George Zimmerman instructed Shellie Zimmerman on how to transfer money from his bank account into hers and his sister's while he was in jail in April 2012. According to an affidavit, Shellie Zimmerman transferred more than $74,000 to her personal account days before the April bond hearing, with nearly $50,000 transferred to an account held by Zimmerman's sister.\n\nTaped phone calls between the couple revealed that they had discussed the money transfers in code to hide the funds, according to the affidavit. Prosecutors allege that Zimmerman and his wife talked about $10, $20, and $100 to mask the fact that they were referring to thousands of dollars. The calls also showed that George Zimmerman instructed his wife to \"pay off all the bills,\" including payments to American Express and Sam's Club.\n\nJudge Lester ruled on June 3, 2012, that Shellie Zimmerman had \"testified untruthfully\" about their finances. She was later arrested on June 12, 2012, and jailed briefly in Seminole County before posting a $1,000 bond.\n\nGeorge Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, in a gated townhouse community in Sanford, Fla., as the teen returned home from buying snacks at a convenience store. Zimmerman said he shot the unarmed teenager in self-defense after being attacked. A jury last month found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter.\n\nShellie Zimmerman had originally faced a third-degree felony perjury charge but the court accepted a plea deal. On Wednesday, she pleaded guilty to \"perjury not in official proceedings,\" which is a misdemeanor. She also filed in open court a letter of apology to Lester. The details of the letter were not immediately available.\n\nAssistant State Attorney John Guy, one of the attorneys who argued before the court at George Zimmerman's trial, was back in court to handle Shellie Zimmerman's case.\n\nAs part of Shellie Zimmerman's one-year probation, she was given a list of conditions she must abide by. In part, she cannot possess, carry, or own a firearm and must get permission to own any other type of weapon. She also must get permission from her probation officer before moving, changing jobs, or leaving the county where she lives.\n\nShe must also report regularly to a probation officer, pay $263 in court fees/fines, and pay the state of Florida $50 per month as a cost of supervision while on probation. Her probation can also be revoked if she violates the law, associates with anyone engaged in criminal activity, or uses any drugs not prescribed by a doctor.",
    " Title: Trump Extends Social Distancing Guidelines for 30 More Days to Combat Coronavirus\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Sunday that the federal guidelines urging Americans to socially distance to slow the spread of the coronavirus will remain in place for another month, potentially lasting until June. The guidelines, which were initially set for 15 days, are now extended until April 30, with formalized plans to be announced on Tuesday.\n\nUnder the guidelines, the Trump administration is urging people to avoid restaurants, bars, and other situations involving more than 10 people and to restrict travel to essential trips only. During a news conference in the Rose Garden, Trump emphasized the importance of following the guidelines, stating, \"The better you do, the faster this whole nightmare will end.\"\n\nTrump had initially announced 15-day guidelines, which were set to end on Monday, and had suggested the recommendations could be relaxed. However, on Sunday, Trump said the guidelines will continue to ask Americans to socially distance until April 30.\n\nModels of the virus's spread indicate that the worst days of the pandemic could hit the country in two weeks, according to Trump. The president had previously stated he would like to see the country \"reopen\" for business on Easter, a notion that deeply unsettled infectious disease experts, who said such a move could exacerbate the crisis.\n\nTrump's optimistic assessment was not a mistake, he said on Sunday. \"It was just an aspiration,\" Trump said. \"That could be the peak number of deaths before it starts coming down.\" The president said of coronavirus cases around Easter, which is April 12, \"It was just an aspiration.\"\n\nTrump's decision to extend the social distancing guidelines was made following conversations with Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, two doctors and public health experts on the White House's coronavirus task force. Fauci and Birx pointed to leading coronavirus models, which they said show that, even with social distancing and other mitigation measures in place, millions of Americans are anticipated to become infected and up to 200,000 could die. If social distancing is not followed, the estimates are even more grim, Trump noted, saying the model suggested some 2.2 million Americans could have died in the U.S. if officials ended containment efforts.\n\n\"Now we're looking at numbers that are going to be much, much, much lower than that,\" Trump said. \"And it makes everything we're doing feel much better to me.\"\n\nThe hope is that the model's estimates are overstating the likely case load and death toll, according to Birx. \"We can do better than what the predictions are,\" Birx said.\n\nTrump indicated that months more of social distancing could be in store, saying he hopes the country's rebound from the virus will start in June. \"We think by June 1, a lot of great things will be happening,\" Trump said.\n\nCoronavirus cases in the U.S. continue to soar, and virus-related deaths are mounting, with America's total fatalities doubling in just two days. More than 2,000 people affected by the virus in the United States have now died, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nExpecting the surge of coronavirus cases to continue, state and local officials are bracing for shortages of medical equipment and supplies. State leaders, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, the nation's current virus epicenter, are predicting that in the coming weeks critical supplies like ventilators could be far outmatched by the volume of critically ill coronavirus patients.\n\nIn the news conference on Sunday, Trump raised suspicions, without evidence, that medical professionals could be \"hoarding\" masks. \"Something's going on,\" said Trump, urging reporters to look into why supplies are being used so rapidly. \"Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 [used normally] to 300,000?\"\n\nThe president made the same unsubstantiated claim against hospitals, floating the unproven idea that hospitals could be hoarding ventilators. During Sunday's briefing, federal officials highlighted that the pace of testing has substantially sped up in recent weeks. About 894,000 tests have been conducted nationally as of Saturday, according to Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health and head of the Public Health Service, who is overseeing the administration's testing coordination.\n\nThe news conference took a hostile turn when PBS NewsHour reporter Yamiche Alcindor asked the president about remarks he made on Fox News Channel saying he did not believe states like New York need the number of ventilators state leaders are requesting. \"I did not say that,\" Trump said, denying words that were broadcast nationally to Fox News host Sean Hannity. \"Why do you act a little bit more positive? It always trying to 'get you. Get ya. Get ya.' \"\n\nThe president then attempted to make a disparaging remark to Alcindor for leaving The New York Times to join PBS.",
    " Title: Islamic State Claims Responsibility for Deadly New York Truck Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nIslamic State has claimed responsibility for a truck attack in New York City that killed eight people, marking the deadliest assault on the city since September 11, 2001. The militant group made the claim in a weekly issue of its Al-Naba newspaper, identifying the accused attacker, Sayfullo Saipov, as \"one of the caliphate soldiers.\"\n\nSaipov, a 29-year-old Uzbek immigrant, was charged in federal court on Wednesday for acting in support of Islamic State by driving a rented pickup truck down a popular riverside bike path, resulting in the deaths of eight pedestrians and cyclists and injuring a dozen more. According to the criminal complaint against him, Saipov told investigators he was inspired by watching Islamic State propaganda videos on his cellphone, felt good about what he had done, and asked for permission to display the group's flag in his hospital room in New York.\n\nSaipov was shot in the abdomen by a police officer before his arrest and was taken to Bellevue Hospital. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for Saipov to receive the death penalty, said on Twitter on Friday that Islamic State had claimed Saipov as their soldier, responsible for the \"Degenerate Animal\" who killed and wounded \"the wonderful people on the West Side\" of Lower Manhattan.\n\nIn the Middle East, the Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate appeared to be on the verge of defeat, with Syrian government forces seizing its last major city on one side of the border and Iraqi troops taking its last big town on the other. The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is believed to be hiding in the desert near the frontier, and regional officials fear the group will reconstitute itself as a guerrilla force, capable of waging attacks without territory to defend.\n\nSaipov's sister believes he may have been brainwashed, and she appealed to Trump on Friday to ensure he gets a fair trial. Speaking by phone from the Uzbek capital Tashkent, she expressed hope that Trump would help make sure her brother was given \"more time\" and \"a fair trial.\" In a separate interview with Radio Free Europe, she said she spoke with her brother the day before the attack and he was in a good mood.\n\nFive Argentine tourists, a Belgian woman, a New Yorker, and a New Jersey man were among those killed in Tuesday afternoon's attack. The attack unfolded just blocks from the site of the World Trade Center, where some 2,600 people were killed when suicide hijackers crashed two jetliners into the Twin Towers 16 years ago. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has located another Uzbek man, Mukhammadzoir Kadirov, 32, who it said was wanted for questioning as a person of interest in the attack.",
    " Title: Bill Gates Warns of Future Epidemics in Article for New England Journal of Medicine\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Bill Gates, a businessman and philanthropist, has outlined a potential scenario for future epidemics of highly infectious diseases. He emphasized the need for the world to learn from the Ebola outbreak and prepare for future epidemics that may be more infectious than Ebola.\n\nGates wrote that there is a significant chance that an epidemic of a substantially more infectious disease will occur within the next 20 years. He cited major epidemics that occurred during the 20th century, such as the Spanish influenza epidemic of 1918-1919 and the ongoing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic, as examples.\n\nGates further stated that the most likely cause of an epidemic that could kill more than 10 million people worldwide is an epidemic stemming from either natural causes or bioterrorism. He suggested that the world should treat future epidemics like war, requiring a plan and an organization to manage and coordinate responses.\n\nGates pointed out that despite efforts by the United States and a few other countries, there are still significant gaps in the world's ability to respond to an epidemic. He proposed a rigorous study of the cost of building a global warning and response system and a plan for contributions from various countries.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with Gates' assessment that the problem lies with international response. Emmanuel d'Harcourt, senior health director of the International Rescue Committee, told NPR that while a global response system might be helpful, that's not where the trouble is. D'Harcourt emphasized the importance of local preparedness and response, stating that local responders are usually the first to act in most disasters, including epidemics.\n\nA year after the Ebola outbreak began, cases continue in Sierra Leone, and they are on the rise in Guinea, according to the World Health Organization.",
    " Title: Media's Criticism of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe media's coverage of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election has been characterized by intense scrutiny of the candidates, particularly Republican nominee Donald Trump. The New York Times, in a recent article, alleged that Trump could have avoided paying income tax for 18 years due to business losses in the 1990s. It is important to note that the article states \"could have,\" not \"did.\"\n\nThe media's portrayal of Trump has been criticized as harsh, with some commentators going as far as to diagnose him with psychiatric conditions such as being a \"puerile, sophomoric sniveler\" and a \"terroristic man-toddler.\" The media's coverage has been accused of overshadowing the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, and her political record.\n\nClinton's campaign has been characterized by some as lacking in ideas and convictions of significant importance to the country. During the primaries, her positions on various issues shifted significantly in response to her main rival, Bernie Sanders. Sanders, a self-proclaimed progressive, pushed Clinton to the left on issues such as free college and a higher minimum wage.\n\nThe media's focus on Trump's personal attributes, such as his unfitness for the presidency, has been criticized for deflecting attention from Clinton's own political record and lack of evidence of significant convictions beyond a desire for power and acclaim. The potential consequences of a Clinton presidency, in terms of policy and the direction of the country, remain a topic of debate.",

By late July, the list had been further reduced to five men, after former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice declined the campaign's invitation to be vetted. Romney eventually chose Representative Paul Ryan.\n\nDonald Trump's 2016 vetting process was less structured, but among those he interviewed during his search was Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa.\n\nHillary Clinton started with a list of 40 potential candidates for the vice presidency in 2016. This list was narrowed to nine who underwent a process of serious vetting, an interview, and a campaign appearance with the candidate. While Clinton considered several women for the vice presidency, only Senator Elizabeth Warren advanced to the final stages of the process.\n\nFor the 2020 Democratic presidential election, Joe Biden, 77, is aiming to select a woman as his running mate. A younger woman could help assuage concerns about Biden's age and address critiques about a primary process that started with the most diverse field in history and ended with two white men. Biden's campaign hopes the early announcement that he will select a woman will generate enthusiasm from voters, even as the presidential election is affected by the coronavirus.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden's campaign sent a fund-raising appeal asking supporters to \"commit to standing with\" Biden and his future female running mate. By announcing he will pick a woman, Biden is aiming to give his ticket a modern-day balance in a party focused on issues of racial and gender representation.\n\nChoosing Senator Kamala Harris, 55, would not only provide gender balance but also add a black woman to the ticket after black voters helped revive Biden's campaign in February. However, recent criticism from Jill Biden may impact Harris' chances. The specific nature of Jill Biden's criticism of Harris is not available in the provided text.",
    " Title: Foxconn's Planned Wisconsin Facility Shifts from Manufacturing to Technology Hub, Job Creation Lags\n\nArticle:\n\nThe tech giant Foxconn, initially promised to build a manufacturing facility in suburban Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with a commitment of more than $3 billion in subsidies, is now reconsidering its plans. Instead of the promised 13,000 blue-collar jobs, the company is likely to transform the Wisconsin facility into a \"technology hub\" that will focus on research facilities and the production of specialized tech products.\n\nLouis Woo, a high-ranking assistant to Terry Gou, Foxconn's chairman, told Reuters that the jobs created will primarily be \"knowledge\" positions, not blue-collar jobs. This shift in strategy was already hinted at in November when The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was planning to import workers from Taiwan and China to meet its hiring goals in Wisconsin.\n\nFoxconn is currently lagging behind its job-creation promises. While the company originally promised to create 5,200 jobs by the end of 2020, Foxconn stated earlier this month that the actual number would be about 1,000.\n\nThe problems with the Foxconn factory were not difficult to foresee. Building television screens with relatively expensive American labor was always a question mark, and it was never clear how Foxconn planned to operate a massive manufacturing center \"in what was essentially the middle of nowhere, without the sort of dense ecosystem of suppliers and sub-suppliers required for making a major factory hum.\"\n\nFoxconn has a history of abandoning similar projects. The company previously walked away from a plan to invest $5 billion and create 50,000 jobs in India, and similar deals in Vietnam and Brazil. Even in America, there was evidence that Foxconn should not be trusted to make good. A planned manufacturing facility in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was supposed to employ 500 people and come with a $30 million investment, but it never materialized.\n\nEven if everything had worked out, the Foxconn giveaway was a bad idea. According to Wisconsin's Legislative Fiscal Bureau, it would take the state until 2043 to recoup the $3 billion handout, which was the largest such subsidy in Wisconsin history. Even if all 13,000 promised jobs went to Wisconsinites, the tab would be more than $230,000 per job created.\n\nAnother lousy part of the deal is the use of eminent domain to remove residents of Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin, where the new facility is to be built. Foxconn will receive more than 1,000 acres of land for free, with the logic being that the subsequent increase in land value will pay for itself eventually in the form of higher property taxes.\n\nIt was always unlikely that the Foxconn deal would live up to the promises made by the company, former Republican Gov. Scott Walker, and President Donald Trump. That it is failing so spectacularly, and so early, should serve as a stern warning to the next politician who considers a similar scheme.",
    " Title: New York City Sees Surge in Adoptions Amidst Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, an unexpected shortage has arisen in New York City: pets, particularly adopted or fostered cats and dogs. Shelters such as Muddy Paws Rescue and Best Friends Animal Society are reporting a significant increase in applications, with some shelters running out of or nearing depletion of animals.\n\nNew Yorkers, ordered to shelter in place, appear to be adopting pets as a means to alleviate boredom and anxiety. Anna Lai, the marketing director at Muddy Paws, stated, \"For the moment, we definitely don't have any dogs left to match with foster volunteers. Which is a great problem to have.\"\n\nThis surge in pet adoptions is reflected in the stock market, with Chewy Inc., an online pet product supplier, experiencing a 7% increase this year. The increased volume has led to delivery times of between seven and ten days for most customers, according to the company's website.\n\nRBC Capital Markets noted in a report, \"Chewy\u2019s in-home delivery model mitigates the public health concern of consumers shopping at brick-and-mortar retailers.\" Additionally, pet food is considered recession-proof, providing another advantage for pet-related companies during economic downturns.\n\nThe trend of adopting pets seems to extend beyond New York City, particularly in disease hotspots. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported a 70% increase in animals going into foster care in Los Angeles. Best Friends Animal Society also reported similar trends in shelters across the United States.\n\nHowever, rescue organizations are concerned about a potential rise in surrendered pets as Americans lose their jobs and may not be able to care for their animals. Lisa LaFontaine, CEO of the Humane Rescue Alliance, which operates adoption centers in the District of Columbia and New Jersey, stated, \"We don't know what's going to happen when the economic wave starts hitting.\"\n\nDespite the current shortage, some individuals are still finding and welcoming new pets into their homes. Tom Drescher and his wife, Becky Nolin, recently adopted a 10-year-old mixed breed dog named Goldie, found online at an adoption site. Drescher, 35, shared, \"It occurred to us it would be a good time to adopt a dog because we'd have the time and bandwidth to help it settle in. It's been a blast for us so far\u2014we've been thrilled to have her.\"",
    " Title: FBI Investigation into Hillary Clinton's Emails and WikiLeaks Releases Add Uncertainty to Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nThe race for the White House has become increasingly uncertain as federal investigators begin searching through newly discovered emails belonging to Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin. The emails were found on a laptop belonging to Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, who is currently under investigation for allegedly sexting an underage girl. Officials have obtained a warrant to search those emails, but it is unlikely the review will be completed by Election Day.\n\nMeanwhile, the presidential race has tightened dramatically in the last several days. The gap was closing even before Friday's news that the FBI would reopen the investigation into Clinton's emails, but now the contest is virtually a dead heat. Even though the polls are close, Clinton still has an apparent advantage in the Electoral College. Consequently, both candidates are hitting key swing states where the election will likely be decided.\n\nAddressing supporters at a rally in Kent, Ohio, on Monday, the former secretary of state sounded defiant about the email controversy. \"I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of wrongdoing with just days to go?\" Clinton said. \"That's a good question,\" she continued. \"First of all, for those of you who are concerned about my use of personal email, I understand. As I said, I'm not making excuses; I understand and I regret it,\" she continued. \"They should look at them. And I'm sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year. There is no case here.\"\n\nMeanwhile, campaigning in Michigan, Republican rival Donald Trump kept his focus on Clinton's latest controversy. \"Thank you, Anthony. I never liked you, Anthony, but thank you very much,\" the GOP nominee said. \"The Clinton crime spree ends on Nov. 8. It's gon'na end on Nov. 8.\"\n\nClinton could face more problems in the days ahead. WikiLeaks is reportedly set to release more hacked emails related to the presidential campaign. The organization has already caused another problem for Democratic operatives. CNN dropped former analyst Donna Brazile after WikiLeaks revealed she had leaked a question from one of the debates in the Democratic primary to the Clinton campaign.\n\nNo one knows what effect the FBI investigation or the WikiLeaks releases will have before Election Day. The last week before the election could be as unpredictable as the entire campaign has been so far this year.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Elect Chuck Schumer as Minority Leader for New Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Democrats have elected New York Senator Chuck Schumer as their minority leader for the new Congress. In his first remarks following his election, Schumer stated, \"I am going to wake up every single day focused on how Senate Democrats can effectively fight for America's middle class and those struggling to join it.\"\n\nSchumer emphasized the need for his party to learn from its recent election losses and unite behind a stronger economic message that acknowledges the system's unfairness to many Americans and the need for improvement. To this end, he expanded the Democratic leadership team from seven to ten members, adding former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of Vermont as outreach chairman, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin as Democratic Conference secretary, and moderate Joe Manchin of West Virginia as vice chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee.\n\nSchumer acknowledged a post-election debate among Democrats about the party's direction but emphasized the need for a unified approach that speaks to and works on behalf of all Americans. He emphasized the need for a \"bigger, bolder, sharper-edged economic message\" that focuses on helping middle-class Americans do better and deals directly with the unfairness in the American economic system.\n\nSchumer emphasized the importance of learning from the election results, stating, \"When you lose an election like this, you can't flinch. You can't ignore it. You need to look it right in the eye and ask why, analyze it, and learn from it.\" He noted that the American people felt that the government was not working for them and that the economy was rigged against them in many places.\n\nSchumer suggested that Democrats may find common ground with President-elect Donald Trump, stating, \"A silver lining in the deep clouds of this election is that President-elect Trump and his campaign were closer to us (on the economic issue) than to the Republican leadership.\"\n\nSchumer will replace 77-year-old Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, who opted to retire rather than run for re-election to the Senate. Schumer, who turns 66 next week, offers a much different style than Reid, who grew up in tiny Searchlight, Nev. Reid was a savvy backroom deal-maker but is not as telegenic or outgoing as Schumer.\n\nSchumer will be negotiating with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who was re-elected to the top leadership spot by his GOP colleagues on Wednesday. McConnell has been majority leader since 2015 and served as minority leader in the previous four Congresses. Both Schumer and McConnell are Senate veterans, with McConnell, 74, being Kentucky's longest-serving senator, and Schumer having been elected 18 years ago after serving in the House representing Brooklyn and Queens for 18 years.\n\nThroughout his career, Schumer has sponsored significant legislation, including the Omnibus Crime Bill, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Brady Bill. In the Senate, he was one of the \"gang of eight\" senators who crafted a bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 but was never taken up by the House.\n\nSchumer was born in Brooklyn in 1950 and was one of three children born to Selma, a homemaker, and Abe, who owned a small pest extermination business. After graduating from Harvard Law School, Schumer returned home to Brooklyn and won a seat in the New York State Assembly. At age 29, he won his first congressional race.\n\nSchumer still lives in Brooklyn with his wife, Iris Weinshall, and they have two grown daughters. Weinshall is the chief operating officer of the New York Public Library, former vice chancellor at the City University of New York, and former commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation.",
    " Title: Record Number of Voters Register to Vote in 2018 Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2018 midterm elections, scheduled for November 6, are witnessing a surge in voter registration across the United States. According to data, more than 800,000 people registered to vote on National Voter Registration Day in September, compared to 154,500 in 2014. This increase in political engagement is being seen as a significant indicator of the upcoming battle for Congress.\n\nThe heightened political activity is attributed to the polarizing nature of Donald Trump's presidency, which has energized voters from both the left and right. For Democrats, the elections represent the first opportunity to channel the energy from marches and protests into tangible action at the ballot box. Republicans, on the other hand, view the midterms as another chapter in the culture wars that have characterized Trump's first term.\n\nThe outcome of the elections will determine which party controls Congress and could potentially alter the course of Trump's presidency. Democrats need to flip 24 Republican seats to regain the majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 2010. The Senate map is more favorable to Republicans, who are aiming to expand on a narrow 51-49 seat majority by defeating several red-state Democratic incumbents.\n\nSeveral states have reported record numbers of voters registering to cast their ballots in November. In California, 19 million residents have registered to vote, an increase of about 1.5 million compared to the 2014 midterms. A similar trend was observed in Texas, where state officials reported an 11% rise in registered voters from the previous midterms.\n\nCalifornia hosts several key battleground races for the House, while the Senate race between Democrat Beto O'Rourke and Republican Ted Cruz in Texas is one of the most closely watched contests. A record number of people also registered to vote last month on National Voter Registration Day.\n\nHowever, it remains uncertain how many of the newly registered voters will actually cast their ballots. Michael McDonald, an associate professor of political science at the University of Florida, stated that there was not yet enough data to draw any definitive conclusions, and that there had been little evidence to suggest the kind of turnout in midterms that the country typically sees when the White House is in play.\n\nPoliticians, celebrities, and other public figures have intensified their calls for voters to register as deadlines approach in states that could prove influential in November. Trump, who has increased his campaign appearances for Republican candidates, urged his supporters to register to vote in a tweet on Tuesday. Celebrities such as Rihanna and Taylor Swift have also joined the chorus, using their social media platforms to encourage voter registration.\n\nRaven Brooks, the COO of Vote.org, noted that celebrities were particularly effective in motivating young voters to the polls. He reported a significant increase in voter registrations, with the majority of registrations coming from voters aged 18 to 24, followed by those aged 25 to 29. This trend is a stark contrast to the 2016 election year, where registration numbers were dominated by voters aged 30 to 39 and older.\n\n\"You're getting a lot of people into the process that are new voters, they're young voters,\" said Brooks. \"That changes, over time, what our political leaders look like.\"",
    " Title: Missouri Republican Primary Debate Remains Civil, Health Care and Federal Spending Dominate Discussion\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican primary for the Missouri Senate seat currently held by Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill took a civil turn during a debate on Monday night near St. Louis. The candidates, Rep. Todd Akin, businessman John Brunner, and former state Treasurer Sarah Steelman, answered questions about health care, federal spending, and foreign policy in a 90-minute debate at Lindenwood University in St. Charles.\n\nHealth care was a dominant topic of the evening. All three candidates expressed their desire to repeal President Obama's health care law, including provisions that some Republicans support, such as requiring insurers to cover young adults on their parents' plans.\n\nWhen asked about their health care plans, Mr. Brunner supported the Medicare plan written by Rep. Paul Ryan (Wisconsin Republican) and Sen. Ron Wyden (Oregon Democrat). Mrs. Steelman suggested allowing insurers to sell across state lines and making health savings accounts more accessible. Mr. Akin proposed dismantling the entire system of employer-based insurance to allow Americans to keep their coverage when changing jobs.\n\nThe debate saw a brief moment of direct attack when candidates were asked about which parts of the federal government they would like to eliminate. Mrs. Steelman criticized Mr. Akin for not cutting the Department of Education and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) budgets while serving in Washington. Mr. Akin responded by expressing his desire to eliminate these agencies but lamented the lack of support from fellow Democrats.\n\nDifferences emerged when the candidates were asked about handling the growing unrest in Syria. Mrs. Steelman and Mr. Brunner emphasized caution but were open to committing troops to the country, while Mr. Akin advocated for staying out of the \"no-win situation.\"\n\nOn Social Security, all three candidates agreed that the system should be preserved for current seniors but younger folks should be allowed to set up private savings accounts.\n\nFollowing the debate, Mrs. McCaskill's campaign released an email accusing all three candidates of favoring Wall Street investors over seniors.\n\nAccording to the latest polls, Mr. Brunner and Mr. Akin trail Mrs. Steelman, but all candidates beat Mrs. McCaskill in hypothetical matchups. Mr. Brunner and Mrs. Steelman did not exchange any blows, despite spending the past few weeks attacking each other.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Evaluating Nuclear Deal with Iran as Vice President Pence Discusses Iran's Nuclear Program and Missile Tests\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is currently evaluating whether to maintain the nuclear deal with Iran, Vice President Mike Pence stated in an interview with ABC News that aired on Sunday. The deal, which aims to halt Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions, was made between the Obama administration, Iran, and other world powers.\n\nVice President Pence expressed his disapproval of the agreement, stating that it allows Iran to develop a nuclear weapon in the years ahead and received hundreds of millions of dollars in cash in exchange. When asked about the future of the deal, Pence said, \"We're evaluating that as we speak.\"\n\nLast week, the U.S. imposed renewed sanctions on Iran following the country's ballistic missile tests, which are considered a violation of international norms. Top Democrats, including Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, have joined the White House in condemning the tests.\n\nIn a separate interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Senator Feinstein stated, \"I think Iran is wrong on this.\"\n\nRegarding the potential reimposition of economic sanctions, House Speaker Paul Ryan seemed to indicate that it would be difficult to undo the deal entirely, particularly when it comes to reinstating multilateral economic sanctions that were lifted as part of the agreement. Speaker Ryan told NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" \"A lot of that toothpaste is already out of the tube. I never supported the deal in the first place. I thought it was a huge mistake. But the multilateral sanctions are done.\" He added, \"I don't think you're going to go back and reconstitute the multilateral sanctions that were in place.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Debate over Boko Haram Designation and Response, 2012-2013\n\nArticle:\n\nIn mid-2012, a debate unfolded behind the scenes at the U.S. State Department regarding the definition of the Boko Haram threat and the appropriate response to the escalating violence in Nigeria, Africa's top oil-producing nation. According to several analysts and officials who spoke anonymously with The Times, there was resistance to adding Boko Haram to Washington's official terrorist organizations lists due to concerns that such a designation would boost the group's global standing and facilitate its growth and recruitment.\n\nIn June 2012, the State Department designated three Boko Haram leaders as \"global terrorists\" with \"close links\" to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). However, the Obama administration continued to resist labeling the entire group as a global terrorist organization, despite mounting evidence that Boko Haram was gaining access to military hardware such as rocket-propelled grenades through jihadist smuggling networks in Mali and Libya.\n\nAlternatively, the administration seemed to be supporting a strategy, pushed during 2012 by Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, to create an amnesty program that would offer Boko Haram members the opportunity to avoid prosecution in exchange for laying down their weapons. This approach, which had been successful in curbing militant activity in Nigeria's Christian south during the late-2000s, yielded no significant results in the predominantly Muslim north.\n\nThe situation in Northern Nigeria became increasingly dire, with the Nigerian security forces being implicated in \"serious human rights violations\" such as execution-style killings of detainees, according to a Human Rights Watch report in October 2013. This report, along with the deteriorating situation in Northern Nigeria, served as a backdrop for the State Department's sudden move in November 2013 to officially designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organization, ending a heated debate over the group's status.\n\nThe recent kidnapping of more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls by Boko Haram has brought renewed attention to the group's activities. It remains to be seen whether the dispatching of U.S. and British officials to aid Nigerian authorities in attempting to rescue the girls will lead to a deeper U.S. involvement in the situation.",
    " Title: House Speaker Pelosi Suggests Rescheduling or Written State of the Union Address Amid Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington, D.C. - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has requested President Donald Trump to reschedule his State of the Union address this month if the ongoing government shutdown persists, or to deliver it in writing. In a letter to Trump on Wednesday, Pelosi suggested an alternative date of January 29th for the written address.\n\nThe current government shutdown, now in its 26th day, marks the longest in U.S. history. The impasse stems from Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, a proposal that Democrats oppose.\n\nPelosi's letter cited the designation of State of the Union addresses as a \"National Special Security Event,\" which requires a high level of security. The Secret Service, responsible for such events, is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which is affected by the shutdown.\n\nPelosi argued that the State of the Union requires hundreds of people to work out logistics and security, most of whom have been furloughed or are working without pay due to the shutdown. Trump, according to Pelosi, could deliver the speech from the Oval Office if he wished.\n\nIn response, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy stated that Trump \"has a right\" to give the speech and that Americans \"have the right\" to hear it. McCarthy criticized Pelosi, stating, \"I think Speaker Pelosi is playing politics like I\u2019ve never seen a speaker before.\"\n\nWritten State of the Union-type addresses were once common practice. The nation's first two presidents, George Washington and John Adams, delivered annual messages to Congress in person. Thomas Jefferson, who succeeded Washington, began submitting his messages in writing in 1801, a practice that continued for over a century.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson revived the practice of in-person speeches in 1913. The U.S. Constitution mandates that presidents \"shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union,\" remarks formally known as the \"Annual Message\" for decades. President Franklin Roosevelt began describing the speeches as the \"state of the Union,\" a term officially adopted in 1947 during Harry Truman's administration.\n\nThe last president to submit only a written State of the Union was lame-duck Jimmy Carter in January 1981, four days before he left office.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump met with the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of House members, to discuss the shutdown. The day before, a moderate group of House Democrats declined Trump's invitation to a White House luncheon, viewing it as an attempt to bypass Pelosi as Trump tries to win support for funding for the border wall.\n\nSeven Democrats were among the Problem Solvers who met with Trump on Wednesday: Reps. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, Thomas Suozzi of New York, Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, Anthony Brindisi of New York, Dean Phillips of Minnesota, Max Rose of New York, and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Democrats expressed their agreement that the government must be reopened and that the shutdown is compromising security, safety, and the economy, causing suffering for millions of families. They stated that, once the government is reopened, there is a possibility to work together and find common ground to address the country's toughest problems.\n\nThe names of the Republican House members who attended the meeting have not been released. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders described the meeting as \"constructive.\"",
    " Title: Betsy DeVos Selected as Education Secretary, Nikki Haley Named U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump selected Betsy DeVos, a charter school advocate and GOP donor from Michigan, to be the education secretary on Wednesday. DeVos becomes the second woman chosen to fill a spot in Trump's Cabinet. Earlier in the day, Trump named South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Both Cabinet-level positions require Senate confirmation.\n\nWhile some initially cheered Haley's selection despite her limited experience on the international stage, the DeVos choice faced criticism even before it was formally announced. Conservatives warned that DeVos, a longtime Republican donor, previously supported the Common Core education standards that Trump railed against during the campaign.\n\nTrump, who was at his Palm Beach estate for the Thanksgiving holiday, called DeVos \"a brilliant and passionate education advocate.\" DeVos, from Michigan, is a longtime advocate for charter schools and school vouchers. She currently leads the advocacy group, American Federation for Children, and sits on the board of the Jeb Bush-led Foundation for Excellence in Education.\n\n\"Under her leadership, we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families,\" Trump said. DeVos said in her own statement, \"The status quo in education is not acceptable.\"\n\nThe DeVos family has been active in Republican politics for decades, especially as donors to GOP candidates and the Republican Party. DeVos' husband, Dick, is an heir to the Amway fortune and a former president of the company. The couple gave $22.5 million to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington in 2010, at the time the largest private donation in the center's history.\n\nHours before the DeVos pick was announced, conservative policy leader Frank Cannon, president of American Principles Project, called her \"an establishment, pro-Common Core secretary of education.\"\n\n\"This would not qualify as 'draining the swamp,'\" Cannon said, referencing Trump's campaign trail slogan. \"And it seems to fly in the face of what Trump has stated on education policy up to this point.\"\n\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said DeVos \"has no meaningful experience in the classroom or in our schools.\"\n\n\"The president-elect, in his selection of Betsy DeVos, has chosen the most ideological, anti-public education nominee put forward since President Carter created a Cabinet-level Department of Education,\" Weingarten said. \"In nominating DeVos, Trump makes it loud and clear that his education policy will focus on privatizing, defunding, and destroying public education in America.\"\n\nFormer presidential contender and Florida Governor Jeb Bush called DeVos \"an outstanding pick\" for the position.\n\n\"She has a long and distinguished history championing the right of all parents to choose schools that best ensure their children\u2019s success,\" he said in a statement.\n\nWhen asked about DeVos' support for the Common Core standards, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said \"the president-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core.\"\n\n\"Anybody joining the administration is signing on to the president-elect's platform and vision for moving America forward,\" Miller said.\n\nHaley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, is the only minority member chosen by Trump so far. Retired neurosurgeon and Trump loyalist, Ben Carson, an African-American, has been offered the job of secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to a person familiar with the offer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the deliberations publicly. Carson has not yet accepted the offer, but he tweeted on Wednesday that \"an announcement is forthcoming about my role in helping to make America great again.\"\n\nTrump said that Haley, his UN choice, \"has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country.\"\n\n\"She is also a proven dealmaker, and we look to be making plenty of deals,\" he said in a statement. \"She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham praised his home-state governor as a good choice and said in a statement that he looks forward to working with her on \"overdue reforms of the United Nations.\" Graham is chairman of the Senate's Foreign Operations Subcommittee on Appropriations, which is responsible for funding the UN and all American foreign assistance.\n\nHaley said she accepted the assignment partly out of \"a sense of duty.\"\n\n\"When the president believes you have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation, and to our nation's standing in the world, that is a calling that is important to heed,\" she said in a statement.\n\nNot all presidents have treated the ambassadorship to the U.N. as a Cabinet-level position, and Republicans have tended not to grant that status. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Trump is \"spending significant time\" weighing his choice for secretary of state. Among those he has interviewed is 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who repeatedly denounced Trump during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAfter secretary of state, the UN ambassador is the highest-profile diplomatic position, often serving as the voice for U.S. positions on the international stage. As part of the Cabinet, Haley would have more opportunity to shape U.S. policies, rather than simply defend the administration's positions.\n\nYet it could be an awkward role at times. Trump campaigned on the theme of \"America first\" and said he is skeptical about \"international unions that tie us up and bring America down.\" Trump has also described the United Nations as weak and incompetent.\n\nHaley would be the third consecutive female U.S. ambassador to the UN, after Susan Rice and Samantha Power, the current ambassador. Bad blood between Trump and Haley was evident through much of the campaign.\n\n\"The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!\" Trump wrote on Twitter in March. Haley denounced several of Trump's campaign comments and urged voters to \"reject the siren call of the angriest voices.\" She told The Associated Press in July, \"A lot of the things he has said are very off-putting and concerning.\"",

This represents a significant increase from a single-point difference last week.\n\nClinton's gain also comes after a series of controversial comments made by the Republican nominee this past week regarding the family of a fallen American soldier and Trump's suggestion that Russian hackers should seek out deleted Clinton emails. The Republican National Convention did not result in a post-convention bounce for Trump.\n\nIn a four-way general election match-up against Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton now leads Trump by 5 points \u2014 43 percent to 38 percent. This is a lead-reversal from last week, when Trump was beating the Democratic nominee by 2 points. Support for Johnson (9 points) and Stein (4 points) remained virtually unchanged from last week.\n\nThese results are according to the latest NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking poll conducted online from July 25 through July 31 among 12,742 adults who say they are registered to vote.\n\nPerhaps a result of a series of well-received speeches from high-profile Democrats, Clinton's gains this week were not only in the horserace numbers. Overall, the number of voters who say they have a strongly favorable impression of the Democratic nominee is up 5 points \u2014 from 15 percent to 20 percent \u2014 since the question was asked two weeks ago.\n\nClinton's favorability among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters rose from 74 percent two weeks ago to 80 percent this week. Her unfavorable rating also dropped among Democrats from 24 percent to 19 percent.\n\nPresident Obama, who spoke at the convention last week, also got an increase in approval this week. His job approval rating is up 3 points \u2014 52 percent approve this week compared to 49 percent last week.\n\nAfter a contentious primary season, the convention offered Democrats the chance to unite as a party. Overall, most voters who watched or followed the convention did not view the Democratic Party more favorably as a result \u2014 27 percent viewed the Democratic Party more favorably as a result of the convention, but 35 percent viewed the party less favorably, and 37 percent said their opinion of the Democratic Party didn't change.\n\nAmong Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, half said they have a more favorable opinion of the Democratic Party as a result of the convention. Among Independent voters, 42 percent said they view the Democratic Party less favorably, and 49 percent said the convention did not change their opinion. These results are similar to the favorability ratings we saw for the Republican Party last week following the GOP convention.\n\nOverall, four in ten voters said they were more interested in this year's Democratic National Convention compared to previous years. Among Democrats, 58 percent said they were more interested in this year's convention than in prior years. Roughly the same number of Republicans said that about the GOP convention last week. Among Independents, 46 percent said they had about the same level of interest this year as in previous years, and 34 percent said they were less interested this year.\n\nA strong Democratic convention combined with Trump's troubles over the past few days surrounding his tweets toward the Khan family and comments about Russia produced a very good bounce for Clinton. The question is whether the bounce is short-lived or represents a more permanent shift in the race.\n\nThe NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking poll was conducted online July 25 through July 31, 2016, among a national sample of 12,742 adults who say they are registered to vote. Respondents for this non-probability survey were selected from the nearly three million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform each day. Results have an error estimate of plus or minus 1.2 percentage points. For full results and methodology, click here.",
    " Title: Berlin Christmas Market Attack: Suspect Identified, Perpetrator Remains at Large\n\nArticle:\n\nThe manhunt for the perpetrator of an Islamic State-claimed attack on a Christmas market in Berlin continued Tuesday as German police cautioned that \"we may still have a dangerous criminal out there.\" The attack on the market outside Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church on Monday resulted in at least 12 fatalities and over 50 injuries after a truck plowed through a crowd at the market.\n\nInvestigators are treating the incident as an act of terrorism, according to Peter Frank, the country's top prosecutor. ISIS, through its media arm, claimed responsibility for the massacre and referred to the attacker as a \"soldier of the Islamic State,\" a typical phrase used by the group when an assailant has been inspired but not directed.\n\nInitially, a man, identified as a Pakistani citizen who arrived in Germany last year, was in custody based on a description of a man who jumped out of the truck and fled after the attack. However, federal prosecutors stated late Tuesday that he denied any involvement and they found no forensic evidence proving he was in the cab during the rampage. Additionally, no witnesses had followed him from the scene to the spot where he was picked up.\n\nPolice sources told Germany's Die Welt newspaper that they had the \"wrong man\" and that the true perpetrator \"is still armed, at large, and can cause fresh damage.\" Berlin police chief Klaus Kandt echoed this sentiment, stating, \"We may still have a dangerous criminal out there.\"\n\nThe method used in the attack bore similarities to the truck attack in Nice, France, in July, and the new \"modus operandi\" used by Islamic extremist groups, according to Frank. For this reason, he said, they are \"naturally on high alert and are investigating in all directions.\"\n\nSix out of the 12 people killed have been identified and are all Germans, but the identity of the other six remains unknown. Berlin police urged people to remain \"particularly vigilant\" and to report \"suspicious movement\" to a special hotline.\n\nIn related news, the German government increased police presence and cleared jail cells in preparation for New Year's Eve celebrations. The attack came less than a month after the U.S. State Department called for caution in markets and other public places across Europe, citing the focus of extremist groups including Islamic State and Al Qaeda on the upcoming holiday season and associated events.\n\nThe Islamic State and Al Qaeda have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack crowds. On July 14, a truck plowed into Bastille Day revelers in the southern French city of Nice, killing 86 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. No group had claimed responsibility for the Berlin attack as of early Tuesday.\n\nThe revelations about the attacker's identity are likely to add to the pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose decision to accept waves of migrants from Africa and the Middle East has been a contentious issue. In a Tuesday press conference, Merkel expressed her shock, shock, and deep sadness over the attack. She also stated that it would be \"particularly sickening\" if it was confirmed the attack was carried out by an asylum-seeker who sought refuge in Germany.\n\nThe truck's owner, Ariel Zurawski, was asked by German authorities to identify the driver from photos. Zurawski, the victim's cousin, described the driver's final moments, stating, \"It was really clear that he was fighting for his life. His face was swollen and bloodied. Police informed me that he had suffered gunshot wounds. Despite being stabbed, he was shot dead.\"\n\nThe investigation into the attack is ongoing, with federal prosecutors handling the case. The United States has offered assistance in the investigation and response. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has blamed Islamic extremists for the attack, but the assessment's basis remains unclear. Germany has not experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by ISIS.",
    " Title: Trump Mocks Christine Blasey Ford at Mississippi Rally, Draws Criticism from Senators\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a lively campaign-style rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump mocked Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who testified last week at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.\n\nDuring the rally, Trump mimicked Ford's testimony, in which she vividly described a violent sexual assault she alleges Kavanaugh committed against her in the early 1980s, while admitting that certain details of the time and place were lost to memory.\n\nRepublican Senator Jeff Flake, a key member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called Trump's remarks \"kind of appalling\" on Wednesday. Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least 20 women, whose allegations he has denied and dismissed. Last week, he called Ford a \"very credible witness\" and said, \"I thought her testimony was very compelling and she looks like a very fine woman to me, very fine woman.\"\n\nAt the rally, the president mocked Ford's testimony with a question-and-answer routine that brought cheers from the crowd in Southaven, Mississippi.\n\n\"How did you get home?\" Trump said, echoing a question Ford was asked by the committee. \"I don't remember,\" the president said.\n\n\"How did you get there?\" 'I don't remember.' Where is the place?\" 'I don't remember.' How many years ago was it?\" 'I don't know.' What neighborhood was it?\" 'I don't know.' Where's the house?\" 'I don't know.\"\n\nTrump concluded the routine by lamenting the personal cost to Kavanaugh of Ford's allegations and by insinuating that Ford was part of a partisan conspiracy. \"They destroy people, these are really evil people,\" Trump said.\n\nSenator Flake, who triggered an FBI investigation of Kavanaugh last Friday, said on NBC, \"To discuss something this sensitive at a political rally is just not right. It's just not right, and I wish he had not done it.\"\n\nFlake made his about-face having signaled moments earlier that he would vote to approve Kavanaugh outright, then huddling in frantic negotiations with Democrats on the committee. He has since continued his strong stance of questioning Kavanaugh's nomination.\n\nOn Tuesday night after the remarks, Michael Bromwich, a member of Ford's legal team, condemned \"a vicious, vile and soulless attack.\"\n\n\"Is it any wonder that she was terrified to come forward, and that other sexual assault survivors are as well?\" Bromwich said on Twitter. \"She is a remarkable profile in courage. He is a profile in cowardice.\"\n\nLast week's day of drama had followed an extraordinary hearing by the committee the day before when Kavanaugh and Ford gave dueling testimony about a party in their high school years at which Ford says the then 17-year-old Kavanaugh attempted to rape her, when she was 15. He furiously disputed the account in an emotional and partisan display.\n\nIn contrast to Trump's portrayal on Tuesday evening, Ford accurately placed multiple people in Kavanaugh's contemporaneous social circle, as established by his archived calendars from the era, at the scene, and gave a clear account of the alleged attack itself.\n\nIn her testimony, she said, \"I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.\"\n\nKavanaugh is Trump's second pick to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. The confirmation process for Trump's first pick, Neil Gorsuch, proceeded to a vote without significant controversy.\n\nHowever, Kavanaugh has been waylaid by accusations of sexual assault by Ford and two other women who have spoken out publicly, and by doubts about his testimony before the Senate, which included conspiracy-mongering and dubious descriptions of his high school and college years.\n\nSpeaking under oath before the Senate committee, Kavanaugh denied any drinking problem and denied bragging about sexual conquests in a high school yearbook entry. Former classmates have since stepped forward to say that Kavanaugh was a frequent drunk. The New York Times on Tuesday published a handwritten letter by Kavanaugh instructing friends participating in an upcoming holiday rental to \"warn the neighbors that we're loud, obnoxious drunks with prolific pukers among us.\"\n\nIn testimony last Thursday, Ford described attending a house party in the Washington DC suburbs in the early 1980s at which she was pushed into a bedroom where a drunk Kavanaugh held her down, groped her, tried to strip her, and left her fearing for her life. Ford told the Senate she was \"100%\" certain that he was her attacker, while Kavanaugh said he was \"100%\" certain he was not.",
    " Title: Obama Vows Continued Executive Action, Announces Partnerships with Businesses and Education Institutions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the concluding days of a busy week, President Obama, in his weekly address on Saturday, pledged to continue taking executive action wherever possible and to seek new partners outside Washington to help him achieve his goals.\n\n\"Wherever I can take steps to expand opportunity for more families on my own, I will,\" the president said. \"I'm going to ask business leaders, education leaders, and philanthropic leaders to partner with us to advance these goals.\"\n\nThis commitment is part of the president's \"year of action,\" during which he has demonstrated his intention to work with CEOs, higher education institutions, and others to accomplish his aims.\n\nOn Friday, for instance, the president announced a new agreement with over 300 businesses, including some of America's top companies such as Apple, AT&T, Ford, and others, to aid the long-term unemployed. Under the deal, companies will place less emphasis on the length of time a job applicant has been out of work and less importance on credit histories.\n\nThis agreement is part of a larger effort to get the long-term jobless back into the workforce while an extension of unemployment benefits remains stalled in Congress.\n\nIn addition, the president has used executive power to raise the minimum wage for all federal contractors from $7.25 to $10.10, established new government-backed, interest-bearing retirement accounts for all American workers, and taken other steps.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill have countered the president's executive actions by proposing pieces of legislation that they believe both sides of the aisle should support.\n\nFor example, Rep. Gregg Harper (Mississippi Republican) pointed to a bill that would eliminate public funding for political party conventions and use those dollars to fund pediatric research at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\"We can't fix it all, but surely creating a lifetime of hope and opportunity for our most vulnerable kids is more important than subsidizing week-long political pep rallies,\" Mr. Harper added.\n\nOther Republican responses to the president's weekly address included Rep. Martha Roby of Alabama, who highlighted a measure that would allow workers in the private sector to use their overtime toward paid time off, and Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana, who called on the president to support legislation consolidating federal training programs and strengthening federal partnerships with community colleges.\n\nRepublicans believe these bills and others can help spur new cooperation with the president this year and slow down what looks to be a wave of executive actions.\n\n\"We believe that this can be a year of bipartisan action, a moment when speeches give way to solutions,\" said Rep. Fred Upton (Michigan Republican and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee). \"The American people never let us down, and we can not let them down either.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates and the Question of Free Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article do not represent the views of Townhall.com.\n\nThe article discusses the issue of free speech in the context of the current race for the Democratic nomination, comparing it to a police state and Maoist tribunals. The article argues that some Democratic candidates have been required to apologize for statements that are considered politically incorrect, and that this is a form of authoritarianism and \"woke\" fascism.\n\nThe article mentions Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Al Sharpton. It notes that Buttigieg was criticized for saying \"all lives matter,\" O'Rourke was criticized for a joke about his wife, and Gillibrand was criticized for expressing sympathy for the idea of a closed border. All three have since apologized for their statements.\n\nThe article also mentions Al Sharpton and his tax-exempt organization, which the Democratic candidates have recently visited to express support for race-based reparations. The article questions the candidates' silence during the mid-1990s when Sharpton was denouncing a Jewish landlord in Harlem, leading to the firebombing of his store and the deaths of eight people.\n\nThe article concludes by questioning whether the country wants to live in a society where such people have political power, where humor and dissent are criminal acts, where lying is the currency of public life, and where authorities can destroy individuals for thinking the wrong things. The article compares this to the social media platform Twitter and imagines a scenario where Twitter had control of the U.S. military.\n\nThe article does not provide a clear answer to the question it poses, but rather presents a critical view of the current state of free speech in the Democratic Party and the potential consequences of allowing authoritarianism to take hold.",
    " Title: Ryan's Voting Decisions on Fiscal Cliff and Sandy Relief Bills Spark Political Speculation\n\nArticle:\n\nRepresentative Paul Ryan, a key figure in the Republican Party, has recently found himself at the center of political speculation following his votes on two significant bills. On Tuesday, Ryan voted against most of his GOP House colleagues and with President Obama to raise taxes on wealthy Americans and increase the national debt by an estimated $4 trillion. In a separate vote, Ryan opposed a bill that would allow the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to take on $9.7 billion in new debt to aid those affected by superstorm Sandy.\n\nRyan's vote against the Sandy relief bill was less surprising, as he had previously spoken out against some of the extraneous items in the legislation. In a statement on Friday, he stated, \"It would be irresponsible to raise an insolvent program's debt ceiling without making the necessary reforms.\"\n\nIn a statement after the bill's passage, Ryan expressed his stance on the fiscal cliff, stating, \"We'll never get our debt under control unless we tackle its main drivers: too little economic growth and too much spending.\" He added that it was time to \"return our attention to the real problem: out-of-control spending.\"\n\nThe two votes could potentially impact Ryan's political future, particularly if he decides to run for president in 2016. The fiscal cliff vote could become an issue, especially if his potential opponent, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, highlights the fact that Ryan voted for the measure while Rubio voted against it. The Sandy vote could also be a point of contention if his rival is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who criticized members of his own party this week for not voting on a $60 billion Sandy relief package.\n\nRepublican strategist Ron Bonjean suggested that the votes could be politically manageable for Ryan. \"Looking through the 2016 primary lens, I think he can easily explain voting yes to avert the fiscal cliff, meant to protect 98 percent of taxpayers, and the issue of Hurricane Sandy, designed to save taxpayers money,\" Bonjean said. He added that if the bill had gone through the regular House committee process, there would be no possibility of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\nRyan has been known to maintain a low profile during negotiations, letting House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor be the faces of the fight. However, Ryan's spokesperson, Kevin Seifert, stated that Ryan's votes were simply a matter of him voting his conscience.\n\nThe two votes in 2016 may mean nothing or could potentially haunt Ryan if he decides to run for president. The outcome will depend on the political landscape at the time and the candidates vying for the nomination.",
    " Title: Fox News Remains Silent on Twitter Amidst Boycott, Third Week of Absence\n\nArticle:\n\nFox News, a prominent American cable news network, has not tweeted since November 8, marking the third week of its absence from the social media platform. The network, which launched its new subscription streaming service Fox Nation on Tuesday, did not use its Twitter feed, capable of reaching 18.3 million followers, to announce the launch.\n\nThe network's silence follows a silent protest against Twitter, initiated after a group of demonstrators posted the home address of star host Tucker Carlson on the social network. The boycott also includes the Fox Business Network Twitter feed, as well as a few other official Fox News feeds.\n\nThe reasons behind Fox News' avoidance of Twitter and the intended outcomes of the boycott remain unclear. However, owner Rupert Murdoch, who has expressed frustration with social media platforms like Twitter in the past, is believed to be a significant factor. Murdoch argues that these platforms benefit greatly from news publishers' content without offering enough in return.\n\nAccording to analytics tracker SimilarWeb, 1.4 percent of FoxNews.com's traffic in October came from Twitter, while nearly 70 percent came from direct clicks on the site. Raju Narisetti, a Columbia Journalism School professor and former senior vice president at Murdoch's company, News Corp, stated that Twitter is not a significant revenue issue for Fox News.\n\nStaff members within Fox News describe the current mood as \"talking and confused.\" Some believe the boycott would have ended by now, particularly with the Fox Nation launch. However, the standoff's resolution remains uncertain.\n\nThe network's silence stems from frustration over Twitter's response to the harassment of Carlson, according to a Mediaite report that Fox News has not disputed. A Washington anti-fascist group had posted his address on the platform, leading a group of people to assemble outside his home and shout threats. After news reports, Twitter removed the offending tweets and suspended the group's account.\n\nWhile some hosts, including Carlson, also stopped tweeting, others, including his prime-time colleagues Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity, have continued. The network's silence and the ongoing boycott have raised questions about the publicity they are losing with the Fox Nation launch.\n\nFox News and Twitter declined to comment for this story. The network's relationship with Twitter, while not generating significant traffic, is still valuable due to the presence of influential accounts. The analytics support this view, with Comscore finding similar results to SimilarWeb.\n\nDespite the ongoing boycott, some are surprised that Fox News did not leverage its 18 million Twitter followers to promote the Fox Nation launch. The network's absence from Twitter, according to some, is a \"hell of a lot easier\" when Twitter is more of a \"pain in the ass\" than a benefit for the organization.",
    " Title: Media Matters President's Past Offensive Online Posts Come to Light\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent report by Daily Caller News Foundation reporter Peter Hasson, it has been revealed that the president of Media Matters, Angelo Carusone, has a history of inflammatory and offensive statements on his now-defunct blog. The posts, which include derogatory remarks about transgender individuals, Bangladeshis, Jews, and other groups, have sparked controversy and criticism.\n\nOne particularly offensive post, titled \"Tranny Paradise,\" was written by Carusone in November 2005. In this post, Carusone criticized a news article that described a gang of transvestites as \"attractive.\" He wrote, \"Did you notice the word attractive? What the f*ck is that doing there? Is the writer a tranny lover too? Or, perhaps he\u2019s trying to justify how these trannies tricked this Bangladeshi in the first place?\"\n\nCarusone also criticized the police for not advising the public to stay away from \"tranny bars\" and other places. He wrote, \"And while we\u2019re out, what the hell was he doing with $7,300 worth of stuff. The guy\u2019s Banladeshi!\"\n\nThese are just a few examples of Carusone's offensive posts. Readers can find the full report by Peter Hasson to get a complete understanding of Carusone's controversial views.\n\nThe revelation of Carusone's past offensive comments has sparked debate and criticism on social media, with some people expressing outrage and others questioning the hypocrisy of the media and political world. It remains to be seen how Carusone and Media Matters will respond to the controversy.\n\nIn the past, similar revelations of offensive comments have been met with a range of responses, from apologies and public statements of regret to dismissals and denials. It is unclear at this time how Carusone and Media Matters will respond to the controversy.\n\nThe controversy highlights the ongoing debate about free speech and the role of offensive comments in public discourse. Some argue that offensive comments should be tolerated as a necessary part of free expression, while others argue that such comments have no place in public discourse and can cause harm to marginalized communities.\n\nRegardless of one's position on the issue, the controversy surrounding Carusone's past comments is a reminder of the importance of careful and thoughtful speech, particularly when it comes to issues of race, gender, and identity. It is also a reminder of the need for transparency and accountability in the media and political world, and the importance of holding individuals and organizations to the same standards of behavior and speech.",
    " Title: Trump Releases Second Budget Prioritizing Defense and Immigration Enforcement, Seeking $3 Trillion in Deficit Reduction Over a Decade\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has unveiled his second budget on Monday, outlining an aggressive set of spending reforms aimed at reducing the deficit by $3 trillion over a decade. The budget, according to a preview released by the White House on Sunday, prioritizes defense spending and immigration enforcement, while minimizing funding for services that American families rely on.\n\nThe budget proposal, as stated by White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney, aims to \"fund what we must, cut where we can, and reduce what we borrow.\" The budget choices, however, have been met with criticism, with critics arguing that the language of \"hard choices\" is misleading, as the budget prioritizes spending on defense and immigration enforcement at the expense of middle- and working-class families.\n\nThe budget includes a significant boost to the Pentagon to allow for a \"ready, larger, and more lethal military,\" according to the White House preview. Additionally, the budget allocates funds for border security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's ability to detain and imprison immigrants. While Trump is discussing spending some money on the opioid crisis, his approach leans more towards law enforcement rather than treatment and recovery.\n\nIt is important to note that the budget's emphasis on \"hard choices\" is contingent on Republicans' previous decision to grant corporations and wealthy individuals a substantial tax break, which has contributed to the deficit. This tax cut, according to some analysts, has made the budget's spending choices more challenging.",
    " Title: Democratic Senator Apologizes to Republican Colleague for Criticism of Police Reform Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin apologized to Senator Tim Scott, the Senate's only black Republican, for dismissing Scott's police reform bill as \"a token, half-hearted approach.\" According to a statement from Durbin's communications director, Emily Hampsten, Durbin's criticism was not directed at Scott's bill but at the Senate Majority Leader for prematurely ending the debate on the issue.\n\nDuring a floor speech on Wednesday, Durbin, the Senate minority whip, criticized the GOP police reform bill, which was introduced by Scott in response to demands for action on police brutality and racism following the police custody death of George Floyd. Durbin expressed a need for more comprehensive changes to address systemic racism and policing in America.\n\nIn response to Durbin's remarks, Scott, a South Carolina Republican, tweeted later in the day, \"Y'all still wearing those kente cloths over there @SenatorDurbin?\" The tweet referenced about two dozen Senate Democrats who earlier this month donned African kente cloths and knelt in the Capitol's Emancipation Hall to express solidarity with black Americans. Durbin did not participate in that display.\n\nScott also said the comments from Durbin, who in the same floor speech called Scott a friend and said he respected him, \"hurt my soul.\" In an emotional floor speech, Scott reminded members that Wednesday was the five-year anniversary of the shooting at Emanuel AME Church by a white male who expressed racist views against African-Americans.\n\nThe details regarding whether Durbin will further address the matter or if Scott responds are unavailable at this time.",

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) on Thursday night released two additional batches of \"committee confidential\" documents from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's work for former President George W. Bush. The documents, totaling 26 pages, are marked \"committee confidential,\" meaning they have not been cleared for public release or discussion.\n\nBooker, who has been a vocal critic of Kavanaugh's nomination, announced the latest release of the emails in a tweet, stating, \"Here are two additional 'committee confidential' documents that have been kept out of public view until now.\"\n\nA spokesman for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, confirmed that the documents' \"committee confidential\" classification remains in effect. The releases bring the total tranches of \"confidential\" documents released by Booker to five.\n\nIn one four-page tranche released on Thursday night, Kavanaugh is attempting to set up a meeting with Manny Miranda, a then-GOP Senate aide who was involved in hacking Democratic files. Kavanaugh has been questioned about his knowledge of Miranda's actions.\n\nIn a second 22-page tranche released on Thursday evening, Kavanaugh forwards an op-ed in 2003 that describes Roe v. Wade as a \"bad law.\" He adds, \"Interesting piece from Stephen Carter, who is not conservative.\"\n\nThe releases come after Booker sparked a heated debate earlier in the day when he warned during a Judiciary Committee hearing that he would be releasing \"confidential\" information. Booker has defended his decision, arguing the document process set up by Republicans on the Judiciary panel is a \"sham.\"\n\nHowever, his move has drawn criticism from Republicans who implied that he was breaking Senate rules in an effort to bolster potential 2020 White House ambitions. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said to Booker, \"Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Republican National Committee (RNC) criticized Booker's actions, stating, \"Senator Cory Booker boldly declared he is knowingly violating Senate rules.\" The spokesman added, \"30 minutes after his grandstanding for the cameras, Booker says he didn\u2019t violate any Senate rules.\"",
    " Title: Trump Hires Rudy Giuliani to Bolster Legal Team, Focuses on Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has hired Rudy Giuliani, a vocal supporter, to bolster his legal team. Giuliani, who served as a U.S. attorney before becoming the mayor of New York City, will reportedly focus on the Russia probe as the White House aims to conclude the president's involvement with the investigation.\n\nTrump's personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, stated that Giuliani will primarily work on the Russia probe. During a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday, President Trump expressed a desire to bring the investigation to a close, stating, \"We want to get the investigation over with, done with, put it behind us and we have to get back to business.\"\n\nIn recent days, President Trump has shown a more relaxed attitude towards the investigation, suggesting he has put the idea of firing special counsel Robert Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of the Russia probe, on hold. Last week, Rosenstein reportedly informed the president that he is not a target of any part of the special counsel's investigation or the probe into Trump's longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\nThe president has maintained transparency throughout the investigation, stating, \"As far as the investigation, nobody has ever been more transparent than I have \u2013 instructed our lawyers be totally transparent. I believe we've given them 1.4 million pages of documents if you can believe that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Justice, in response to subpoena threats from Republican lawmakers, has provided Congress with copies of several memos written by former FBI Director James Comey during his tenure. The memos detail accounts of meetings between President Trump and Comey before the latter was fired.\n\nComey, during an appearance on MSNBC, stated that he wrote the memos to have a record of his interactions with the president, as he believed Trump might not tell the truth about their conversations if they became an issue.\n\nIn a joint statement, the chairmen of three congressional committees noted that Comey's memos show President Trump requested that allegations of collusion, coordination, and conspiracy between his campaign and Russia be fully investigated. They also pointed out that Comey did not write about feeling obstructed or threatened during his conversations with the president.\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter to comment on the memos, stating, \"James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?\"\n\nThis development is the latest in an ongoing investigation that the White House is eager to see conclude.",
    " Title: ICE Enforcement Activities Increase Across U.S., Targeting Undocumented Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nOver the past five days, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have conducted an \"enforcement surge\" in various cities across the United States, resulting in the arrest of more than 160 undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles area alone. This increase in enforcement activities has been reported in cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Charlotte, Austin, and others.\n\nImmigration advocates and lawyers have reported that ICE has increased its enforcement activities, including door-to-door visits in apartment buildings, in these cities. In Atlanta, for example, immigration attorney Sarah Owings stated that over 40 undocumented immigrants have been detained in the Savannah, Georgia, area over the past two days. Owings also reported that ICE officers visited two apartment complexes with high concentrations of Latino residents, asking everyone present for proof of legal U.S. residency.\n\nICE officials and the White House have stated that these activities are routine. However, immigration activists, lawyers, and members of Congress have expressed concern that this is a significant change in enforcement tactics. Owings described the current situation as ICE \"out and they\u2019re hunting.\"\n\nIn a statement, an ICE spokesperson criticized recent media coverage of the Los Angeles apprehensions, stating that reports of ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous, and irresponsible. On Feb. 9, an ICE official told reporters that reports of 100 arrests in the Los Angeles area that day were \"grossly exaggerated.\"\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-AZ) stated that among his fellow Democrats, there is \"not much\" confidence in ICE's statements. Bob Libal, the executive director of Grassroots Leadership, a group based in Austin that opposes immigrant detention and deportation, reported that about two dozen undocumented immigrants have been arrested by ICE agents on Feb. 9 and 10.\n\nImmigration activists have pointed to President Donald Trump's Jan. 25 executive order, \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\" as the impetus behind the enforcement surge. This executive order made upwards of 8 million undocumented immigrants top priorities for deportation.\n\nTrump has not kept all his immigration-crackdown campaign promises, such as undoing the temporary deportation protections that President Barack Obama made available to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nA staffer for a Democratic congressional office that frequently criticized the Obama administration's immigration enforcement practices stated that the recent surge in enforcement activities is uniquely concerning due to the number of arrests and the simultaneous nature of the operations in multiple cities. Some Hill Democrats worry that this could be the new normal.\n\n\"It will happen until the beds are full,\" the staffer said. \"They'll have to stop at some point, right?\"",
    " Title: Brazilian President Bolsonaro Accuses NGOs of Starting Amazon Fires, Amidst Increase in Deforestation and Fires\n\nArticle:\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has stated that his government lacks the resources to combat the thousands of fires currently burning in the Amazon rainforest. In a press conference, he suggested that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) may have started the fires as retaliation for his government's reduction in their funding, but admitted he has no evidence to support this claim.\n\nOn Thursday, President Bolsonaro was questioned about who was responsible for starting the fires. He responded, \"The Indians, do you want me to blame the Indians? Do you want me to blame the Martians?... Everyone is a suspect, but the biggest suspects are NGOs.\" When asked if there was any proof of this, he replied, \"Did I accuse NGOs directly? I just said I suspect them.\"\n\nThe increase in fires has been confirmed by satellite data published by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), which shows an 85% increase in fires across Brazil this year, with most occurring in the Amazon region. The Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, plays a crucial role in slowing down global warming as a vital carbon store.\n\nAt a meeting on climate change earlier this week, Brazil's Environment Minister Ricardo Salles was heckled. Climate activists and conservationists have been critical of the Bolsonaro government and its policies, which prioritize development over conservation. They argue that since President Bolsonaro took office, the Amazon rainforest has experienced accelerated degradation.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Amazon fires has escalated, with President Bolsonaro dismissing the latest data and blaming the \"queimada\" season, when farmers burn land to clear it before planting. However, Inpe has noted that the number of fires is not in line with those normally reported during the dry season.\n\nThe situation has sparked global concern, with millions taking to social media to express their concern using the hashtag #PrayForAmazonia. However, some of the most viral images shared on social media are not current, with some dating back to 1989 and others depicting fires in locations far from the Amazon.\n\nThe US space agency, Nasa, has reported that overall fire activity in the Amazon basin is slightly below average this year. The region is home to approximately three million species of plants and animals and one million indigenous people.\n\nThe plight of the Amazon has seen millions take to social media to decry reports of a massive yearly increase in forest fires. However, some of the most striking images shared by social media users are not all they seem. The hashtag #PrayForAmazonia started to be widely used on Tuesday and has been included in almost three million tweets since. The most widely shared tweet using that hashtag - with more than a million likes and retweets - includes two aerial images of forest fires, neither of which show the current situation.\n\nWildfires are common during the dry season in Brazil, but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching. \"The dry season creates the favorable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident,\" Inpe researcher Alberto Setzer told Reuters news agency.\n\nRicardo Mello, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Amazon Programme, said the fires were \"a consequence of the increase in deforestation seen in recent figures.\" This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year. After more satellite data was made accessible, it has been updated to reflect the fact the fires are instead the worst since 2010.",
    " Title: Trump Poised to Shape Supreme Court with Second Appointment\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump is set to appoint a new Supreme Court justice following the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a move that could cement conservative control of the court and potentially reshape divisive social issues.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kennedy announced his retirement, providing Trump with an opportunity to shape U.S. justice for decades to come. A senior White House official stated, \"This is a legacy.\" Trump himself, speaking at a rally in North Dakota on Wednesday night, emphasized the importance of the selection, saying, \"We have to pick a great one. We have to pick one that\u2019s going to be there for 40 years, 45 years.\"\n\nThe new justice could play a pivotal role in paring back abortion rights, potentially challenging the Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973 that established a constitutional right to obtain the procedure. Undoing or limiting this ruling has been a long-standing goal of conservative activists.\n\nAlthough Kennedy was a conservative justice, he was often considered the \"swing vote\" on the court due to his tendency to join with liberal justices on certain issues, including expanding gay rights and upholding abortion rights. By selecting a social conservative to replace Kennedy, Trump would have a reliable 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court, even on hot-button social issues.\n\nWhile Trump did not make rolling back abortion rights a central plank of his campaign, many conservative supporters want Roe v. Wade overturned, and Trump promised to appoint anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court. However, choosing an ultra-conservative nominee could pose risks, as Trump may need to rely on moderate Republicans to secure approval in the U.S. Senate, where his fellow Republicans hold a narrow majority.\n\nWhite House officials expect Trump to begin interviewing candidates from a list of 25 people, with the aim of getting the new justice confirmed by the Senate in the autumn. They believe this timeline could boost conservative voter enthusiasm and turnout at the November congressional elections, as Republicans fight to maintain control of both houses of Congress.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Supreme Court has handed Trump a series of victories in politically charged cases, including upholding his travel ban on people entering the United States from several majority-Muslim countries. The court's decisions, coupled with Kennedy's retirement, could embolden the administration's lawyers, who are facing legal challenges on multiple fronts, including over Trump's move to separate families who enter the United States illegally and his plan to rescind protections for \"Dreamers,\" young adults brought to the country illegally as children.\n\nAn open seat on the Supreme Court was an important factor in rallying conservatives behind Trump's presidential election campaign in 2016. Trump quickly delivered on that promise by selecting Neil Gorsuch, who has become one of the most conservative justices. Trump has also filled a record-breaking number of seats on the influential federal appeals courts and District Courts with the enthusiastic backing of the Senate. Trump appeared to be excited about the new opportunity to reshape the federal judiciary in a conservative direction.",
    " Title: Iowa Poll Shows President Trump Leading in Head-to-Head Matchups Against Warren and Biden, Sanders Ahead of Trump, Harris Struggles in Iowa\n\nArticle:\n\nA new Emerson College poll released this week shows President Donald Trump edging out Democrat frontrunners Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Joe Biden (D) in hypothetical general election matchups in Iowa. The poll, taken October 13-16, 2019, among 888 registered voters in Iowa, showed the president leading both Warren and Biden 51 percent to 49 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), however, appeared to hold an advantage in a hypothetical matchup, leading the president by two points, 51 percent to Trump's 49 percent.\n\nThe poll results indicate that Sanders' lead against the president comes despite the fact that he is not currently leading the Democrat field in Iowa. Instead, Warren and Biden are tied with 23 percent support each, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with 16 percent support. Sanders fell to fourth place with 13 percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D), Gov. Steve Bullock (D), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with 5 percent, 4 percent, and 3 percent, respectively.\n\nThe poll also showed some trouble for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who has been trying to revive her floundering campaign by focusing on Iowa. In September, Harris signaled a switch in campaign strategies, telling a colleague that she is \"f*cking moving to Iowa.\" Despite her efforts, she was only able to garner 2 percent support in the state, alongside Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Tom Steyer (D).\n\nThe poll also showed that more Iowans oppose impeachment than support it, 48 percent to 42 percent. Impeachment does not appear to be a top priority among Iowans, with only 6 percent considering it an important factor in choosing whom to support for president. Thirty-three percent said the economy, 19 percent said health care, and 10 percent chose \"social issues.\"\n\n\"The Democrats have some work to do in Iowa convincing voters that impeachment is a top priority of Congress; 67 percent of Democrats in Iowa support impeaching the president, but only 10 percent identify it as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president,\" Emerson Polling Director Spencer Kimball said.",
    " Title: Obama Compares Marijuana to Alcohol, Expresses Concern Over Disparities in Marijuana-Related Incarceration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with The New Yorker, President Barack Obama weighed in on the ongoing debate about marijuana legalization. Citing his personal experience with marijuana as a child, Obama stated that he views marijuana as a \"bad habit\" and a vice, not significantly more dangerous than alcohol or cigarettes.\n\nWhen asked whether marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol, the president, after a pause, responded that it is \"in terms of its impact on the individual consumer.\" However, he emphasized that he does not encourage marijuana use and has warned his daughters about the drug.\n\nOne issue that concerns Obama is the disproportionate incarceration rates of minorities and those in poverty for marijuana-related offenses. He noted the hypocrisy of individual users receiving long sentences while those who wrote the laws \"have probably done the same thing.\"\n\nRegarding the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington state, Obama expressed support, stating, \"It's important for it to go forward.\" He argued that it is crucial for society to avoid a situation where a large number of people have broken the law, but only a select few are punished.\n\nHowever, Obama cautioned against overstating the benefits of marijuana legalization, stating that the new laws in Colorado and Washington state will present challenges and could lead to tougher debates on harder drugs in the future. He raised the question of whether society would be open to the idea of legalizing other drugs if they could be calibrated to cause less harm than alcohol or tobacco.\n\nIn conclusion, President Obama has compared marijuana to alcohol and cigarettes in terms of individual consumer impact, but expressed concern over the disproportionate incarceration rates for marijuana-related offenses. He supports the legalization of marijuana in states like Colorado and Washington, but cautions against overstating the benefits and potential challenges that may arise from such legalization.",
    " Title: The Left's Historical Aversion to Fighting Major Evils: A Focus on Communism and Islamism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe article discusses the historical tendency of the political left to prioritize lesser or perceived evils over major, tangible threats. The author argues that during the Cold War, the left was more focused on opposing anti-Communism than fighting Communism itself, and this pattern is repeating with the current threat of totalitarian Islam, or Islamism.\n\nDuring the Cold War, many liberals and conservatives fought Communism, but the left opposed anti-Communism. The left regarded the Cold War as a mere conflict between two powers, rather than a battle against a significant evil. They criticized Ronald Reagan's labeling of the Soviet Union as an \"evil empire\" and often dismissed anti-Communist efforts as \"cold war\" mentality.\n\nIn the contemporary context, the left is similarly focused on fighting against anti-Islamists, rather than Islamists. The left labels those fighting Islamism as \"Islamophobes\" and \"racists,\" while ignoring the threat of totalitarian Islam. The author argues that, historically, the left has done more to enable Communist evil than to stop it, and the same holds true for Islamism.\n\nThe article suggests that the left's moral clarity lies not in fighting real evils, but in fighting perceived or lesser evils. The left's focus on fighting racism, sexism, and Nazis in America is criticized as misguided, given that America is the least racist multiracial society in history. The author argues that fighting Nazis in America in 2017 is an act of moral onanism, while fighting Nazis during the Nazi regime in Germany was an act of moral heroism.\n\nThe article also mentions that the left fights religious Americans, particularly religious Christian Americans, and conservatives who oppose their views. The left is also heavily involved in the fight against global warming. The author concludes by stating that the real fight against evil in the world today is not against carbon emissions, but against Islamism.\n\nThe article does not provide specific examples of the left's current actions against statues, but it suggests that the left is in the vanguard of fighting statues, despite being AWOL against Communism and Islamism. The author's argument is that the left prioritizes symbolic battles over real, tangible threats to society.",
    " Title: Congress to Vote on Keystone XL Pipeline Amidst Louisiana Senate Race\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo bills that authorize the construction of the contentious Keystone XL pipeline are set for a vote in Congress, as their sponsors, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), prepare for a runoff election on December 6 to determine the Senate seat winner.\n\nOn the Senate floor, Landrieu advocated for action on the Canada-to-Texas pipeline project, stating, \"I believe with a push we could actually get the votes that we need to pass the Keystone pipeline.\" Shortly after, Republican leaders in the House scheduled a vote for Thursday on a Keystone bill sponsored by Landrieu's rival, Cassidy.\n\nThe pipeline, developed by energy company TransCanada, would transport tar sands oil from Canada to Texas. It has been a divisive issue, with proponents arguing that it would create thousands of jobs, while opponents claim that tar sands oil is too costly and toxic to refine. While one side maintains that the plan would strengthen the energy industry, the other asserts it would increase greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nConcerned landowners along the pipeline's proposed path have also voiced their opposition, expressing concerns about property disruption and potential damage to farms, particularly in the event of a leak. In February, a Nebraska judge invalidated a 2012 law that allowed part of the pipeline to run through the state.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that the Obama administration is not favorable towards news of a vote on the matter:\n\n\"While the White House did not issue a direct veto threat, spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama holds a 'dim view' of legislative efforts to compel action on the project. Earnest reiterated Obama's preference for evaluating the pipeline through a long-stalled State Department review.\"",
    " Title: Vanessa Trump Speaks Out on Hospitalization After White Powder Incident Involving Donald Trump Jr.\n\nArticle:\n\nVanessa Trump, the ex-wife of Donald Trump Jr., has shared her account of a white powder incident that occurred last February, when she was rushed to the hospital after opening an envelope containing the substance. In a statement to Axios on Friday, she described the event as \"personal\" and a \"cowardly act.\"\n\n\"This is personal for me because I know firsthand what it is like to be targeted and terrorized by a coward with a vendetta,\" she said.\n\nAccording to her statement, she was hospitalized in New York City along with two other individuals who were present at the residence when she opened the envelope. She reportedly felt sick and started coughing after the incident. The authorities later identified the substance as cornstarch.\n\n\"I was rushed to the hospital, evaluated, and put on Cipro [an antibiotic] for the longest two weeks of my life, and while they worked to identify whether the white powder was deadly, I spent the entire time thinking about the horrifying possibility that I would never see my five beautiful children again,\" her statement reads.\n\n\"It was a cowardly act against a mother. And even today, every time I open the mail, I feel the same fear in my heart as I did that day,\" she added.\n\nTrump, who is soon to divorce from her husband with whom she shares five children, condemned the recent bomb scares against prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"These recent acts are the acts of a coward and nothing more than terrorism, pure and simple. No one, regardless of political party or ideology, should ever have to go through what I went through,\" Trump said.\n\nIn response to his ex-wife's statement, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted, \"I am so proud of the mother of my children for sharing this story, which caused our family so much pain. These acts of terror are not owned by one political party. I wish all Americans would acknowledge that fact and condemn all violence. Thank you, Vanessa.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Daniel Frisiello, the man accused of sending the powder-filled letters to Trump Jr. and other prominent Democrats, pleaded guilty. He will be sentenced in January and has agreed not to appeal his sentence if it is 7 1/4 years or less. One of the messages sent to Trump Jr. read, \"You are an awful, awful person. I am surprised that your father lets you speak on TV. You, the family idiot, Eric, looks smart.\" The message continued, \"This is the reason why people hate you, so you are getting what you deserve.\"",
    " Title: BJP Tweet Sparks Controversy Over National Register of Citizens\n\nArticle:\n\nIndia's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has faced criticism for a tweet that some perceive as mocking a phrase used by anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters. The slogan \"Kaaghaz Nahi Dikhayenge Hum\" (we will not show the documents) has been a common refrain during the more than seven weeks of protests against the CAA.\n\nThe BJP tweet, posted on February 8, reads: \"Keep the documents safe, you will need to show them again during # NPR exercise.\" The tweet has garnered over 31,000 likes and has been retweeted more than 10,000 times. Critics argue that the tweet threatens protesters and is a response to the planned National Register of Citizens (NRC).\n\nThe government has yet to decide on the implementation of the NRC, but it wants to proceed with the National Population Register (NPR), which critics say is a precursor to the NRC. The tweet has sparked controversy, with some accusing the right-wing party of undermining dissent and threatening protesters.\n\nSenior journalist Suhasini Haider tweeted, \"This taunting and mocking tone towards a minority by the ruling party is not just frightening; it is against everything India stands for.\" Gazala Wahab, assistant professor at JNU's Centre for the Study of Law and Governance, said, \"There is reason to believe that the party's bigoted dog-whistling is the true intent, and the union government's denials are not taken seriously even by the party in power itself.\"\n\nThe BJP's Karnataka handle has previously come under fire for controversial tweets. Last month, it posted a tweet comparing a student from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) with a gunman who fired at protesters near Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) university in New Delhi.\n\nEven some BJP supporters have taken exception to the tone of the tweet. Amrita Bhinder, a vocal supporter of the BJP and a former member of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha [the BJP youth wing], wrote, \"Not done! Adds to the fear factor! Derails PM Modi's pitch. Please be sensible.\"\n\nDelhi-based activist Shabnam Hashmi told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the Karnataka BJP is \"menacingly offensive\" and is constantly creating an atmosphere of \"hate and polarisation.\" She said, \"It seems to say whether you [Muslims] like it or not, you will have to show the documents during NPR. Not only Muslims but all marginalised sections will suffer heavily during the NRC process, the first step of which begins with NPR.\"\n\nBJP leaders from Karnataka have been accused of whipping up a xenophobic frenzy, with the state government cracking down on undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh. Last month, hundreds of people were rendered homeless after authorities demolished a slum in the state capital of Bengaluru, also known as the Silicon Valley of India, over rumours it was inhabited by Bangladeshis. It later turned out that all residents were Indian citizens.\n\nTejasvi Surya, a BJP member of parliament from Karnataka, has been accused of fear-mongering and Islamophobia. \"Shaheen Bagh is [a] symbol of Islamic fanaticism in garb of constitutional secularism,\" he tweeted, referring to the epicentre of anti-CAA protests.\n\nCritics say the citizenship law, which fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslims from three neighbouring countries, goes against the country's secular constitution. The law, along with the proposed nationwide NRC, has instilled fear among the country's Muslims, who form nearly 15 percent of India's 1.3 billion population.\n\nIndia has witnessed massive protests after the BJP-led government passed the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act in December last year. Nearly 30 people have died in the anti-CAA protests across the country so far. A similar exercise conducted in the northeastern state of Assam excluded nearly two million people from the citizenship list last year.\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said no individual will be required to submit any document for the NPR survey, but the tweet by Karnataka BJP says otherwise. BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli also said the NPR does not require citizenship documents. \"The tweet by the Karnataka BJP handle\u2026 leads to an unnecessary confusion because the NPR does not require any documents and it has been reiterated by the union government on a number of occasions,\" he said.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Introduce Bill to Enhance Long-Term Budget Transparency: The INFORM Act\n\nArticle:\n\nSenators John Thune (R-SD) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) have introduced a bill in Congress, known as the Intergenerational Financial Obligations Reform Act (INFORM), to increase transparency in the budget process and require long-term fiscal planning. The bill aims to provide a clearer picture of the impact of current and future budget decisions on future generations.\n\nThe senators expressed concern about the short-term focus of Washington's fiscal thinking, which they believe has led to a lack of information about long-term budget realities. They argue that this lack of information could place significant financial burdens on future generations.\n\nThe INFORM Act would require the president to provide a detailed accounting of the administration's budget and policy recommendations, as well as predictions of economic health, in terms of their impact on future generations. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) would be tasked with providing an annual analysis of the impact of future budget realities on generations to come and accounting for any fiscal gaps.\n\nThe bill's approach, known as generational accounting and fiscal gap analysis, would examine the full scope of the government's obligations, both present and future, and assess the impact those obligations will have on current and future generations. Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush each used this tool in submitting executive budgets.\n\nThe senators emphasized the importance of young Americans understanding the implications of current lawmakers' decisions for their future. They believe that the INFORM Act will help improve the fiscal health of the country by enabling better decision-making.\n\nThe senators' statement underscores a call for more long-term planning in Washington, as opposed to the current practice of short-term budgeting that ignores long-term consequences. The INFORM Act is intended to address this issue by providing a clearer picture of the long-term impact of budget decisions on future generations.",
    " Title: Permanent Work-from-Home Policies Likely as a Result of COVID-19 Pandemic, Experts Say\n\nArticle:\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has led to a significant shift in the U.S. workforce, with millions of employees transitioning from office life to working from home. As the pandemic continues, companies and their employees are preparing for several more months of remote work, with some questioning whether some workers will ever return to the office.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, less than 4% of the U.S. workforce worked remotely. In a matter of weeks, this number grew to include approximately a third of all workers in the country. Large companies, particularly those in the tech sector, have extended their work-from-home periods until the end of the year, with Twitter becoming the first major firm to allow employees to work permanently from home if they choose.\n\nIndustry experts predict that a significant portion of workers will not return to the office, citing benefits for both employees and companies. Employees save time and money on commuting and have more opportunities to spend time with their families, while companies could see financial benefits from cutting spending on expensive real estate and reducing the cost of maintaining office space.\n\nCompanies that were hesitant to allow remote work have found that concerns about lost productivity and harm to company culture are unfounded, according to labor analysts. The pandemic has also forced companies to tackle the expense and logistical challenges that may have been barriers to broad work-from-home policies.\n\nHowever, some are skeptical that the pandemic will lead to permanent changes. While working from home may be beneficial for some employees, it has been a strain for others, potentially leading to increased depression and loneliness. Certain industries that rely on creativity and problem-solving may fear that work will suffer without in-person collaboration. Other firms might be reluctant to surrender the control that comes from having all employees in the same place.\n\nOne thing is certain: many employees have proven they can effectively work from home, and companies are expected to continue letting many do so for a long time. The economic impact of the pandemic will likely force many employers to cut costs, and allowing workers to work from home is an easy solution, one that's less painful than layoffs. Executives and managers have the opportunity to choose quality work over quantity, valuing creative ideas that emerge during a midday hike or meditation session, rather than putting in face time at the office. They can stop rewarding the faster response over the better response, or the longer workday over a more productive workday.\n\nAs we sink into a recession, the job market will be tight for everyone. That means that while employers could offer benefits like working from home, they might not feel the need to. Sure, an employee might feel safer and happier if they don't expose themselves to germs on the subway and in the office. But with fewer job openings, a company can probably find someone else who doesn't mind coming in.",
    " Title: Trump to Meet with North Korean Leader: Potential Historic Summit or Diplomatic Risk?\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has accepted an invitation to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, marking a potential historic summit that could lead to the removal of North Korea's nuclear weapons. The meeting is set to take place before May, pending various conditions and negotiations.\n\nThe invitation and Trump's acceptance come amidst a series of diplomatic overtures from North Korea, a move that, if successful, could be compared to President Nixon's visit to China and the collapse of the Soviet Union in terms of historical significance.\n\nHowever, the path to this potential meeting is fraught with uncertainty, and much remains to be determined before the two leaders sit down for talks. The location, terms, and conditions of the meeting are still under negotiation, with speculation that it may take place along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating North and South Korea.\n\nTo ensure the sincerity of North Korea's peace offering and to avoid being manipulated in negotiations, President Trump must carefully navigate the diplomatic process. Here are some recommendations for the Trump administration:\n\n1. Insist on the meeting taking place in South Korea, ideally at the DMZ, to avoid legitimizing North Korea and to maintain a strong U.S. presence in the region.\n2. Maintain planned U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises, as North Korea has trained its army all winter long.\n3. Refrain from offering economic incentives to North Korea, such as food aid or a relaxation of economic sanctions, to prevent the appearance of bribery.\n4. Require North Korea to provide a preliminary roadmap for denuclearization, to prevent stalling tactics and the continued development of nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\nIf North Korea fails to offer even a preliminary roadmap for denuclearization, President Trump should decline the invitation, as it may indicate that Kim Jong Un is merely seeking sanctions relief and not genuinely interested in denuclearization.\n\nIn conclusion, while the potential for a historic summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un is exciting, the road to such a meeting is uncertain and fraught with potential pitfalls. The Trump administration must approach the negotiations with caution, ensuring that North Korea's intentions are sincere and that the U.S. does not inadvertently legitimize or reward North Korea's human rights abuses.",
    " Title: Gabrielle Giffords' Super PAC Takes Tougher Stance on Gun Control Advocacy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2011 Tucson shooting that left then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords critically injured, the United States has witnessed numerous mass shootings, including the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. These events led to a renewed push for gun control legislation, with President Obama and many members of Congress advocating for stricter background checks for gun buyers.\n\nDespite widespread public support for such measures, a Republican Senate filibuster thwarted the effort in 2012. In response, Gabrielle Giffords, who retired from Congress and became an ardent advocate for stricter background checks, has taken a more assertive approach in her advocacy.\n\nGiffords' super PAC, Americans for Responsible Solutions, is reportedly employing tougher tactics in the 2023 election cycle. One of the group's ads targets Republican Martha McSally, a retired Air Force pilot running for the Arizona seat previously held by Giffords. The ad features a heart-wrenching testimonial from a woman named Vicki, who recounts the murder of her 19-year-old daughter by an enraged ex-boyfriend. The ad alleges that McSally opposes making it harder for stalkers to obtain a gun.\n\nThe ad has been described as \"tough\" and \"emotional\" by political analysts. The editorial board of the Arizona Republic has criticized the ad, stating that it exploits a family's tragedy for political gain.\n\nGabrielle Giffords and her team are reportedly deeply involved in the making of the ads. The former congresswoman, known for her decency and good judgment during her time in office, is under no obligation to adhere to superficial \"civility\" standards. She has tried to unite Democrats and Republicans behind new gun legislation in the past, but those efforts did not yield significant results.\n\nNow, Giffords is taking a more confrontational approach, tying politicians who resist expanded background checks to the outcomes of mass shootings. The ad featuring Vicki is one example of this strategy. The ad's purpose is to highlight the connection between lax gun policies and instances of gun violence.\n\nGabrielle Giffords' advocacy for stricter gun laws continues, even as some criticize her tactics as being too aggressive or exploitative. The former congresswoman was a victim of gun violence herself and is determined to prevent others from suffering a similar fate.",
    " Title: Debt Limit Negotiations: Controversial Actions of Conservative Groups Overshadow Final Details of Deal\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the debt limit negotiations approach a resolution, two perspectives on the standoff have emerged. One interpretation suggests the entire conflict, now in its final stages, is a mere display of political posturing with little substance. The other, held by some movement conservatives, portrays the drama as a modern-day reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nThe Associated Press article, titled \"Debt limit defeat turns conservatives into neo-Confederate fantasists,\" presents a stark contrast between the reality of the situation and the sensational narratives being propagated by conservative news outlets. The article highlights several instances of controversial behavior by conservative protesters, including the display of Confederate flags and calls for violence against the President and his administration.\n\nThe article notes that these actions are being met with skepticism and concern, as they are not representative of the broader public opinion. The author suggests that these actions are the result of desperation and delusion among conservative dead-enders, as the deadline for a resolution approaches and the parties are haggling over minor details.\n\nThe article also discusses the ongoing negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who are quibbling over the specifics of the debt limit increase and government funding bill. The final points of contention include the size of the debt limit increase, the duration of government funding, and the funding level.\n\nThe article concludes by mentioning the actions of Senator Lindsey Graham, who has threatened to use the Senate's procedural rules to push a deal past the October 17 deadline, unless he is guaranteed a vote on a measure to strip members and aides of their employer-provided health care compensation. The potential consequences of such a move are discussed, as well as the possibility of other senators using it as a precedent to make larger demands, potentially leading to an accidental breach of the debt limit deadline.",
    " Title: Dispute Over Health Care Subsidies: A Legal and Political Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, President Obama's most significant legislative achievement, is facing a dispute over premium tax credits for health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that 23 million uninsured people will gain coverage through exchanges, with 22 million of them qualifying for subsidies, averaging over $6,000 per person annually. These subsidies, in the form of tax credits, will be available to individuals with incomes from the poverty level up to four times that amount.\n\nThe law states that subsidies will be provided to residents of a state to help defray the cost of health plans offered \"through an exchange established by the state.\" A rule issued by the Obama administration allows tax credits for insurance bought in either a state or a federal exchange.\n\nThe dispute revolves around the interpretation of the statutory language. Some argue that the law's language is explicit, stating that subsidies are for state-run exchanges, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is attempting to provide subsidies for all insurance exchanges, which will likely be challenged.\n\nRepresentative Phil Roe, a Republican from Tennessee, and another Tennessee Republican, Scott DesJarlais, have introduced a bill to nullify the IRS rule. Douglas H. Shulman, the I.R.S. commissioner, defended the rule as consistent with the intent of Congress.\n\nThe political brawling over health care will continue this week on Capitol Hill, with the House planning to vote on a Republican measure to repeal the health care law. Democrats, who control the Senate, say repeal efforts have no chance of success there.\n\nThe dispute over subsidies involves a serious legal issue, according to James F. Blumstein, a professor of constitutional and health law at Vanderbilt University. He stated that the IRS's interpretation will likely be challenged by someone, possibly an employer penalized because one or more of its employees receive subsidies through a federal exchange.\n\nMichael F. Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, noted the link between subsidies and penalties as a crucial part of the law. He explained that if workers cannot receive subsidies in states with a federal exchange, their employers cannot be penalized, which would hobble federal efforts to get employers to offer coverage in those states.\n\nProf. Timothy S. Jost, an expert on health law at Washington and Lee University, described the issue as a drafting error that should be obvious to anyone who understands the new health care law. He supports the law but believes Congress made an error in not including premium tax credits for the citizens of states that end up with a federal exchange.",
    " Title: DHS Secretary Nielsen's Resignation and the Future of U.S. Immigration Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe resignation of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has sparked debate over the future of U.S. immigration policy and the potential appointment of a successor who may be more aligned with President Donald Trump's hardline stance.\n\nNielsen, who oversaw several controversial immigration policies during her tenure, was reportedly criticized by the president for perceived weakness on border security issues. Despite this, she resisted some of Trump's more contentious demands, such as the reinstatement of family separations and the blocking of asylum seekers.\n\nNielsen's most notable actions include the implementation of the family separation policy at the southern border, the design of a plan to limit asylum-seekers, and the enforcement of a policy deemed unlawful that prevented immigrants from applying for asylum if they entered the country illegally.\n\nActing DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who is expected to take over from Nielsen, has expressed a more compassionate approach to immigration, advocating for a fast and responsible screening process and referring to migrants as \"vulnerable families\" in need of humanitarian treatment.\n\nThe effectiveness of U.S. aid to Central America, a point of contention between McAleenan and the president, is another area of potential contrast between the acting secretary and the administration's hardline immigration policies.\n\nThe delicate balance between securing the U.S. border and protecting vulnerable asylum seekers is a long-standing issue in U.S. immigration law. Both domestic and international law prohibit the U.S. from refusing entry to people in danger of persecution in their home countries, and offer additional due-process protections to asylum seekers, children, and families.\n\nThe resignation of Nielsen and other DHS officials has raised concerns about the direction of the agency under the Trump administration. Some argue that the new era of DHS will prioritize the president's nativist goals, regardless of the law.\n\nThe future role of McAleenan in shaping U.S. immigration policy remains uncertain, as does the extent to which he will align with Trump's hardline stance on immigration. The president's anger towards Nielsen is seen by some as a reflection of his dissatisfaction with the delicate balance in U.S. immigration law.\n\nIn the absence of an explicit quid pro quo agreement, the context and circumstances surrounding the administration's immigration policies will likely become the focus of ongoing investigation and debate. The extent to which this evidence will lead to impeachment or significant policy changes remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Iranian Officials Reject Trump's Offer for Unconditional Meeting with No Value, Cite Past Negotiations and Economic Pressures\n\nArticle:\n\nIranian officials have expressed opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump's offer for a meeting with no preconditions, stating that such talks would have \"no value\" and be a \"humiliation.\" The U.S. and Iran have not held leader-to- leader meetings since before the 1979 Iranian revolution.\n\nIn May, the U.S. abandoned a deal that curbed Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions. The U.S. is deeply suspicious of Iranian activity in the Middle East and is an ally of Israel and Saudi Arabia, two of Iran's foes.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump said he was open to meeting the Iranian side, stating, \"I'd meet with anybody. I believe in meetings... if they want to meet, we'll meet.\" However, Iranian officials have made it clear that only \"returning to the nuclear deal\" and \"respecting the Iranian nation's rights\" would pave the way for talks.\n\nIran's deputy speaker, Ali Motahari, told state news agency Irna that the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal meant that \"negotiation with the Americans would be a humiliation now.\" Kamal Kharazi, the head of Iran's Strategic Council of Foreign Relations, said there was \"no value in Trump's proposal\" given Iran's \"bad experiences in negotiations with America\" and \"US officials' violations of their commitments.\"\n\nThe Trump administration regards Iran as a destabilizing force in the Middle East, arguing that the nuclear deal enabled Iran to pursue a more assertive regional policy. Iran has sent hundreds of troops and thousands of volunteer militiamen to Syria, and has strengthened its military presence there. Gulf states have accused Iran of backing Yemen's Houthi rebels with both money and weapons, though Iran has denied this. Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally, is a major adversary of Iran and has repeatedly warned about Iran's intentions.\n\nIn May, Mr. Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a \"horrible, one-sided deal.\" He alleged that the deal did not restrict Iran's \"destabilizing activities\" in the region enough. Analysts also cited the influence of White House hawks including U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, and Mr. Trump's tendency to target major policies of his predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\nIran insists its nuclear program is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has said Iran is honoring its commitments. Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, with exports worth billions of dollars each year. It is already feeling economic pressures, and has seen large-scale protests over rising prices and a decline in the value of its currency, the rial.",
    " Title: Congresswomen Urge Inclusion of Student Debt Cancellation in Next COVID-19 Relief Package\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of House representatives, led by Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Alma Adams, have sent a public letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, urging them to include student debt cancellation and loan relief in the next COVID-19 relief package. The letter, signed by an additional 28 members of Congress, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Joe Kennedy III, argues that more relief is necessary to address the economic crisis caused by the pandemic.\n\nThe CARES Act, the first relief package, postponed payments for some federal student loan borrowers until September 2020. However, the congresswomen argue that this short-term relief does not reflect the long-term economic impact of the pandemic, which public health experts and economists estimate could last up to 18 months.\n\nThe letter proposes three solutions to the student loan crisis. The most aggressive solution is a one-time cancellation of at least $30,000 for all federal student loan borrowers. This, they argue, would disproportionately benefit vulnerable borrowers, potentially eliminating the loan balance of millions of low-income people and borrowers of color.\n\nThe CARES Act postponed payments for some federal student loan borrowers, but it excludes one in five borrowers, namely those with commercially held FFEL loans or Perkins Loans. The letter urges Congress to provide long-term payment relief for all federal student loan borrowers and to expand protections to those with private loans through cancellation, a suspension of payments and involuntary collections, as well as the opportunity to refinance any outstanding balance at lower interest rates.\n\nThroughout the letter, the congresswomen highlight the disproportionate impact of the student loan burden on communities of color, particularly Black and Latinx communities. They note that these communities are not only experiencing the worst of the coronavirus pandemic but also face an unequal burden when it comes to student loans.\n\nThe bill for the next COVID-19 relief package is expected next week. The letter does not specify the exact amount of debt cancellation or the duration of the loan relief proposed in the bill.",
    " Title: ISIS Blows Up 80-Year-Old Church in Tal Nasri, Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nAssyrian Christians in Syria were celebrating Easter Sunday when militants from the Islamic State (ISIS) detonated an 80-year-old church in the Tal Nasri village, located in the western countryside of Hasaka province in northeastern Syria. The church, known as the Church of the Virgin Mary, was originally built in 1934 and is one of three main churches in the Assyrian village.\n\nSince February, Tal Nasri has been under the control of the jihadist group led by self-proclaimed Caliph al-Baghdadi. Fighters from Kurdish militias and Christians who have taken up arms have been attempting to regain control of the village. According to reports, ISIS jihadists booby-trapped the church with explosives before detonating it.\n\nThe Assyrian International News Agency (AINA) reported that the church has been \"leveled.\" Christians make up just 10% of Syria's mostly Muslim Sunni population, and this year's Assyrian Easter celebrations have been limited to prayers and masses due to the ongoing conflict in the country.\n\nThe bombing is the latest in a series of acts of destruction by ISIS, who have targeted places of worship in the areas they control. ISIS has already destroyed numerous religious sites and shrines, and have raged against any religious or artistic expression that does not conform to their worldview. They have razed temples, Sufi mosques, and churches, as well as destroying statues and archaeological finds with pickaxes.\n\nIn recent days, ISIS released a propaganda video showing a group of men engaged in destroying statues and parts of the facade of an old building in Hatra, a city of the ancient Parthian Empire. Another image released by ISIS shows the destruction of the monastery of Mar Behnam in Iraq.\n\nIn February, Islamist militants burned down the historic church of Tal Hurmoz, one of the oldest churches in Syria, and destroyed three other churches in the town of Tal Tamer in Hasaka province. All six UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Syria have been damaged.",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Denies Preparing for 2020 Presidential Run, Calls New York Times Report \"Fake News\"\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence has denied that he is preparing for a presidential election run in 2020, stating that the suggestion is \"disgraceful and offensive.\" The denial comes in response to a report by The New York Times that some Republicans were forming a \"shadow campaign\" as though President Donald Trump were not involved.\n\nThe report, published on Sunday, stated that multiple advisers to Pence had intimated to party donors that he would plan to run if Trump did not. The article also mentioned that Pence had kept a full political calendar and had created his own independent power base, including a political fund-raising group called the \"Great America Committee.\"\n\nHowever, Pence called the article \"fake news\" and stated that his entire team was focused on advancing Trump's agenda and seeing him re-elected in 2020. In a statement, Pence said, \"The allegations in this article are categorically false and represent just the latest attempt by the media to divide this Administration.\"\n\nThe Times stood by its coverage, with spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha stating in an email, \"We are confident in the accuracy of our reporting and will let the story speak for itself.\"\n\nPence has good relations with conservative political groups and some of the Republican Party's big donors, including billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. He is also a Trump loyalist, and there is typically little distinction between his public statements and the policies of the president.\n\nHowever, as investigations deepen into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible ties to members of Trump's campaign, Pence has put some distance between himself and the president on the best way to approach Moscow. On a trip to Eastern Europe last week, Pence condemned Russia's presence in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, with which Moscow fought a brief war in 2008. He also said ties with Russia would not improve until Moscow changed its stance on Ukraine and withdrew support for countries like Iran, Syria, and North Korea.\n\nThe U.S. Congress recently passed a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia with overwhelming bipartisan support, but Trump signed it into law last week with reluctance. \"Our relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous low,\" Trump wrote on Twitter after signing the bill. \"You can thank Congress.\"\n\nTrump has described probes into his campaign's ties to Russia, including those underway in Congress and a Justice Department investigation headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as a \"witch hunt.\" The president has also sent mixed messages on whether he agrees with U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusions that Russia tried to intervene in the 2016 election to boost his chances of beating Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhite House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway also dismissed the idea that Pence was looking at running for president in 2020. \"It is absolutely true that the vice president is getting ready for 2020 - for re-election as vice president,\" Conway told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday. \"Vice President Pence is a very loyal, very dutiful, but also incredibly effective vice president, and active vice president,\" said Conway, adding that she had worked for Pence for a decade as his pollster and senior adviser.",
    " Title: Americans Favorably View Many Federal Agencies, Including CDC and HHS\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by \u2588\u2588\u2588 has found that Americans hold broadly favorable views of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which are at the forefront of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Other agencies, such as the Postal Service, the Census Bureau, and the Department of Homeland Security, also receive favorable ratings from the public.\n\nThe survey, conducted in March 2020 among 1,013 U.S. adults, found that 79% of respondents express a favorable opinion of the CDC, with large majorities of Republicans (84%) and Democrats (77%) holding positive views. Views of the CDC among Republicans have grown more positive in recent years, while Democrats' views have shown less change.\n\nThe survey also found that 80% of respondents view HHS favorably, up 17 percentage points since last fall. In 2013 and 2015, fewer than half of Republicans viewed this agency favorably. Majorities of Democrats have consistently expressed positive views of HHS (70% currently).\n\nThe survey found that more than three years into the Trump administration, larger shares of Republicans than Democrats express favorable opinions of eight of the ten government agencies included in the survey. For the other two agencies, the Postal Service and the IRS, nearly identical majorities in both parties have favorable opinions.\n\nRepublicans' views of the Justice Department improved after Donald Trump's election, while Democrats turned more negative. Even so, favorable views of the DOJ have increased sharply since September; currently, 76% of Republicans view the DOJ favorably, up from 61% last fall and the highest positive rating for the department in polling going back a decade. By comparison, 50% of Democrats feel favorably toward the Justice Department, little changed from the fall and among the lowest ratings in a decade.\n\nViews of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) remain polarized, with 77% of Republicans and Republican leaners viewing the agency favorably, compared with only 28% of Democrats and Democratic leaners.\n\nWith the decennial census underway, 77% of Americans overall view the Census Bureau favorably, compared with just 12% who hold an unfavorable view. The public holds positive views of several federal agencies, but ratings of the Postal Service continue to stand out, with an overwhelming 91% saying they have a favorable view of the mail delivery service.\n\nNine of the ten agencies included in the survey are viewed more favorably than unfavorably by the public. ICE is the only agency for which about equal shares express an unfavorable (45%) as favorable (46%) view. Among the agencies viewed in a positive light, the majorities viewing each favorably range from 91% for the Postal Service to 60% for the Justice Department.\n\nAbout two-thirds view Veterans Affairs and the IRS favorably (both 65%), and slightly more hold favorable views of the Federal Reserve (69%) and the Department of Homeland Security (71%). For many federal agencies, there are only modest differences in ratings between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nThe widest partisan divide in the survey is in assessments of ICE, with Republicans and Republican leaners being 49 points more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to hold a favorable view of the agency (77% vs. 28%). The share of Republicans with a favorable view of ICE has increased 7 points since September 2019. Among Democrats, ratings of ICE remain overwhelmingly negative (64% view the agency unfavorably), though the share with a favorable view has increased since last fall (up 9 points). The overall gap in ratings of ICE between Republicans and Democrats remains about the same as it has been over the last few years.\n\nAs the Census Bureau launches its decennial census, majorities of both Republicans and Democrats hold positive views of the agency. Republicans' views of the Census Bureau have grown considerably more positive over the last two years, with 83% of Republicans viewing the Census Bureau favorably, compared with 66% who held a favorable view of the agency in 2018. Among Democrats, views of the Census Bureau have remained relatively stable, with about three-quarters of Democrats (76%) saying they hold favorable views of the agency today, views were similar in 2019 and 2018.",

The incident occurred at approximately 2:35 am, with Amtrak Train 91, en route to Miami from New York, colliding with the CSX train.\n\nAccording to reports, the Amtrak train derailed, carrying eight crewmembers and 139 passengers. The injured individuals were transported to local hospitals, with injuries ranging from minor scratches to broken bones. Approximately 5,000 gallons of fuel were spilled, but authorities stated there is \"no threat to the public at this time.\"\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has been called to investigate the incident. This marks the second fatal crash involving an Amtrak train in recent weeks.\n\nSouth Carolina Governor Henry McMaster stated that the Amtrak train was on the wrong track, while the CSX freight train, which had no passengers aboard, was on its designated track. Amtrak stated that CSX owns and maintains the area where the collision occurred, with CSX controlling the dispatching of all trains and directing the signal systems.\n\nRobert Sumwalt, chair of the NTSB, stated that one priority in the investigation is to recover data recorders to determine the speed of the Amtrak train at the point of collision.\n\nDerek Pettaway, a passenger on one of the train's rear cars, told CNN that he was awakened by the impact and helped off the train \"really quickly\" by the crew. He went to the hospital and was discharged with minor whiplash before going to a shelter for passengers at Pine Ridge Middle School.\n\nLocal reporter Chad Mills reported that he was told by a source the casualty number isn't expected to rise and \"we dodged a bullet on this one.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump was briefed on the incident and is receiving regular updates, according to White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters. The president also addressed the incident on Twitter.\n\nThe exact cause of the crash, or how fast either train was going at the time of the collision, remains unknown.",
    " Title: U.S. Lifts Arms Embargo Against Vietnam, Boosting Defense Capabilities and Normalizing Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama on Monday fully lifted the United States' 41-year arms embargo against Vietnam, marking a significant step in the normalization of relations between the two countries. At a news conference in Hanoi, Obama stated, \"This change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself and removes a lingering vestige of the Cold War.\"\n\nThe move comes as a means of bolstering Vietnam's defenses against China, although President Obama denied this intention. He emphasized that the decision to lift the embargo was not based on China or any other considerations, but rather on the completion of the lengthy process of moving towards normalization with Vietnam.\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. partially lifted the embargo, but Vietnam sought full access as it navigates China's land reclamation and military construction in the disputed South China Sea. Vietnam has not made any purchases, but the removal of the remaining restrictions indicates that relations are fully normalized and opens the way to deeper security cooperation.\n\nIn response, China's Foreign Ministry praised the move, with a spokeswoman stating that normal and friendly relations between the U.S. and Vietnam would be conducive to regional stability. China itself remains under a weapons embargo imposed by the U.S. and European Union following the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square.\n\nObama also addressed the South China Sea issue, stating that the U.S. and Vietnam share mutual concerns about maritime issues and the importance of maintaining freedom of navigation in the region. He clarified that although the U.S. does not take sides on the territorial disputes, it does support a diplomatic resolution based on \"international norms\" and not based on \"who's the bigger party and can throw around their weight a little bit more,\" a reference to China.\n\nWhile the announcement is a significant step in normalizing relations with Vietnam, Obama added that the country will not immediately receive a flood of weapons. Each U.S. arms sale will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, he said, and will still need to meet strict requirements, including those related to human rights. Activists and members of Congress had hoped the president would wait to fully lift the embargo until Vietnam improved its human rights record.",

This election has seen a record number of women, Native Americans, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants, millennials, and LGBT candidates running for office. As results continue to roll in, here are some of the key trailblazing candidates who have already won their races:\n\n1. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (New York): At 29 years old, Ocasio-Cortez has become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. She unseated a 10-term incumbent in the June primary and will represent New York's 14th district.\n\n2. Ayanna Pressley (Massachusetts): Pressley, the first black woman to serve on Boston's city council, made history again after defeating the 10-term incumbent Michael Capuano in the primary. She did not face a challenger in the general election and will represent Massachusetts' 7th district.\n\n3. Rashida Tlaib (Michigan): Tlaib, a democratic socialist, has become the nation's first Palestinian-American woman in Congress and one of two Muslim women elected on Tuesday. She ran on a platform supporting Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, and abolishing ICE.\n\n4. Ilhan Omar (Minnesota): Omar, also the first Somali-American in Congress, is a former refugee who spent the last four years as a state legislator. She ran on a progressive platform, including a $15 minimum wage and subsidizing higher education costs for low-income students.\n\n5. Jared Polis (Colorado): Polis, who declared victory late on Tuesday night, has become the first openly gay governor in the U.S. He ran on a left-wing platform, which included single-payer healthcare, repeal of the death penalty, universal full-day preschool, and stronger gun laws.\n\n6.

The incident occurred Monday evening, hours after Battel's inadvertent insults went viral.\n\nAccording to an exclusive report by The Daily Caller, Battel, whose LinkedIn and Facebook pages appeared to have been disabled, phoned Mr. James' campaign Monday afternoon seeking an interview for Wednesday to discuss Election Day's results. Thinking she had hung up the phone, Battel expressed her dismay at the prospect of Mr. James, an African-American Army veteran, potentially defeating incumbent Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow.\n\n\"Man, if he beats her \u2026 Jesus!\", she exclaimed, The Daily Caller reported. After referring to Mr. James with an expletive, Battel added, \"Whew, that would suck! But I don't think that's going to happen though.\"\n\nThe voice message, with Battel's contact information expunged, quickly spread online and, within hours, she was out of a job.\n\n\"I have listened to the voicemail left by Brenda Battel to Mr. James' campaign, and find no reason to defend this behavior,\" said Kate Hessling, editor of The Huron Daily Tribune, in a statement. \"Brenda Battel's employment has been immediately terminated.\"\n\n\"The Huron Daily Tribune sincerely apologizes to Mr. James and to the public,\" Ms. Hessling's statement continued. \"These statements do not represent the views of the Tribune as a whole, nor do they reflect the actions of a responsible journalist.\"\n\nAs of Monday night, The Huron Daily Tribune's website did not list Battel among the two reporters on staff.

    " Title: Tentative Deal Reached Between Trump and Kim Jong Un: A Look at the Proposed Agreement and Its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nA tentative deal between United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, set to be finalized during their summit in Vietnam, has emerged. The agreement, as currently outlined, appears to be a significant victory for Kim Jong Un.\n\nUnder the proposed agreement, the U.S. would agree to lift some sanctions on North Korea and improve relations, in exchange for a commitment from Kim Jong Un to close down a key nuclear facility. The details of the agreement, as described by three individuals familiar with the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues, are as follows:\n\n1. Both countries will sign a peace declaration, symbolically ending the Korean War. The conflict, which ended in an armistice in 1953, is technically still ongoing. The agreement would effectively, although not officially, end hostilities between the two countries and significantly improve their relations.\n2. North Korea will agree to return more remains of U.S. troops who died during the Korean War, although the number and timing are unclear. Last year, following the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore, North Korea returned the remains of 55 American service members.\n3. The U.S. and North Korea will establish liaison offices, which are quasi-embassies with minimal authorities, in each other's nations. This will be the first concrete step toward normalizing diplomatic ties between the two longtime enemies.\n4. North Korea will agree to stop producing materials for nuclear bombs at its Yongbyon facility. In exchange, the U.S. will push to lift some UN sanctions on Pyongyang so it can pursue joint economic projects with South Korea. It's also possible the deal will include other nuclear facilities, one source said.\n\nIt's important to note that the deal may still change before the summit on February 27 in Vietnam. However, the deal as it currently stands aligns with many expectations heading into the summit.\n\nThe most controversial aspect of the proposed deal is the promise from Kim to shutter the Yongbyon facility in exchange for some modest sanctions relief. The Yongbyon nuclear facility is considered the \"heart\" of North Korea's nuclear program, as it's the only known place where the country can make plutonium for nuclear bombs. If it shuts down, Pyongyang's ability to make plutonium-fueled nuclear weapons will be severely curtailed, although it would not mean the end of its nuclear program.\n\nHowever, the deal's success hinges on Kim's commitment to allow international inspectors into the facility to verify that nuclear material production has ended. Without these inspections, there's no way to know if Kim has followed through on his promise. This is a move the leader may be reluctant to take, and even if he does so, he could always restart the shuttered facility once the inspectors leave, as his father, Kim Jong Il, did twice before, after deals with the U.S. collapsed.\n\nExperts want any deal on closing Yongbyon to be extremely detailed, with clear and concise language to allow technical experts to monitor and verify each step in the process. If Trump moves to lift sanctions before Kim actually ends all production at Yongbyon, he will have offered a significant concession without receiving anything substantive in return.\n\nBy signing a peace declaration, both sides will reduce tensions and improve relations. By returning more troop remains to the U.S., North Korea will demonstrate its commitment to staying in America's good graces. However, the deal does not significantly advance the fundamental goal of denuclearizing North Korea and primarily rewards Kim with much-needed sanctions relief for making vague promises. In this sense, the deal is not a significant win for Trump but is a considerable victory for Kim Jong Un.\n\nHowever, if this deal serves as a stepping stone to more comprehensive deals in the future, leading North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program, it could be viewed favorably in a few years.",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Reveals Funding Source of Migrant Caravan, Glenn Beck Discusses Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nDuring a media briefing on Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence revealed that Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez stated that the migrant caravan currently traveling towards the southern U.S. border was organized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela. This information was discussed further on Wednesday's episode of \"The Glenn Beck Radio Program.\"\n\nGlenn Beck questioned the media's lack of concern regarding the caravan, stating, \"Have you noticed that the press is not concerned at all about this caravan? They say the caravan's not going to make it up to the United States, that it's just nonsense and why are they talking about it. Really?\"\n\nBeck noted that the 7,000-person-strong migrant caravan appears to be both a political message and a weapon. He suggested that the caravan was organized in Honduras by a leftist political party to embarrass the current right-wing government. Beck also pointed out that moving such a large group of people over 2,500 miles is expensive, and questioned who is funding the food, water, medical care, transportation, and other necessities for the migrants.\n\nBeck asked, \"Who is writing the check for all of this?\" He suggested that Venezuelan President Maduro, who is struggling financially, could be using the caravan as a means to attack the United States by organizing and funding thousands of people to flood the border. Beck also raised concerns about potential criminal elements, Venezuelan or Cuban spies, and terrorists among the migrants.\n\nListeners can watch the full episode on TheBlaze TV, with a free trial available for new subscribers.

This development has sparked controversy and concerns over freedom of speech and the right to conscience.\n\nYesterday, a heated debate erupted on Twitter over the use of pronouns in a Corner post discussing Chelsea Manning's release from prison. The author, in this case, faced backlash for using male pronouns to describe Manning, who identifies as a woman. The author was labeled a transphobe and faced other derogatory comments for refusing to identify Manning as a woman.\n\nIn New York City, the government has enacted legislation that punishes employers, landlords, businesses, and professionals who refuse to use an individual's preferred name, pronoun, or title if they do not conform to gender stereotypes. The New York City Human Rights Commission defines a \"violation\" of its human-rights law as refusing to use an individual's preferred name, pronoun, or title because they do not conform to gender stereotypes.\n\nThe Obama administration also issued guidance, since repealed, that required every federally funded educational institution in the United States to treat students consistent with their gender identity, even if their education records or identification documents indicate a different sex. The guidance also mandated that school staff and contractors use pronouns and names consistent with a transgender student's gender identity.\n\nThis compelled speech has been criticized as a violation of the rights of conscience of the speaker and a government effort to coerce verbal agreement with a contested and contentious personal, religious, cultural, and scientific debate. The issue has been compared to the West Virginia v. Barnette case, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the government cannot prescribe what beliefs individuals should hold or force them to express those beliefs through speech or action.\n\nThe author of the Corner post argues that using male pronouns to describe Chelsea Manning is not an act of bigotry but a reflection of biological reality. The author cites the biblical account of creation, which states that God created man and woman in His image. The author also rejects the notion that using male pronouns for Manning is a matter of manners, stating that such a definition of manners requires individuals to verbally consent to a fundamentally false and important premise.\n\nThe author concludes by expressing concern that dissent from this issue is seen as a \"tell\" for underlying bigotry and that the debate is beyond reasonable disagreement. The author also criticizes prominent transgender activist Parker Molloy for labeling disagreement on the issue as bigotry and for equating the use of incorrect pronouns with blasphemy in the secular faith of the illiberal Left.\n\nThe author calls for open and respectful conversations about pronoun usage, gender identity, and the reasons why a transgender person believes that deeply felt identity trumps biology in defining male and female. However, the author states that these conversations are increasingly hard to find and that dissent from this issue is seen as a \"tell\" for underlying bigotry. The author warns against the dangers of intolerance moving from irritation into censorship and calls for the preservation of free speech and the right to conscience in the debate over transgender issues.",
    " Title: U.S. Stocks Retreat as Government Shutdown Looms; Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite Decline\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. stocks experienced a broad-based retreat on Friday as a potential government shutdown loomed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) dropped 0.33%, the S&P 500 (SP500) declined 0.07%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index (COMP) fell 0.05%.\n\nEarlier in the week, the U.S. House passed a spending package that included $5 billion for President Trump's campaign-promised border wall. However, in the Senate, where 60 votes are required for passage of the spending bill, the measure appeared dead on arrival.\n\nOn Friday, shares initially rose as a durable goods report and a revision to the third-quarter gross domestic product\u2014both weaker than expected\u2014indicated that the Federal Reserve might have less reason to raise interest rates.\n\nAs the session progressed and a government shutdown appeared increasingly inevitable, the market experienced a broad-based decline. Shares of big capitalization and big tech companies led the retreat. Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell below the $1,000 level for the first time since April 4. The shares entered a bear market on Thursday and are currently down almost 23% from its record close of $1,285.50 on July 26.\n\nShares of packaged foods company Conagra Brands tumbled to a 52-week low after the company missed sales expectations. Other notable declines include Facebook (-0.66%), Netflix (-3.05%), and Amazon (-1.40%).\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. shares tumbled, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling nearly 500 points or about 2% and sliding below 23,000 for the first time in 14 months. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also plummeted, now flirting with bear market territory. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 lost over 1% during the session. At the same time, volatility spiked to the highest level since February.\n\nThe selling accelerated after President Trump told House Republican leaders on Thursday he will not sign a Senate-passed spending package that does not include sought-after border security funds, upending negotiations to avert a government shutdown by the end of the week, as reported by Fox News.\n\nInternational markets also experienced declines. Japan's Nikkei finished the session lower by 1.1% and down 5.6% for the week. China's Shanghai Composite ended the day down 0.8% and off 3% for the week. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed out the day higher by 0.5%, but fell 1.3% for the week. In European trading, London's FTSE traded little changed, Germany's DAX added 0.2%, and France's CAC was little changed.",
    " Title: Gary Johnson's Presidential Campaign Gains Momentum Across the U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nGary Johnson, the Libertarian Party's presidential candidate, has been touring the country, recently moving from Miami to Las Vegas. In Las Vegas, Johnson addressed a \"high energy\" crowd, emphasizing his commitment to individual choice and limited government intervention.\n\nJohnson expressed his support for gay marriage, abortion rights, and the decriminalization of marijuana. He also criticized the death penalty as a flawed public policy. In Nevada, Johnson encouraged voters to support the November referendum that could legalize recreational marijuana for adults over 21.\n\nThe Libertarian ticket, including Johnson and his running mate, Bill Weld, are hopeful about meeting the Commission on Presidential Debates' 15 percent in five polls threshold, although they may not reach it for the first debate on September 26. Weld suggested that if they do not meet the polling benchmark for the initial debate, they could potentially qualify for a later debate, with the final debate scheduled for October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV).\n\nJoe Brezny, a spokesman for the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol and a former campaign manager for Mitt Romney's presidential bid, expressed his support for Johnson and Weld. Brezny stated, \"I watched some good people nominate the least electable person in mankind.\"\n\nWeld emphasized the fiscal conservatism he and Johnson demonstrated during their gubernatorial tenures as crucial for Washington D.C. Johnson pledged that, if elected, he would present Congress with a balanced budget within the first 100 days of his presidency.\n\nMontana political analysts believe Johnson could easily double his 3 percent from the 2012 election, as Montana voters have historically supported candidates outside of the two major political parties. In 2012, Libertarian candidate Dan Cox received 6.5 percent of the vote in Montana's Senate race, potentially influencing the outcome of the race between Republican Denny Rehberg and incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat.\n\nIf Johnson manages to secure $10 million in direct campaign donations, he may face the risk of receiving Secret Service protection. The campaign reported pulling $3 million from 92,000 distinct donors in just this month.\n\nIn Maine, Johnson will be appearing on August 26. He has gained support from voters like Heidi Sawyer, who appreciates his fiscal conservatism, small government approach, and opposition to wasteful spending. Sawyer, a socially liberal voter, finds appeal in Johnson's stance on issues like gay marriage and foreign policy.\n\nTo maintain ballot status as an official party in Maine, the Libertarian Party needs 10,000 registered voters who are enrolled in the party to cast ballots in the General Election, according to the state government. This requirement was discussed in a previous report on Maine's challenging but ultimately successful fight to secure a place on the ballot this year.",
    " Title: Republican Party's Handling of Donald Trump Could Lead to Third-Party Candidacy, Potential Nightmare Scenario\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican Party's public rebuke of billionaire businessman Donald Trump for his inflammatory comments may inadvertently lead to a third-party presidential candidacy by Trump, a potential nightmare scenario for the GOP establishment. This scenario would involve a populist outsider attacking the Republican nominee from the right in the general election, raising issues and attracting votes with his rhetoric on topics like illegal immigration.\n\nRalph Nader, a multiple-time third-party presidential candidate who is believed to have cost Democrat Al Gore the 2000 election by running to his left, warned that the Republican Party establishment is \"playing with nitroglycerine\" when they go after Trump and attempt to minimize him or exclude him from the party. A jilted Trump as a third-party candidate could \"blow the presidential race wide open and turn it into a three-way race,\" Nader said in an interview on Thursday.\n\nTrump has become a favorite target of criticism since launching his White House campaign last month, angering fellow Republicans with his comments about Sen. John McCain's status as a war hero last week. Trump has fired back at the criticism, especially a rebuke from the typically-neutral Republican National Committee. He has repeatedly declined to rule out a third-party White House run, saying in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper earlier this month that he is constantly being asked to run as an independent. This week, he told The Hill that his decision will depend on \"how I'm being treated by the Republicans.\"\n\nLaunching a third-party candidacy is a time-consuming and expensive process, riddled with logistical hurdles, including massive signature-gathering requirements to gain ballot access in each of the 50 states. However, a candidate with significant resources, such as Trump, could potentially overcome these challenges.\n\nRepublicans remember all too well businessman Ross Perot's independent candidacy for president in 1992. The Texan made an appeal to voters looking for an alternative to establishment candidates, and his campaign is widely considered to have complicated George H.W. Bush's effort to win reelection against Bill Clinton.\n\nClay Mulford, Perot's son-in-law and political adviser, said a third-party run from Trump has the potential to energize a part of the electorate that is itching for a fresh face. \"There is just a sense of ineffectiveness of the two-party system. So I think he would do better than expected if he were in the debates and if he were considered viable,\" Mulford said. \"And having money helps.\"\n\nIndeed, poll numbers suggest that a third-party candidacy from Trump would damage Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a top-tier candidate in the current Republican field. In a head-to-head match-up, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton leads Bush, 50% to 44%, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll out this week. However, throw an independent Trump into that race, and Clinton's lead grows significantly to 46%, leaving Bush at 30%.\n\nAt a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Thursday, Bush made sure to emphasize that he is not dismissive of Trump's candidacy. \"I think he's a serious candidate and he's going to have a lot of money. He's tapping into people's angst that are legitimate,\" Bush said. Meanwhile, during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Laredo, Texas, on Thursday, Trump said his preference is to run as a Republican and he was confident that he could win the party's nomination. However, in many ways, a third-party run makes a lot of sense for Trump. The former host of the reality TV show \"The Apprentice\" was once a registered Democrat, donated money to members of both parties, and considered running for president in 2000 as an independent. At the very core of his campaign is the idea that he is the anti-politician. Trump has never held public office and he loves to point out that, thanks to his massive wealth\u2014which he claims amounts to more than $10 billion\u2014he is not beholden to anyone, including party leadership. This last point has already created massive headaches for the GOP. Trump sparked furious backlash by referring to some Mexican immigrants that enter the United States as \"criminals\" and \"rapists.\" Republicans criticized Trump's choice of words as being hurtful and insensitive to the immigrant community, but many chose their words carefully\u2014a sign of how delicate of an issue illegal immigration is. For many Republicans, Trump seemed to cross the line last weekend with his critique of Sen. John McCain. \"I like people that were not captured, OK?\" Trump said of the Arizona Republican senator, who spent more than five years in as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. The RNC, which remains neutral in the GOP nominating process, took the unusual move of speaking out. \"There is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably,\" said RNC spokesman Sean Spicer. Bill Hillsman, a political consultant who has worked for a number of independent candidates including in gubernatorial races in Massachusetts and Texas, said the party's condemnation of Trump is likely to have helped fuel Trump's unorthodox campaign. \"I think the damage is already done to a large extent,\" Hillsman said. \"All the people who said well, his campaign is over now and blasted him for some of his previous comments, many of which he's walked back, they already have just pretty much dismissed this guy and the polls are saying otherwise.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Faces Potential Second Wave of COVID-19 Infections Coinciding with Flu Season\n\nArticle:\n\nEpidemiologists and public-health officials in the United States are bracing for a potential second wave of COVID-19 infections later this year, coinciding with the peak of the 2020-21 U.S. influenza season. The concern is that this second wave could lead to a new surge of hospital patients in need of respiratory support.\n\nThe fear is justified, as both COVID-19 and influenza infections typically begin rising in November and peak at some point in December, January, or February, before subsiding by April. The severity of each wave, however, remains uncertain.\n\nInfluenza infection patterns are better understood than those of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, but influenza remains a known unknown due to the annual variation in its strains. The severity of the 2020-21 influenza season will depend on how well the vaccine matches the strain of the virus and on the particular strain itself.\n\nCompared to influenza viruses, the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 is a much greater unknown. The seasonal appearance of SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of influenza, except that infections do not disappear in the summer months; instead, they continue at a reduced frequency. The seasonality of viral infections overall remains a mystery, with theories suggesting that cold, dry weather may make people more susceptible to viral infections or that gathering indoors during winter facilitates transmission.\n\nThe main factor influencing the magnitude of a second wave of infections is the number of people actively infected by the virus in October, often referred to as the human reservoir. Limiting the number of infections now will reduce the number of infections later. Unfortunately, the U.S. is not limiting COVID-19 infections enough to avoid a severe second wave.\n\nCountries that have successfully tackled the disease have much broader testing regimes and have implemented exhaustive contact-tracing programs that identify all those potentially infected and move them to supervised facilities, often at a local hotel, where they are monitored for symptoms. As U.S. communities reopen and behavior patterns loosen, the country will be forced to face the consequences of its insufficient action.\n\nWith seven vaccines and at least one drug with prophylactic potential currently in clinical trials, efforts to develop a vaccine and drugs that may block the virus's transmission have shifted into high gear in laboratories around the world. A vaccine or prophylactic drug must be widely available by the very beginning of the season to have an impact on a second wave of U.S. infections this autumn. That will require maximum coordinated efforts by researchers, manufacturers, and regulators.\n\nWithout a medical breakthrough, the U.S. will have to prepare for the worst.",
    " Title: Senate Divisions Over Sequester Threaten to Delay Government Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing divisions within Mitch McConnell's Republican caucus in the Senate are complicating efforts to avoid the impending budget cuts, also known as the sequester. The Great Sequester pregame show in Washington is set to conclude on Thursday, with Republicans still divided over how to disarm the doomsday budget machine they constructed in the previous Congress, in collaboration with Democrats and President Barack Obama.\n\nAs the deadline for implementing the cuts approaches on March 1, Obama will meet with House and Senate leaders on Friday, while his Office of Management and Budget works to meet the deadline. New battle lines are emerging over funding the government past March 27, with Senate Democrats expressing renewed interest in moving a full-fledged omnibus spending package for the remainder of the year.\n\nHowever, Thursday in the Senate will focus on the sequester, with the debate centered more on political cover than finding solutions. The bill, which requires 60 votes for passage, is unlikely to pass due to the Republican divisions, and even achieving 50 votes for the GOP alternative will be challenging.\n\nIn an attempt to mitigate the fallout from the cuts, the GOP leadership has proposed a controversial plan to grant the White House broad authority to implement the $85.3 billion in reductions for the remainder of the fiscal year. The final 10-page bill, released Wednesday evening, requires Obama to present his own plan to achieve the same level of cuts by March 15, rather than the across-the-board sequester.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled his support for the plan early in the day, but the strategy, crafted by his ally Sen. Pat Toomey, continues to face resistance. Freshman Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Toomey rival in this case, has also proposed her own option to forestall the cuts with long-term alternative savings rather than ceding power to Obama.\n\nConservatives argue that Ayotte's bill fails to match the immediate deficit reduction promised for 2013, and McConnell has defended the Toomey approach in floor remarks.\n\nFor the moment, Republican divisions appear to be playing into the hands of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who has enjoyed surprising unity behind his own plan to forestall the cuts for 10 months by substituting a package of $110 billion in revenues and alternative savings. The plan includes a proposed 30 percent minimum tax on the wealthy and savings from farm subsidies and reduced appropriations for defense spending.",
    " Title: Media Response to Trump's Use of Hydroxychloroquine as Preventive Measure Divides Public Opinion\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced that he is taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against contracting COVID-19. The announcement has sparked a divided response, with some media outlets criticizing the president's decision while others argue for a more measured approach.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not endorsed hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently began a controlled clinical trial to determine its effectiveness. Some media outlets have criticized Trump's decision to self-medicate, with CNN columnist warning of \"the danger in Trump's decision to self-medicate.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called Trump's remarks about hydroxychloroquine \"dangerous,\" but the drug itself is no more dangerous than a vast number of pharmaceuticals used every day by millions of Americans. The New York Times' Michelle Goldberg noted that side effects of hydroxychloroquine include paranoia, hallucinations, and psychosis, but warned against drawing hasty conclusions.\n\nThe most reckless media personality on the issue has been Trump's former bestie, Joe Scarborough, who repeatedly told his audience that hydroxychloroquine will \"kill you.\" However, the FDA has not stated that hydroxychloroquine \"will kill you.\" Instead, the FDA has noted that there are elevated risks associated with COVID-19 patients taking the medication.\n\nThe conscientious way to cover Trump's hydroxychloroquine usage would be to point out that there is no proof that the drug will help treat the coronavirus, though tests are still ongoing. Instead, some media outlets have been subjected to an overwrought lecture series of nasty, childish, partisan attacks and misleading stories about a couple ingesting fish-tank cleaner.\n\nHouse speaker Nancy Pelosi has also weighed in on the issue, stating that she would rather Trump not take something that has not been approved by scientists, especially in his age group and weight group. However, hydroxychloroquine has been approved for 70 years, and every day doctors prescribe it on- and off-label. If Trump and his doctor think it's okay for him to take it, that's his business.\n\nWhether hydroxychloroquine will be useful in this particular fight is yet to be determined. However, it's important to note that COVID-19 aside, the drug doesn't \"kill people.\" It saves people. The fearmongering isn't helping anyone.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Enjoys 46-Point Lead Over Donald Trump Among Hispanic Voters, According to Fox News Latino Poll\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a new national survey of registered voters, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has widened her lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump among Hispanic voters in the presidential race. The Fox News Latino poll, released on Thursday, shows Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, enjoying an overwhelming 46-point lead over Trump and his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. The poll indicates a 66 percent to 20 percent advantage for Clinton and Kaine, marking a 7-point increase in Clinton's lead since the same poll in May.\n\nThe Hispanic vote is crucial to Clinton's electoral strategy, which aims to assemble a coalition of young voters, minorities, and women. Hispanics are the fastest-growing minority and provided heavy support that helped secure President Obama's 2012 win over Republican Mitt Romney.\n\nIn a three-way race that included Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and his running mate, Bill Weld, 16 percent of Hispanics picked the third-party candidates, while 17 percent backed the Trump ticket. Clinton's share of the vote jumped to 59 percent, according to the poll.\n\nHispanic voters in the poll overwhelmingly sided with Clinton on immigration issues, which Trump has made a cornerstone of his campaign with get-tough policies. Hispanic voters said that Clinton was better suited to improve the U.S. immigration system by a 52-point margin, 71 percent to 19 percent.\n\nThese voters also backed Clinton by wide margins on representing their views (72 percent to 14 percent), on education (73 percent to 19 percent), foreign policy (70 to 21 percent), health care (69 to 22 percent), and the economy (61 to 31 percent).\n\nAlfonso Aguilar, the executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, told Fox News Latino that the results are not surprising given the reaction of Latinos to some of Trump's proposals.",
    " Title: Medicare for All: A Comprehensive Look at Bernie Sanders' Proposed Healthcare Plan\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders has proposed a healthcare plan, often referred to as Medicare for All. However, the term may be misleading, as the plan encompasses more than just an expansion of Medicare.\n\nCurrently, Medicare is a government program that provides healthcare coverage for seniors and the disabled. The costs of Medicare are projected to increase significantly over the next few decades. According to estimates, outlays for Medicare are expected to grow by nearly a third as a share of the economy over the next 10 years, and double over the next 30 years.\n\nRevenues for Medicare, on the other hand, are expected to lag behind these costs. The Medicare trust fund is projected to run out of money by 2029. It is unclear whether the U.S. can afford Medicare as it currently exists, let alone the expansion proposed by Sanders.\n\nSanders' proposal goes beyond merely including the entire U.S. population in Medicare, which would increase the number of recipients sixfold in just four years. His plan also includes coverage for dental, vision, and hearing needs, which are currently excluded from Medicare. Sanders promises \"no more copays, no more deductibles, and no more fighting with insurance companies when they fail to pay for charges.\"\n\nUnder Sanders' proposal, the government would pay for all healthcare expenses, not just for 55 million people but for 325 million. This would include not only the current expenses but also new ones, as relieving patients of any financial obligation would likely induce more people to seek more care.\n\nA study by the Kaiser Family Foundation notes that Medicare has relatively high cost-sharing requirements for covered benefits and does not limit beneficiaries' annual out-of-pocket spending. In 2010, the average recipient paid $2,746 for deductibles, coinsurance, and the like (not counting premiums).\n\nThe proposed plan has no price tag, which is a notable shortcoming. Americans might appreciate the additional benefits offered by the plan, but they may not be willing to pay for it. The survival of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) serves as a reminder of the importance of caution and the danger of overpromising when it comes to healthcare reform.\n\nThe ACA, once unpopular, gained broad support as Americans came to see it as an incremental and fiscally restrained method of expanding healthcare coverage with minimal disruption. The failed Republican effort to repeal and replace the ACA offers useful lessons, particularly the importance of caution and the danger of overpromising.\n\nDemocrats have an understandable attraction to a single-payer healthcare system, but embracing such a system may win votes in the short run while inviting failure in the long run. Good politics often make for bad policy, and bad policy, ultimately, is bad politics.",
    " Title: Georgia, Texas, Kentucky, and Arkansas Hold Primaries; Stacey Abrams Wins Democratic Gubernatorial Primary in Georgia\n\nArticle:\n\nVoters in Georgia, Kentucky, and Arkansas cast ballots in primaries on Tuesday, while Texas held a primary runoff election. President Trump won each of the four states in 2016, but Democrats are eyeing potential pickup opportunities in congressional races while making a closely watched play for the governor's mansion in Georgia.\n\nIn the marquee race of the night, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams scored a resounding primary victory, bringing her one step closer to becoming the nation's first African American woman governor if she wins in November. Her campaign is significant, not only for its historic nature, but for the way she's campaigning. She is focusing on expanding the electorate by mobilizing non-voters, including more people of color.\n\n\"We are writing the next chapter of Georgia's future where no one is unseen, no one is unheard, and no one is uninspired,\" Abrams said during a rousing speech at her post-election party.\n\nProgressives who have argued the path to victory for Democrats is engaging a new coalition of voters, rather than chasing Republican-leaning voters, say Abrams' campaign could serve as a model for future campaigns in the South. Several progressive groups endorsed Abrams in the primary along with 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Clinton recorded a robo-call for her the day before the election.\n\nAbrams has an uphill battle in a red state that has never elected a woman governor. In November, she will face either Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle or Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the Republicans who advanced to a runoff primary on July 24.\n\nIn the 7th Congressional District runoff, lawyer Lizzie Pannill Fletcher's defeat of writer and organizer Laura Moser ends a chapter in a high-profile drama that divided left-wing and establishment Democrats. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC)\u2014the party's House campaign arm\u2014did not want Moser to win. In February, the organization took the extraordinary step of releasing opposition research against Moser, infuriating liberals who endorsed her. They argued Washington, D.C., Democrats were interfering with the will of voters. The DCCC's chairman, Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, defended the decision, saying Moser's \"offensive\" writings would disqualify her.\n\nOn Tuesday, after the results were in, Lujan released a statement saying Fletcher is \"in a very strong position for the general election.\"\n\n\"Lizzie won her competitive primary by talking straight to voters in Houston about the issues that actually matter to their economic security, health, and children's future,\" Lujan said.\n\nHouse Democrats, who need a net gain of 23 seats to win the majority, are eyeing possible pickup opportunities in this district and two others where Clinton won in 2016. Candidates included in the DCCC's \"Red to Blue\" program, which gives top-tier candidates organizational and fundraising support, won in the two other runoff primaries. They are Gina Ortiz Jones, who served as an Air Force intelligence officer in Iraq, in the 23rd Congressional District, and civil rights attorney and former NFL linebacker Colin Allred in the 32nd Congressional District's runoff primary.\n\nAmong the winners are Ortiz Jones; former combat rescue pilot Mary Jennings \"MJ\" Hegar, a Texas Democrat; retired Navy Seal Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican; and retired Marine Lt. Col. Amy McGrath, a Kentucky Democrat.\n\n\"With these wins, we are not only one important step closer to electing four more compelling veterans to Congress, but we are also one step closer to reversing the record-high dysfunction and polarization in this country,\" said Rye Barcott, a former Marine and founder of the super PAC \"With Honor.\" The cross-partisan organization endorsed each of the candidates in its bid to increase the number of next-generation veterans in Congress.\n\nMcGrath gained a national profile last year with an introductory ad that went viral. The Naval Academy graduate and former fighter pilot described her 89 combat missions after her congressman told her when she was 13 that women shouldn't be allowed to serve in combat. If Ortiz Jones wins in November, she will be Texas's first openly LGBTQ person of color elected to Congress, according to the Human Rights Campaign.",
    " Title: NRA Endorses Bipartisan Bill to Strengthen Federal Background Check System and Mental Health Provisions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) has endorsed a bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Mark Pryor (D-AR), and Mark Begich (D-AK) to strengthen the federal background check system and prevent individuals deemed mentally ill from purchasing firearms.\n\nThe bill, which clarifies the circumstances under which someone loses the right to own a firearm due to mental illness, expands the definition of those adjudicated \"mentally incompetent\" to include individuals judged to be a danger to themselves or others, found not guilty in a criminal case by reason of insanity, and those who require involuntary outpatient treatment by a psychiatric hospital.\n\nChris W. Cox, the NRA's chief lobbyist, stated, \"This bill will create accurate definitions of those who pose serious threats and should be barred from the ability to buy or possess a firearm, while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens and veterans. This legislation will significantly improve the National Instant Check System, which is critically needed.\"\n\nSenator Graham acknowledged the emotional nature of the issue, stating, \"But I am hopeful this is one area where we can find tremendous bipartisan support to fix what I think is a gaping gap in our law.\"\n\nSenator Begich added that the bill creates a clear definition of mental incompetence, only applying to individuals who are committed to treatment involuntarily. It does not affect those in a mental institution for observation or those who voluntarily admit themselves to a psychiatric hospital. Individuals can also regain their right to own a firearm once they have recovered from their mental illness.\n\nThe bill is set to be considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, a day after the announcement, alongside four other gun-related measures. The bill is being negotiated by Democratic Sens. Charles E. Schumer of New York and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, as well as Republicans Mark Kirk of Illinois and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.\n\nSenator Graham expressed openness to considering other gun-related measures, stating, \"Tom Coburn is a good friend, and anything that Tom Coburn thinks is a good idea, I will certainly look at closely. If they can ever reach a bipartisan agreement about the problem with the background checks, I would be open to looking at their work product, but I would say this, as my colleagues have said\u2014we have a background check system that really doesn't create any deterrent.\"\n\nNeither Senator Schumer, who is carrying the bill, nor Senator Coburn immediately responded to a request for comment on Wednesday.",
    " Title: U.S. and Mexico Hold Second Day of Talks on Trade and Migration, with Tariff Threat Looming\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican officials held a second day of talks on trade and migration on Thursday, with markets rebounding on optimism a deal could be close, although it was unclear if Mexican pledges to curb migration flows were enough to persuade the Trump administration to postpone tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. has threatened to impose 5% tariffs on all Mexican exports to the United States starting on Monday if Mexico does not increase efforts to stem an increase in mostly Central American migrants heading for the U.S. border. Bilateral talks in Washington began on Wednesday to attempt to strike a deal, with the Mexican government, U.S. business groups, and even many of Trump's fellow Republicans keen to avert the tariffs, the prospect of which has rattled global financial markets.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence said Mexico had offered \"more\" on Thursday than on Wednesday, but it would be up to Trump, who returns from a European trip on Friday, to decide if it were enough. \"There has been some movement on their part. It's been encouraging,\" he said. \"The discussions are going to continue in the days ahead.\"\n\nMexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told reporters the Mexican government had offered to send 6,000 members of the National Guard to secure its southern border with Guatemala. In a sign of a wider crackdown, the leftist administration of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said earlier that it blocked the bank accounts of 26 people for alleged links to human trafficking, while it detained on Wednesday at least 350 migrants crossing into Mexico and arrested two prominent migrant rights activists.\n\nAhead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Trump is eager to show progress on his 2016 campaign pledges to take a hard line on immigration. Apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border hit a decade high in May.\n\nIf the tariffs go ahead, the United States would be in a serious trade dispute with both China and Mexico - two of its three top trading partners. Trump said on Thursday he would decide later this month whether to carry out his threat to hit Beijing with tariffs on at least $300 billion in Chinese goods.\n\nOfficials of the U.S. Federal Reserve and International Monetary Fund separately warned on Thursday that global trade tensions and rising tariffs posed an increasing risk to decades of U.S. expansion, as well as to the global economy. Analysts warn that tariffs could spark a recession in Mexico. Credit ratings agency Fitch downgraded Mexico's sovereign debt rating on Wednesday, citing trade tensions among other risks, while Moody's lowered its outlook to negative.\n\nThe White House has drafted a document for Trump that would declare a new national emergency to implement the Mexican tariffs, according to a copy of the order seen by The Hill newspaper. The head of the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee vowed to take steps to block such a move. \"If the president does declare a national emergency and attempt to put these tariffs into place, I will introduce a resolution of disapproval to stop his overreach,\" said the panel's chairman, Democrat Richard Neal.\n\nMexican officials have prepared a list of U.S. products that may face retaliatory tariffs if talks do not end in agreement. The tariffs would target U.S. products from agricultural and industrial states regarded as Trump's electoral base, a tactic China has also used with an eye toward the president's 2020 re-election bid. U.S. hog farmers fear Mexico could hit back on products like pork. Mexico bought about $1.5 billion worth of American hams and other pork products in 2017, making it the sector's top export market by volume. \"People are really scared,\" said Nick Giordano, vice president and counsel for global government affairs at the National Pork Producers Council. \"This is generating a tremendous amount of uncertainty and potentially if this goes forward, it's going to be financial turmoil.\"",
    " Title: Tulsi Gabbard Advocates for Immediate End to Regime Change Wars in Middle East\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a question directed towards Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) inquired about their stance on ending regime change wars. Both candidates seemed to evade a clear response.\n\nWarren expressed the U.S. should not maintain a military presence in the Middle East, but suggested a gradual and careful withdrawal of troops. Buttigieg argued that a hasty withdrawal, as currently ordered by President Donald Trump, would betray Kurdish allies and represent a breach of the U.S.'s commitment.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden later criticized Gabbard, stating that the U.S.'s involvement abroad was not solely for the defense of the Kurds, but to tie terrorists down and prevent them from causing harm domestically. Biden's remarks were less persuasive due to his initial confusion between Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nGabbard was the only candidate on the stage Tuesday night to advocate for a unilateral, immediate end to the disastrous policy of intervening in every conflict in the Middle East with the goal of changing regimes. She highlighted the failures of such policies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and potentially Syria.\n\nGabbard also called out both parties and the mainstream media for their role in the U.S.'s foreign policy interventionism. She criticized The New York Times for labeling her an \"Assad apologist\" and \"asset of Russia,\" stating that the attacks were \"completely despicable.\"\n\nAs Christian Britschgi of \u2588\u2588\u2588 noted earlier this week, The New York Times' attack on Gabbard was based on \"a mix of thin evidence, guilt by association, and conspiratorial framing of actions that any single-issue-focused dark horse candidate is liable to do.\"\n\nGabbard, a progressive on domestic policy, supports policies that are often at odds with libertarians. However, among the Democratic candidates, on the specific issue of regime change abroad, Gabbard is nearly the sole advocate for foreign policy that is realistic about the manifest failures of the U.S.'s approach to the Middle East since at least the turn of the century.",
    " Title: Justice Department Investigates Possible Russian Disinformation to Clinton Campaign During 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nAttorney General William P. Barr has revealed that the Justice Department is examining the possibility that Russian operatives provided disinformation to the Hillary Clinton campaign during the 2016 presidential election season. This expanded review focuses on the activities of the FBI during the summer of 2016, which included key decisions made by vehemently anti-Trump FBI senior officials in the investigations of Mrs. Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nOne significant question arises from the extent to which the FBI relied on the dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, which contained information from Russian sources and contributed to the Trump-Russia collusion narrative. The dossier was funded by payments from the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee hidden in campaign finance reports behind payments to a law firm.\n\nRepublican senators suggest that Mr. Steele's Russian sources may have intentionally fed him disinformation, which then reached the highest levels of the FBI. Former FBI Director James B. Comey's first personal interaction with Mr. Trump was to brief him on the Steele dossier shortly before his inauguration in January 2017.\n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chamber's senior Republican, stated, \"That's the definition of collusion.\"\n\nMr. Barr stated that he does not know the answer, but he is concerned about this aspect and does not consider it entirely speculative. \"That is one of the areas that I'm reviewing,\" he told the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nDemocrats expressed dismay at the prospect of a counterinvestigation. They believe the focus should remain on Mr. Trump and his team's efforts to coordinate with Russia in 2016 and then obstruct the subsequent investigation. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Kremlin ran a major disinformation campaign in 2016 to hurt Mrs. Clinton and boost Mr. Trump in the race.\n\nSen. Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, referred to the Republican efforts as \"the so-called lock-her-up defense,\" a reference to a popular Trump campaign trail chant against Mrs. Clinton for her use of a secret unsecured email account while she served as secretary of state under President Barack Obama.\n\nMr. Durbin stated, \"That's old news. That is totally unresponsive to the reality of what the American people want to know.\"\n\nMr. Barr was on Capitol Hill to testify about his handling of special counsel Robert Mueller's final report on the Russian hacking operation, submitted to the Justice Department in late March and revealed to the public in lightly redacted form two weeks ago.\n\nMr. Mueller concluded that despite their shared interest in defeating Mrs. Clinton, there was no evidence that Mr. Trump or his aides coordinated efforts with Moscow in the election. Mr. Mueller stated there was evidence that Mr. Trump tried to hinder investigations into Russia and his presidential campaign, but he did not reach any firm conclusions on criminality. Mr. Barr, however, did reach conclusions, saying it would have been impossible to make a prosecutable case.\n\nThis, ironically, is the same conclusion Mr. Comey came to in 2016 when he exonerated Mrs. Clinton for her emails. It was later revealed that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump campaign figures several weeks afterward, though the agency never informed Mr. Trump or his team.\n\nMr. Barr described the zealous pursuit of Mr. Trump as the work of a few high-placed officials who engaged in \"overreach\" \u2014 and who have since been ousted from their jobs.\n\n\"It was a few people in the upper echelons of the bureau and perhaps the department,\" he said. \"But those people are no longer there.\"\n\nMr. Barr previously revealed that he was looking into FBI and Justice Department decisions surrounding the 2016 campaign. Congressional Republicans have long pressed the theory that the FBI investigation began illegitimately, fueled by agents who were intent on discrediting the Republican nominee.\n\nMr. Barr said he will piggyback on the work of the inspector general and investigations completed by congressional committees and Mr. Mueller. Those promises are likely to thrill Mr. Trump, who has long maintained that any criminal behavior during the campaign is connected to Mrs. Clinton.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee made payments \u2014 hidden in campaign finance documents behind a law firm \u2014 to Fusion GPS, a Democratic research operation that paid Mr. Steele to investigate reports of Mr. Trump's financial links to Russia. Mr. Steele produced the dossier that claimed secret meetings between Trump campaign figures and Russian operatives and suggested salacious events such as blackmail-style tapes of a Trump encounter with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room. The Mueller report found no evidence to corroborate either of the allegations.\n\nMr. Barr stated he will review how and when the FBI learned of the Democratic backing for the Steele dossier. The attorney general also stated Mr. Trump probably should have been briefed on Russian meddling in the election, including efforts to reach out to his campaign.\n\n\"I can't fathom why it did not happen,\" he said. \"If you are concerned about interference in the election and you have substantial people involved in the campaign who are former U.S. attorneys, you had three former U.S. attorneys there in the campaign. I don't know why the bureau would not have gone and given a defensive briefing.\"\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican, asked whether Mr. Barr would support a change to legislation mandating that presidential nominees be given those kinds of briefings as a matter of course, given foreign governments' interests in subverting U.S. elections.\n\n\"The danger from countries like China, Russia, and so forth is far more insidious than it has been in the past because of nontraditional collectors that they have operating in the United States, and I think most people are unaware of how pervasive it is and what the risk level is,\" he said. \"I think it actually should go far beyond even campaigns where people involved in government have to be educated on this.\"",
    " Title: President Obama to Address 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington, Discussing Progress and Remaining Challenges in Civil Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama will stand in the symbolic shadows of Martin Luther King Jr. and Abraham Lincoln on Wednesday, as he marks the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. The event will serve as an opportunity for Obama to celebrate the progress made due to the civil rights movement, while discussing the work that still needs to be done to realize King's dream of racial justice in America.\n\nObama's speech will focus on issues such as protecting voting rights and creating opportunities for economically disadvantaged individuals of all races, which he refers to as \"ladders of opportunity.\" The president does not often discuss race publicly, but it is a subject he has thought and written extensively about.\n\nDuring a college visit in New York last week, an African-American professor asked Obama where he thought the country was in terms of civil rights. Obama's response was complex, acknowledging the significant strides made but also emphasizing that discrimination still exists and has left lasting barriers to success.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin verdict last month, Obama spoke in personal terms about the experience of being profiled as a black man in America. His remarks were praised in some quarters but criticized in others. Abigail Thernstrom, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights appointed by President George W. Bush, expressed criticism, stating, \"I do not think that the racial climate in this country is helped when the president wades in to what are always turbulent racial waters and stirs things up.\"\n\nHowever, Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher disagreed, arguing that resistance to open discussions about race is one reason the country has not made more progress. \"It's a conversation that makes a lot of white America uncomfortable and they would rather not have,\" said Belcher. \"And understand, they have not had to have the conversation.\"\n\nIn addition to addressing race, Obama has not shied away from discussing problems within the African-American community, particularly the high rates of poor choices made by young men. In May, he told graduates of Morehouse College that \"there's no longer any room for excuses.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Obama is expected to discuss civil rights in broader terms, encompassing not just blacks and whites but also Latinos, women, and gays. He is likely to reiterate his belief that all individuals are \"tied in a single garment of destiny,\" a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. However, Obama has also warned in recent weeks that persistent economic anxiety threatens to unravel the unifying fabric of the nation.\n\nObama is expected to leave his audience with the challenge of renewing the promise of civil rights, a promise that King spoke of 50 years ago.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Voter ID Requirement for North Dakota Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to overturn a lower court's ruling that allows North Dakota to enforce its voter identification requirement during the 2018 elections. The decision came in response to a group of Native American residents' challenge of a new state law that mandates voters to present identification with a current residential street address.\n\nThe challengers argued that the new rule disproportionately affects Native American voters, as many live on reservations without standard addresses. The District Court initially agreed and temporarily blocked the North Dakota secretary of state from enforcing the new requirements during the primary elections. However, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that court order last month.\n\nThe challengers requested the Supreme Court to overturn the 8th Circuit's stay, arguing it has left thousands of Native American voters unable to cast ballots. The court, however, denied the request without explanation. The court's newest member, Brett Kavanaugh, did not take part in the decision.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, on the other hand, filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Elena Kagan. Ginsburg stated that she would have granted the challengers' request, citing potential voter confusion and the risk of keeping people from voting due to conflicting court orders affecting elections.\n\n\"The risk of voter confusion appears severe here because the injunction against requiring residential-address identification was in force during the primary election and because the Secretary of State\u2019s website announced for months the ID requirements as they existed under that injunction,\" Ginsburg said.\n\n\"Reasonable voters may well assume that the IDs allowing them to vote in the primary election would remain valid in the general election,\" she added.",
    " Title: Wall Street Economists Rate Government Dysfunction as Leading Risk Factor for 2014 Economic Growth\n\nArticle:\n\nThe improving economy, defying the political turmoil in Washington, has led to a decrease in the jobless rate, rising house prices, a soaring stock market, and overall economic growth that surpassed expectations. The latest employment report showed a gain of 203,000 jobs in November and a significant drop in the jobless rate to 7 percent, suggesting the economy has overcome the most recent political challenges.\n\nHowever, the numbers may not be as positive as they seem, and there are still risks that could negatively impact the economy in 2014. Government dysfunction remains the leading risk factor, according to Wall Street economists.\n\nJan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, stated, \"The economy is improving right now because the headwinds from Washington are getting much smaller. If you look at the broad range of indicators, there is more good news than bad news. And everyone assumes a deal gets made on the sequester and the budget. But that's not a certainty, and so Washington remains a risk.\"\n\nThe current economic data, including Thursday's surprisingly strong 3.6 percent read on gross domestic product growth, is reported despite Washington's dismal state. The 16-day government shutdown that featured 850,000 furloughed workers is expected to take a quarter point bite out of GDP growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhile much of the fallout may show up in the fourth quarter, it's also easy to overstate the strength of recent data. The big third-quarter GDP number received a boost from companies stocking up on inventory expecting an uptick in demand. That inventory building will not recur in subsequent quarters, meaning even without the shutdown impact, fourth-quarter growth is likely to be closer to 1 percent than 3 percent. Consumer spending rose just 1.4 percent in the third quarter.\n\nThe November jobs report, however, was uniformly good news, with the unemployment rate falling to its lowest level in five years because more people found jobs, not because they left the labor force as in some previous months. Total employment measured by the household survey increased by 818,000, the biggest jump in three decades, partially driven by furloughed workers returning to the job after the government shutdown.\n\nDespite the positive job report, not everyone is optimistic about the economic outlook for 2014. Catherine L. Mann, professor of economics at Brandeis University, stated, \"I'm not so sure that 2014 prospects are all that much better than 2013 given that the underlying drivers of growth including consumption, business investment, and exports continue to be very weak. And there is still going to be an awful lot of noise and partisanship and Washington basically being a burr under the saddle of the economy for all of next year.\"\n\nOne hope for 2014 that underlies much of the Wall Street bullishness is that congressional negotiations led by House Budget Committee Chair Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray can make a deal to reduce the immediate impact of the 2014 sequester spending cuts on the economy. Reports suggest they are only a few billion dollars in budgetary savings away from an agreement, with their official deadline next Friday.",
    " Title: Trump Threatens Legal Action Against Pelosi and Schiff Over Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has threatened to sue House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) over the ongoing impeachment inquiry. The threat was made during a speech at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"We're going to take a look at it. We're going after these people. These are bad, bad people,\" Trump said, referring to Pelosi and Schiff. \"I actually told my lawyer, I said sue [Schiff] anyway. I said, even if we lose, the American public will understand.\"\n\nTrump's comments come amid a wave of revelations regarding his efforts to encourage Ukraine to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son. Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry last month, following a whistleblower complaint within the intelligence community that focused on the president's interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe inquiry centers around allegations that Trump carried out a broad effort to pressure Zelensky to find dirt on the Biden family. A White House memorandum of the leaders' July 25 phone call confirms that Trump asked Zelensky to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr on the probe.\n\nMultiple House committees, including the one led by Schiff, have called for documents and depositions from numerous Trump administration officials as part of the inquiry. However, the White House has vowed not to cooperate.\n\nTrump has repeatedly decried the impeachment inquiry, often referring to it as a \"coup\" and a \"witch hunt.\" During a campaign rally on Friday, he suggested that the impeachment inquiry showed Pelosi \"hates the United States of America.\"\n\nPelosi's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's latest remarks. The U.S. Constitution stipulates that members of Congress cannot be impeached.",
    " Title: White House Pushes for Comprehensive Gun Violence Plan Amidst Ongoing Discussions on Gun Control Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration is actively seeking ideas for a comprehensive plan to address gun violence, with Vice President Joe Biden's task force reportedly focusing on various gun control measures. This week, Biden is set to meet with gun safety organizations, gun violence victims' groups, and gun ownership groups, as well as representatives from the entertainment and video game industries.\n\nThe White House has vowed to produce a comprehensive plan by the end of the month, following the Newtown, Conn., school shooting massacre that left 20 children and six adults dead. The administration is also considering examining mental health and the entertainment industry in addition to gun control measures.\n\nWhile much of the discussion and proposed measures revolve around gun control, the White House is reportedly considering measures beyond reinstating a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. These measures may include universal background checks for gun buyers, a national gun database, strengthening mental-health checks, and tougher penalties for people carrying guns near schools or giving them to minors.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated on Monday that President Obama wants to \"close the many loopholes in our background check system\" and \"supports congressional actions right away.\" However, accelerated efforts to draft new gun control measures have alarmed gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stated that the next round of fiscal deadlines will occupy Congress's attention and push off the consideration of gun legislation for at least three months. The White House, however, maintains that the president still plans to act quickly on Biden's proposals.\n\nBiden's recommendations are expected to include both legislative proposals and executive actions that Obama can sign into law without lawmakers' approval. In addition to Biden's meetings this week, other meetings are scheduled with education, health, and community organizations, as well as business owners and religious leaders. Pro-gun lawmakers on Capitol Hill have said any comprehensive effort to respond to the Newtown shooting must include more than just tighter gun control.",
    " Title: Former Defense Secretary Mattis Breaks Silence, Criticizes President Trump's Response to George Floyd Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement released over the weekend, former Defense Secretary James Mattis, who served under President Donald Trump, has publicly criticized the President's response to the police killing of George Floyd and the subsequent protests. Mattis, who was known for his silence regarding Trump during his tenure, has now broken that silence, citing the direct threat the American experiment faces due to the President's actions.\n\nMattis, who served in the military for over five decades, swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. In his statement, he expressed his dismay that troops taking the same oath could be ordered to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens. He also criticized a photo op involving the President, military leadership, and troops during the protests in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe former Defense Secretary implicitly criticized the current Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, and other senior officials as well. He emphasized that the military should not be used to \"dominate\" cities, and that public order should be maintained by civilian state and local leaders who best understand their communities and are answerable to them.\n\nMattis's dissatisfaction with Trump was not a secret within the Pentagon during his tenure. After his resignation, he argued against criticizing a sitting president, stating it would threaten the apolitical nature of the military. However, he acknowledged that there would be a period of silence, which he referred to as not eternal. That period, according to Mattis, is now definitively over.\n\nIn his statement, Mattis contrasted the American ethos of unity with Nazi ideology, quoting instructions given to troops before the Normandy invasion that emphasized unity as a strength, while the Nazi slogan was \"Divide and Conquer.\" He urged Americans to summon this unity to surmount the current crisis, confident that they are better than their politics.",
    " Title: College Education and the Production of Personality: A Neutral Assessment\n\nArticle:\n\nWhen evaluating the merits of attending a university in America or the Western world, a crucial question to consider is the type of person the institution produces. This question, regardless of political affiliation, is one that parents can agree on, as they may disagree about the desired outcome but share a common interest in the character development of their children.\n\nThe author of this article, Dennis Prager, a nationally syndicated radio talk-show host and columnist, expresses his belief that colleges today often produce individuals who are no better or wiser than when they graduated high school. He cites college drinking, sexual activity, depression, and mental illness as areas of concern.\n\nAlcohol Rehab Guide, an online alcohol addiction site, reports that a large percentage of college students engage in binge drinking, with 80% consuming alcohol to some degree and 50% engaging in binge drinking. The site also states that college environmental factors contribute to heavy, frequent, and abusive drinking.\n\nRegarding sexual activity, the author mentions the sexual encounters that often result from college drinking, which can lead to regret, particularly by the woman.\n\nThe author also discusses the mental health crisis among college students, citing clinical psychologist Gregg Henriques' claim that there is a mental health crisis facing America's college students, with higher levels of stress and psychopathology compared to any time in the nation's history.\n\nThe author questions whether college students and recent graduates return home as more respectful, grateful, or open-minded individuals. He suggests that the answers to these questions are essential for parents to determine whether they want to risk sending their child to a place that may increase the chances of depression, binge drinking, and character degradation, while also potentially instilling political and social views that may conflict with their own.\n\nThe author acknowledges that students pursuing STEM fields may need to attend college, but for most others, sending a child to college is a gamble with their values, character, and even their joy of life.

    " Title: U.S.-Taliban Negotiations: Analysis of Canceled Camp David Summit and Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe cancellation of a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Taliban leaders at Camp David has sparked criticism from some political circles, with skepticism towards any potential deal with the Taliban and criticism of Trump's diplomatic efforts.\n\nThe cancellation followed a suicide bombing last week that killed a U.S. soldier and several civilians, which Trump blamed for the cancellation. However, some sources suggest that Trump may have gotten cold feet at the last minute about an agreement that could be perceived as a resurgence of al-Qaida and Islamic State in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Trump administration's approach to the Taliban has been criticized for attempting to thread an impossible needle: negotiating with the Taliban while ensuring Afghanistan does not become a \"Harvard for terrorists.\" The Taliban has consistently refused to negotiate directly with the Afghan government, despite the fact that the outcome of their talks with the United States will deeply affect the Afghan people and the Afghan government they represent.\n\nThe canceled Camp David talks were intended to bring Taliban leaders and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani together. The cancellation may have benefited Ghani, who is running for reelection at the end of this month and may well win. The winner of the election will be in a stronger position to insist that the next round of negotiations with the Taliban must include the duly elected Afghan government.\n\nTrump's dealmaking skills, which he touted during his 2016 campaign, have come under scrutiny in light of the canceled summit. He has been unable to secure a new nuclear deal with Iran, has made little progress in getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear arsenal, and his trade talks with China are going nowhere.\n\nIn the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances of the U.S.-Taliban negotiations are likely to become the focus of investigation. Some argue that circumstantial evidence, such as the timing of the bombing and the cancellation of the summit, is enough to support impeachment proceedings. However, whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.\n\nThe full article was written by Nahal Toosi, Anita Kumar, Wesley Morgan, and Victoria Guida for Politico. The article concludes by stating that a withdrawal from Afghanistan that does not safeguard women's rights, women's rights, and legitimate Afghan governance would prove disastrous for both Afghans and America.",
    " Title: Mueller Suggests Subpoenaing President Trump for Grand Jury Testimony\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, it has been reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller suggested to President Donald Trump's legal team that he could subpoena the president to appear before a grand jury if he refuses an interview with investigators regarding the Russia probe. This escalates tensions over the investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, John Dowd, Trump's former lead attorney, disclosed this information during a meeting with Trump's legal team in March. The Washington Post and Fox News have reported accounts of the meeting, with the latter confirming the details. Dowd reportedly responded to Mueller's suggestion by stating, \"This isn't some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.\"\n\nDowd resigned as Trump's lead lawyer weeks later amid a dispute over how to answer Mueller's request for a presidential interview. The possibility of a subpoenaed appearance by the president adds to the ongoing investigation's tension.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Tuesday that attorney Jay Sekulow, who now leads Trump's legal team, compiled a list of potential questions that Mueller's team wishes to ask Trump. The list includes questions about Trump's interactions with key figures in the Russia saga, such as former FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn.\n\nThe questions also touch on Trump's businesses and his discussions with his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, about a possible Moscow real estate deal. Cohen's business dealings are part of a separate FBI investigation. The list includes questions about any meetings Trump may have had with Russian President Vladimir Putin and what the president may have known about a possible attempt by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to set up a back channel with Russia before Trump's inauguration.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Trump described the leaked list of potential questions as \"disgraceful.\" In a brief phone conversation with Fox News, Dowd denied leaking the list to the media and denied being the source of the initial Washington Post report on the Mueller meeting.",
    " Title: Lobbying Firm Awarded Grant for Obamacare Navigator Services\n\nArticle:\n\nA registered lobbying firm, Chatman LLC, has been awarded a half-million-dollar grant by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to help enroll people for Obamacare as Affordable Care Act \"navigators.\" The firm, which lobbies CMS on behalf of a private hospital client and has also lobbied on the health care law itself, was found to be the only registered lobbying firm among more than 100 organizations receiving grants last month to help the public apply for Obamacare coverage.\n\nCraig Holman, legislative representative for the watchdog group Public Citizen, stated that it is unusual for a lobbying firm to secure a government contract, but the company may have won the grant due to its grass-roots outreach apparatus. The firm was awarded the grant to provide navigator services in Delaware.\n\nMr. Holman suggested additional restrictions on Chatman LLC, including segregating lines of business and ensuring that no grant money can be used toward lobbying. He noted that federal law prohibits the firm from making any contributions to any federal political committee, including super PACs, due to its status as a government contractor.\n\nNavigators, including Chatman LLC, are barred from lobbying on behalf of the health insurance industry and must adhere to strict conflict-of-interest standards, according to CMS spokeswoman Rachel Maisler. She stated that navigators are an important resource to help Americans learn about their health insurance options, enroll in the Marketplace, and find the plan that is best for themselves and their families.\n\nCMS awarded the grants competitively and stated that Chatman LLC was in compliance with all conflict-of-interest rules. Chatman LLC did not respond directly to questions from The Times about whether its lobbying work surfaced during the grant application process. Instead, the firm released a statement highlighting its relevant experience in the rollout of private insurance plans and work experience in Medicaid and reaching consumers with low health literacy.\n\nAccording to the firm's lobbying disclosure forms, Ms. Chatman works for the Livingston Group\u2014another lobbying firm\u2014on behalf of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. CMS was the only federal agency that the firm lobbied during the most recent quarter, along with the Senate and House. During the summer, the firm filed a separate disclosure form showing it had lobbied, among other issues, on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRecent weeks have seen scrutiny of several recipients of the CMS grants. The New York Post reported that Seedco, a community development group that won contract work to enroll people for Obamacare, had been sued by the federal government on claims of fraud. Seedco told the paper that it had made important changes, including installing new management.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have raised questions about whether organizations and navigator personnel have been vetted properly. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) stated, \"It is simply astounding that the administration is urging the American people to give their Social Security numbers and sensitive personal information to people who have not been properly vetted.\" Last week, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-CA), ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called on Republican House members to correct \"inaccurate statements\" about the navigator program.",
    " Title: YouTube's Decision to Terminate Steven Crowder's Partner Program Sparks Debate on Free Speech and Market Competition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, YouTube has decided to terminate American conservative commentator Steven Crowder's eligibility for its Partner Program, citing violations of its policies. This move has sparked a debate on the role of free speech and market competition in the digital age.\n\nThe argument posits that, as YouTube is a privately-owned company, it has the right to regulate the content on its platform. Comparing this to electric companies refusing service to homes with political signs, proponents of free markets argue that such restrictions on expression by privately-owned enterprises should be objected to.\n\nThe crux of the argument lies in the nature of certain markets. In markets characterized by \"bigger is better\" economics, where size bestows advantage, refusing service to a few customers can impose significant costs on competing businesses and potentially leave those customers unserved. This is particularly relevant in the case of social media platforms, which benefit from network externalities, making it difficult for rivals to establish themselves.\n\nCritics argue that being excluded from popular social media networks can impose a significant cost on individuals, as the entire point of these platforms is to communicate with others on the network. While it's easy to switch between burger joints, the same may not be true for social media platforms, where the value of the platform is proportional to the number of customers on it.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the comparison between electric power and social media access is not exact. While food is more important than power, social media is crucial for many in contributing to the national political debate. Anonymity normally protects consumers from offending big business, but social media companies can potentially identify and ban users, setting their followers count back to zero and destroying the influence they have built up.\n\nEconomic blogger Tyler Cowen suggests that, despite social media deplatforming, information technology has given us far more publishing options than we had even in the 1990s. He argues that, given long-term leftist control of most of the media, right-of-center commentators may currently be better situated than any time in the recent past.\n\nThe debate over internet censorship and free speech is complex and multifaceted. As technology continues to evolve, the role of social media platforms in shaping public discourse and the potential for censorship becomes increasingly significant. It is a topic that requires careful consideration and ongoing discussion.",
    " Title: Intelligence Community Warned of Coronavirus Threat in January and February, Reports Show\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies had been warning of the potential danger posed by the novel coronavirus throughout January and February, while the White House downplayed the threat and was slow to roll out nationwide measures, according to reports by The Washington Post.\n\nU.S. officials familiar with spy agency reporting told The Washington Post that the reports did not specify when the virus might spread in the U.S. or recommend specific steps to prevent an outbreak. However, they did track the international spread of the coronavirus and warned that China was initially dismissing the seriousness of what is now a pandemic.\n\nPresident Donald Trump took early action to close the border to any travelers from China, where the coronavirus first appeared, but the White House was slow to make test kits available and ceded much of the response to state governments.\n\nA U.S. official who had access to intelligence reporting told the Post, \"Intelligence agencies have been warning on this since January. Donald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were \u2014 they just couldn't get him to do anything about it.\"\n\nThe White House has defended the president's response, dismissing claims that the administration was caught flat-footed and insisting that Trump took early and significant action.\n\n\"President Trump has taken historic, aggressive measures to protect the health, wealth, and safety of the American people \u2014 and did so while the media and Democrats chose to only focus on the stupid politics of a sham illegitimate impeachment,\" Hogan Gidley said in a statement to the Post. \"It's more than disgusting, despicable, and disgraceful for cowardly unnamed sources to attempt to rewrite history \u2014 it's a clear threat to this great country.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Defends Syria Withdrawal, Visits Iraq Amidst Ongoing Middle East Policy Shift\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprise trip to Iraq, President Donald Trump defended his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, where they have been aiding in the battle against Islamic State militants. During a visit to a western Iraq base, Trump told American servicemen and women, \"We're no longer the suckers, folks.\" He added, \"We're respected again as a nation.\"\n\nTrump stated that U.S. military gains enabled the withdrawal of 2,000 forces from Syria. This marked his first visit to a troubled region, and he also expressed no plans to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq.\n\nAt al-Asad Airbase west of Baghdad, Trump said, \"I made it clear from the beginning that our mission in Syria was to strip ISIS of its military strongholds.\" He further stated, \"Eight years ago, we went there for three months and we never left. Now, we're doing it right, and we're going to finish it off.\"\n\nTrump indicated that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has agreed to take out \"any remnants\" of IS left in Syria. The U.S. presence in Syria was not intended to be \"open-ended,\" Trump said, adding that other wealthy nations should pay for rebuilding Syria.\n\n\"The nations of the region must step up and take more responsibility for their future,\" said Trump, who stated there would be a \"strong, deliberate, and orderly withdrawal\" of U.S. forces from Syria.\n\nTrump's trip to Iraq came a week after he announced the U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria, a move that reportedly led Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign. Trump's decision has rattled allies worldwide, including in Iraq.\n\nTrump's trip was kept secretive. Air Force One flew overnight from Washington, landing at an airbase west of Baghdad under the cover of darkness Wednesday evening. It was his first visit with troops stationed in a troubled region.\n\nFifteen years after the 2003 invasion, the U.S. still has more than 5,000 troops in Iraq supporting the government as it continues the fight against remaining pockets of resistance by the Islamic State group. IS has lost significant territory in Iraq and Syria but is still considered a threat.\n\nTrump, who often expresses his support for the U.S. military, had faced criticism for not yet visiting U.S. troops stationed in harm's way as he approaches his two-year mark in office. He told The Associated Press in October that he \"will do that at some point, but I don't think it's overly necessary.\" He later signaled that such a troop visit was imminent.\n\nTrump had initially planned to spend Christmas at his private club in Florida, but he stayed behind in Washington due to the shutdown. It's unclear whether his trip to Iraq was added after it became apparent that the government would be shut down indefinitely due to a stalemate between Trump and congressional Democrats over the president's demand for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAdding to the tumult, the stock market has been experiencing heavy losses due to concerns about a slowing global economy, Trump's trade war with China, and the president's public slamming of the Federal Reserve and its chairman over interest rate hikes by the independent agency.\n\nTrump's visit comes at a time when his Middle East policy is in flux. He went against the views of his top national security advisers in announcing the Syria withdrawal, a decision that risks creating a vacuum for extremists to thrive. There are dire implications, particularly for neighboring Iraq. The Iraqi government now has control of all the country's cities, towns, and villages after fighting its last urban battles against IS in December 2017. However, its political, military, and economic situation remains uncertain, and the country continues to experience sporadic bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations, which most people attribute to IS.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi recently said Iraqi troops could deploy into Syria to protect Iraq from threats across its borders. Iraq keeps reinforcements along its frontier to guard against infiltration by IS militants, who hold a pocket of territory along the Euphrates River.\n\nTrump campaigned for office on a platform of ending U.S. involvement in foreign trouble spots, such as Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The Syria decision will ultimately affect all of the approximately 2,000 troops deployed in the war-torn country. The Pentagon is also said to be developing plans to withdraw up to half of the 14,000 American troops still serving in Afghanistan.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump blamed Democrat Hillary Clinton for the rise of IS, due to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011 during her tenure as secretary of state. President George W. Bush set the 2011 withdrawal date as part of an agreement with the Iraqi government to gradually shrink the U.S. footprint and slowly hand off security responsibilities to the government and Iraqi security forces. His successor, President Barack Obama, wanted to leave a residual force in Iraq to help the government manage ongoing security challenges. However, he ultimately went ahead with the scheduled pullout in 2011 after Iraqi political leaders rejected terms the U.S. sought for legal protections for the U.S. troops that would have remained.\n\nTwo of Trump's recent predecessors visited Iraq early in their terms. Bush visited Iraq in November 2003, about eight months after that conflict began. Due to security concerns, Bush waited until 2006 to make his first visit to Afghanistan. Obama visited Iraq in April 2009, the first year of his eight years in office, as part of an overseas tour. He visited Afghanistan in 2010. Vice President Mike Pence visited Afghanistan in December 2017, not long after Trump outlined a strategy to break the stalemate in America's longest war. Pence met with Afghan leaders and visited with U.S. troops stationed in the country. Trump has not visited Afghanistan.",
    " Title: Nurses Speak Out Against Police Violence During Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nRegistered nurse Asantewaa Boykin, a member of the National Nurses United (NNU), found herself in the midst of tear gas during a protest in Sacramento, California. The incident occurred when protesters, who were marching for an end to police violence, were met with tear gas fired by the Sacramento police.\n\nBoykin, who has been a social justice advocate longer than she has worked in the emergency department at Sacramento's UC Davis Medical Center, has witnessed various forms of violence against protesters during her work as a protest medic. She has seen injuries ranging from skull fractures caused by police projectiles to abrasions from protesters falling while running to avoid being shot or gassed.\n\nThe NNU, the largest union of registered nurses in the country, represents Boykin and 150,000 other nurses. The union advocates for the health and safety of protesters, who are also their patients. Tear gas, a chemical weapon that has been proven fatal in documented cases and is banned in warfare, is one of the weapons used by police departments across the country on protesters.\n\nTear gas can cause symptoms including vomiting, blurred vision, shortness of breath, tearing, difficulty swallowing, temporary blindness, pain, coughing, and sneezing. During a pandemic, when it's critical not to spread the virus causing COVID-19, the use of tear gas poses a significant risk.\n\nIn addition to tear gas, militarized police have used flashbangs (stun grenades) and rubber bullets, which have been responsible for deaths, internal bleeding, organ damage, and bruising. These weapons can cause burns, hearing loss, temporary blindness, injuries from shrapnel, and death.\n\nNurses have witnessed these violent police tactics in various locations and during different protests, including Occupy Wall Street, Standing Rock, and the U.S.-Mexico border. At Standing Rock in 2016, nurses met Vanessa Dundon, whose eye was shot out by a tear gas canister fired by police.\n\nNurses are calling for an end to police violence against protesters, stating that it not only costs lives but also perpetuates inequalities and injustices. Chronic stress alone can cause vast negative health impacts for individuals and communities brutalized by the police.\n\nHeather Honstein, RN, a cardiovascular surgical ICU nurse at Washington D.C.'s MedStar Washington Hospital, joined protesters peacefully in Lafayette square near the White House on June 1. Honstein, an NNU member, left the area 30 minutes before federal police violently dispersed the peaceful crowds.\n\nAs nurses, we could never have predicted that we would simultaneously be on the front lines of a pandemic at work and the front lines of a local battlefield in our free time. However, in 2020, this is the reality.\n\nThe only people who come to protests dressed for war are police officers, and their use of force against protesters exercising their constitutional right to assembly is a threat to democracy. It's also a colossal waste of public resources that would be far better spent on public health and other social programs, especially during a pandemic and economic crisis.\n\nBonnie Castillo, RN, the executive director of National Nurses United, emphasizes that standing up for racial justice and the issues that matter should not be lethal in any amount.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Agree to 90-Day Trade War Ceasefire, Expect Immediate Action on Tariffs and Intellectual Property\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States expects China to take immediate action to cut tariffs on U.S. car imports and end intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers as the two countries move toward a broader trade deal, a White House official said on Monday. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday agreed to a ceasefire in a trade war that has seen the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods between the world's two largest economies disrupted by tariffs.\n\nThe two leaders agreed to hold off on imposing more tariffs for 90 days starting Dec. 1 while they negotiate a deal to end the dispute following months of escalating tensions. Global markets rose on Monday to their highest levels in about three weeks on the news. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite all gained more than 1 percent.\n\nU.S. soybean futures rose to their highest level since at least August, part of a broader commodities rally. China offered more than $1.2 trillion in additional commitments on trade at the dinner between Xi and Trump on Saturday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Monday. White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the figure was a broad benchmark that would depend on private transactions for U.S. goods and was subject to market conditions.\n\nChina committed to start lifting tariffs and non-tariff barriers immediately, including reducing its 40 percent tariffs on autos, Kudlow said. \"We expect those tariffs to fall to zero,\" he told reporters. Americans would get a majority ownership in Chinese companies for the first time, Kudlow said on CNBC. Mnuchin, also speaking on CNBC, hailed a shift in tone.\n\nTrump has made improving the terms of trade for the United States a signature of his \"America First\" presidency and has prided himself on confronting Beijing over trade practices that the United States and its allies complain are unfair. \"My meeting in Argentina with President Xi of China was an extraordinary one,\" Trump tweeted on Monday. \"We are dealing from great strength, but China likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed. Level the field!\"\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Tuesday referred questions on the details of the trade agreement to the commerce ministry, which has yet to provide any. He reiterated that during the meeting the two leaders agreed their economic teams would step up talks to work toward getting rid of all the tariffs, and aim for a mutually beneficial deal so that trade and economic relations can get back on a \"healthy\" track as soon as possible.\n\nKudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said he, Mnuchin, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer held private meetings in Argentina with China's Vice Premier Liu He, who told them Beijing would move quickly on its new commitments. \"The history here with China promises is not very good. And we know that,\" Kudlow said. \"However, I will say this: President Xi has never been this involved.\"\n\nKudlow said: \"They can not slow walk this, stall this, meander this. Their word: 'immediately.'\" U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a working dinner after the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina December 1, 2018. \u2588\u2588\u2588/Kevin Lamarque\n\nAdministration officials expressed a mixture of skepticism and optimism on Monday over whether China would deliver. None of the commitments were agreed to in writing and many specifics have yet to be worked out. Kudlow said U.S. officials would monitor Chinese progress closely.\n\nNegotiators will actually have less than 90 days to reach a deal because of holidays in both countries over the next three months, Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, told reporters on Monday. Trump has appointed Lighthizer, who just completed a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico and is one of the administration's most vocal China critics, to oversee the new round of talks, officials said. The appointment may signify a harder line with Beijing and marks a shift from the past, when Mnuchin had a lead role.\n\n\"He's the toughest negotiator we've ever had at the USTR and he's going to go chapter and verse and get tariffs down, non-tariff barriers down and end all these structural practices that prevent market access,\" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told National Public Radio on Monday. The White House is stepping up efforts to prod other countries to build more vehicles in the United States. Lighthizer and other officials, including Kudlow, are set to meet with German automakers, including the chief executives of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Daimler AG, on Tuesday, people briefed on the matter said.\n\nKudlow said the meeting was not meant to focus on potential tariffs, though Trump still had that option in his \"quiver,\" and the automakers would be encouraged to build engines in the United States. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that China had agreed to cut import levies on American-made cars. Chinese regulators did not respond to requests for comment on the tweet. Neither country mentioned auto tariffs in their official briefings of the meeting on Saturday.",
    " Title: U.S. President Donald Trump's Actions Spark Political Uncertainty and Calls for Oversight\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past 100 days of President Donald Trump's administration, the country has experienced a series of events that have raised concerns about the president's actions and their potential impact on U.S. politics and foreign relations. The focus of the first 100 days was on policy-making, with the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee, the addressing of foreign-policy challenges, and the hashing out of healthcare reform.\n\nHowever, in the last ten days, the country has been embroiled in a political maelstrom, with the president's character and actions taking center stage. The firing of FBI Director James Comey, the disclosure of classified information to the Russians, and the alleged attempt to influence an FBI investigation have sparked a wave of controversy and calls for oversight.\n\nThe firing of James Comey was met with criticism due to the perceived impulsive and potentially politically motivated nature of the decision. The president's subsequent contradiction of his staff's statements regarding the dismissal has led to layers of falsehoods, giving the impression of an elaborate cover-up.\n\nThe disclosure of classified information to the Russians has also caused concern, but the long-term impact on U.S. intelligence relationships remains uncertain. The president's disclosure of sensitive information to the Russians has been compared to past incidents, such as the spilling of secrets during the Obama administration, with little lasting damage to U.S. intelligence relationships.\n\nThe most recent controversy involves the alleged attempt by President Trump to influence an FBI investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. The White House has issued a statement denying the allegations, but the lack of a signed statement from administration officials has raised questions about the credibility of the denial.\n\nThe political turmoil has led to calls for increased oversight and strengthening of the \"guardrails\" of the U.S. political system. Some have suggested the use of the 25th Amendment to remove the president, but this idea has been met with criticism for potentially undermining the democratic process and the fixedness of the presidential term.\n\nThe political landscape remains uncertain, with the president's behavior causing concern and calls for increased oversight. The long-term impact of these events on U.S. politics and foreign relations remains to be seen.",
    " Title: U.S. Revokes Travel Privileges for Bill Browder, Stirring Controversy on Capitol Hill\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States government has revoked the travel privileges of Bill Browder, a prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, causing concern on Capitol Hill. Browder, a key advocate for the Magnitsky Act, found himself barred from traveling to the United States in recent days.\n\nThe situation appears to be a response to Russia's decision to place Browder on the Interpol wanted list in pursuit of his arrest. In a statement on Monday, Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) called for an immediate review of Browder's visa status, stating that it would be unfortunate if the U.S. decided to bar him based on a decision by the same Russian officials targeted by the Magnitsky Act.\n\nBrowder, a British citizen, was notified late last week that his status as a member of the Global Entry program, administered by Customs and Border Protection, had been revoked. When Browder attempted to book a flight to the United States, he discovered that his entry privileges as a British citizen had been revoked. Browder uses the Electronic System for Travel Authorization to gain entry into the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program.\n\n\"I discovered that my Global Entry status had been revoked,\" Browder said. \"We then checked into a flight to Newark and the airline wouldn't let me check in, wouldn't let me board because of the visa issue.\"\n\nBrowder added that he learned of Russia's actions on October 17, when they added him to the Interpol diffusion system.\n\nBill Browder is a British financier who has been a major driving force behind the Magnitsky Act, a bipartisan law passed in 2012 to punish human rights abusers in Russia. The law is named for Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was jailed after discovering a tax fraud scheme and who died under suspicious circumstances. Browder was one of Magnitsky's clients.\n\nBrowder's support for the law has made him an enemy of Moscow. Russia has on four previous occasions petitioned to get Interpol to secure Browder's arrest, though the international police organization has rejected the requests, deeming them politically motivated.\n\nIn the past, Browder's visa privileges were revoked as a result of Russia's actions, but he said the U.S. government previously had resolved the issue within hours.\n\n\"I am hopeful that this is just a technical issue driven by Interpol and it will be resolved quickly,\" Browder said Monday.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for more information. Browder said he received little information from Homeland Security when he inquired about his Global Entry status in recent days.\n\n\"After waiting for an hour and a half, I got through to a representative who told me that they couldn't disclose why my Global Entry had been revoked, and if I wanted to find out, I should file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request,\" Browder said. \"I only learned why when I went to my law enforcement contacts about Interpol.\"\n\nBrowder discovered that he had again been targeted by Russia just after Canada passed its version of the Magnitsky Act last week. Russia is seeking Browder's arrest on charges of tax evasion and murder.\n\nIn a public address on Thursday, Putin accused Canada of playing \"unconstructive political games\" and derided Browder as a criminal. The revelation that Browder's visa had been revoked triggered immediate scrutiny among critics of the Trump administration.\n\n\"This is outrageous. @realDonaldTrump, @StateDept et al, fix this now. Now. Do not join Putin's campaign against @Billbrowder,\" tweeted Michael McFaul, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Moscow under the Obama administration.",
    " Title: North Korea's Internet Service Restored After Days of Outage\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing more than nine hours and 30 minutes of downtime, Internet service has been restored in North Korea, according to technology news service Dyn Research. Although access is currently partial, the country's main news service and newspaper have reportedly returned online.\n\nEarlier reports suggested that North Korea's Internet access became unstable late on Friday, with the service becoming completely offline by Monday, as per multiple news outlets. San Francisco-based CloudFlare, a network and security company that monitors global Web access, told The New York Times that North Korea's Internet access was \"toast.\"\n\nThe cause of the outage remains unclear. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf stated today, \"We are not going to discuss publicly operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way except to say that as we implement our responses, some will be seen, some may not be seen.\"\n\nIn an interview with NPR's Elise Hu, Matthew Prince, the chief executive of CloudFlare, outlined four possible scenarios: North Korea turned off its own Internet; China's upstream provider turned it off; the country's routers failed at an unfortunate time; or it was the result of a denial-of-service attack from either a hacking group or the U.S. Prince expressed doubt that the U.S. was behind the reported outage.\n\nNorth Korea has one of the lowest Internet penetrations in the world, with access limited mostly to the country's elite. The U.S. has linked the recent hacking of Sony Pictures to North Korean hackers, though North Korea itself has denied responsibility. There are computer security experts who question whether Pyongyang is behind the hack.\n\nLast week, Sony canceled the planned Christmas Day release of The Interview, a comedy that centers on a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The decision followed threats against moviegoers and theaters that showed the film. The threats were attributed to the group that claimed responsibility for hacking Sony.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Grants Stay on Injunction Against Military Funding for Border Wall Construction\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has granted the Trump administration's request to stay a district court's permanent injunction against the diversion of $2.5 billion in military spending for the construction of portions of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. This decision allows the wall construction to proceed.\n\nThe background of the case is as follows: When President Trump announced his intention to build the border wall without specific congressional authorization, he identified multiple funding sources, including $2.5 billion under the Department of Defense funds transferred for Counterdrug Activities and $3.6 billion reallocated from Department of Defense military construction projects under the President's declaration of a national emergency. The case at hand concerns the $2.5 billion transferred under the Counterdrug Activities provision.\n\nThe Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition filed a lawsuit, alleging that the funding diversion would harm the environment and constituted an improper and unlawful diversion of funds in violation of specific congressional appropriations. However, private parties do not have the right to challenge administration expenditures without demonstrating that they have suffered a concrete and legally recognized injury as a result of the government's action. In this case, it is less clear how the plaintiffs themselves were harmed by the government's action.\n\nJustice Breyer, in his partial concurrence and partial dissent from the Supreme Court's decision, noted that the case raises \"novel and important questions about the ability of private parties to enforce Congress' appropriation power.\"\n\nIn its application for a stay, the Trump administration argued that the \"injunction was entered at the behest of private parties whose asserted recreational and aesthetic interests in the enjoyment of public lands do not fall within the zone of interests protected by the transfer statute, and who are thus not, in any event, proper plaintiffs to sue to enforce the conditions in that statute.\"\n\nFive justices of the Supreme Court agreed, at least for now, holding that it \"among the reasons\" it granted the stay \"is that the Government has made a sufficient showing at this stage that the plaintiffs have no cause of action to obtain review\" of the relevant administrative action.\n\nIt is important to note that this decision is not a final judgment for the administration, nor does it represent a ruling that the administration's diversion of funds was lawful. The stay remains in effect while the Ninth Circuit decides the case and until ultimate disposition in the Supreme Court.\n\nThis decision casts substantial doubt on whether the plaintiffs are the right parties to seek to protect Congressional authority. The Supreme Court may ultimately decide this case on the merits, but for now, it is right to cast doubt on a sweeping lower-court injunction granted on behalf of plaintiffs who have yet to adequately articulate the legally recognized harms they have suffered in what is ultimately a battle between Congress and the President of the United States.",

Reports indicate that Ms. Hayes accepted nearly $200,000 in payments from green nonprofits to work on controversial low-carbon fuel standard policies, while the administration was promoting new legislation on the issue.\n\nThe official announcement has not been made public, but sources with direct knowledge of the matter told local news station KOIN 6 that Mr. Kitzhaber met with administration officials on Friday morning to discuss his plans. His resignation will take effect at 10 a.m. on Wednesday.\n\nUpon Mr. Kitzhaber's resignation, Oregon Secretary of State Kate Brown is expected to assume the office, becoming the nation's first openly bisexual governor. Oregon Senate Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli expressed his sentiments on Friday morning, stating that \"what should be a day of celebration is turning into a day of reflection and mourning.\"\n\nFerrioli told a gathering of the Oregon Wheat Grower League outside the capitol that he would not attend Ms. Brown's swearing-in ceremony but instead would return home \"to grieve for the departure in disgrace of one governor and to hope for the healing that can only come if the next governor turns away from policies that put symbolic gestures ahead of the real needs of our citizens.\"\n\nOregon House Republican Leader Mike McLane described the situation as \"a sad day for Oregon.\" He stated, \"I take no delight in John Kitzhaber's resignation but understand his decision.

    " Title: Supreme Court Declines to Hear Challenge to Origination Clause of Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to take up an appeal that argues Congress violated the Constitution by initiating the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in the Senate rather than the House. The Pacific Legal Foundation, which filed the appeal, contends that the Affordable Care Act of 2010, with its revenue-raising provisions, falls under the Founding Fathers' vision of the origination clause, which requires money bills to originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nLower courts have previously ruled that the primary purpose of the law is to increase health insurance coverage, not to generate revenue. They also found that Congress used an acceptable maneuver to bypass the origination clause, as the key language of Obamacare originated in the Senate.\n\nThe Pacific Legal Foundation's plaintiff, Matt Sissel, is an Iraq War veteran and small business owner who objects to being forced to purchase health insurance under the individual mandate, which imposes a tax penalty on those who do not have coverage. The foundation argues that Sissel does not need or want health insurance.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit dismissed Sissel's suit in August, stating that the primary purpose of the law was not to raise money. Other judges on the panel suggested that Obamacare should be labeled a revenue bill, but concluded that Congress did not violate the origination clause, as the Senate inserted text into a legislative shell from the House.\n\nSo far, opponents of the overhaul have not had much success before the high court. The justices upheld the law as constitutional in 2012, although the court allowed states to choose not to expand Medicaid under the law. Last year, plaintiffs in King v. Burwell argued that the law's text limited subsidies to states that set up their own exchanges. However, the court ruled that the law, when read in its entirety, allowed qualified Americans to qualify for tax credits regardless of where they live.\n\nThe Constitutional Accountability Center stated on Tuesday that \"the ultimate outcome of challenges like this one aren't in doubt,\" suggesting that opponents of Obamacare should cease their legal efforts. Elizabeth Wydra, the center's chief counsel, described the challenges as \"meritless.\" She added, \"The Court upheld the ACA for the second time just last June, with Chief Justice Roberts picking up a sixth vote to send a clear signal that he's had enough of what has become a blatant ideological crusade. One questions whether anti-Obamacare legal activists have gotten the message.\"",

The ad rates for \"Morning Joe\" on MSNBC have more than doubled post-election, while the rates for \"The O'Reilly Factor\" and other prime-time programs on Fox News have boosted their rates about 50 percent.\n\nTrump, who reportedly watches these shows regularly, has a close relationship with \"Morning Joe\" host Joe Scarborough and is known to respond directly to what he sees on television and tweet about it. These tweets often drive news coverage during the day.\n\nSome companies are proactively placing ads on \"O'Reilly\" and \"Morning Joe\" to reach the president, according to the consultant. One source at MSNBC acknowledged that ad rates for \"Morning Joe\" would likely increase due to strategically placed ad buys in New York and D.C. Fox News declined to comment.\n\nThe consultant stated, \"Instead of lobbying through the usual channels, it's like speaking directly into the president's ear.\" He also mentioned that some companies are placing ads to avoid a Trump tweet or, in at least one instance, trying to prompt Trump to tweet against their competitors.\n\nThis strategy allows advertisers to potentially influence the president and his top lieutenants, as Trump's media habits are predictable, according to the media buyer.",
    " Title: Camp David: A Venue for High-Stakes Diplomacy Through the Ages\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington \u2013 The proposed meeting between President Donald Trump and the Taliban at Camp David, though ultimately scrapped, would not have been the first instance of high-stakes diplomacy at the presidential retreat. Built during the Great Depression by the Works Progress Administration, Camp David, nestled in a national park in Maryland, has been a venue for presidents to engage in delicate negotiations on various global issues.\n\nCamp David, initially named Shangri-La by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, has hosted world leaders since its conversion into a presidential retreat. In 1943, Roosevelt welcomed British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, as Germany advanced across Europe during World War II. The Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum houses a photograph of the two leaders fishing at the retreat, with Roosevelt holding a fly rod and Churchill his trademark cigar.\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower, who renamed the retreat Camp David after his father and grandson, met with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev there in 1959. At a time of high Cold War tension, the two leaders made some progress, such as agreeing to open talks on the administration of war-torn Berlin. However, much of the goodwill was lost when an American U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union months later.\n\nPerhaps the most famous international gathering to take place at Camp David happened under President Jimmy Carter. In 1978, Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the site to broker a peace accord named for the retreat. The touch-and-go negotiations took place over 12 days, all in secret.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton attempted to recreate the sense of momentum in the Middle East with his own summit in 2000, but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat failed to reach an agreement. Eisenhower wasn't the only president to host Russians at Camp David. President George W.

    " Title: Conservative Groups Scramble to Prove Election Impact as Spending Reaches $1 Billion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 election, outside groups, including super PACs and nonprofits, are facing the possibility of spending over $1 billion without electing Mitt Romney or delivering a GOP Senate. As a result, these organizations are taking steps to prove their impact and justify their substantial spending.\n\nFor two years, these groups have maintained a secretive approach, withholding details about their methods, strategies, and donors. However, in light of the potential failure to elect Romney and secure a GOP Senate, some groups have begun to disclose their spending. For instance, Americans for Prosperity, a political group associated with the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, has revealed details about its $72 million worth of ad buys.\n\nOperatives running these super PACs and nonprofits are seeking to demonstrate their effectiveness in various ways, positioning themselves to claim credit for successes, dodge blame for failures, and show that they are not limited to narrowly targeted advertising.\n\nKarl Rove's Crossroads outfit, which primarily focused on television ads supporting Romney and GOP Senate candidates, has expanded its activities to include House races and get-out-the-vote efforts, collaborating with Ralph Reed's evangelical mobilization group, Faith and Freedom Coalition.\n\nA coalition of groups within the Koch brothers' network, including Americans for Prosperity, 60 Plus, Concerned Women for America, and CitizenLink, recently met to discuss strategies for demonstrating their value to donors.\n\nThe pro-Romney Restore Our Future super PAC has been highlighting to donors the role its advertising in Michigan and Wisconsin played in making those states competitive, while the American Future Fund has distinguished itself by spending on anti-Obama ads in traditionally Democratic states like Minnesota.\n\nAs the election nears its end, operatives, donors, and fundraisers anticipate a significant reshuffling of the conservative groups that benefited from an unprecedented influx of cash due to wealthy Republicans' antipathy towards President Barack Obama and the 2010 Citizens United decision's loosening of campaign finance rules.\n\nIdaho businessman Frank VanderSloot, who has contributed $1.1 million to Restore Our Future and hinted at donations to Crossroads, stated, \"Without question, after it's over, there is going to be a sorting out of who got the job done, and I think there will be some who might lay claim to accomplishments that they maybe didn't personally accomplish.\" He added, \"Some of these organizations will gain in stature, and some will probably fall by the wayside.\"",
    " Title: Special Counsel Acquires Communications of Erik Prince in Russian Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly obtained the communications of Erik Prince, the founder of private military contractor Blackwater and a close ally of President Donald Trump. According to a report by The Daily Beast, Prince has cooperated with the special counsel's investigation, providing them with access to his phones and computer.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, a Prince spokesman confirmed that Prince has spoken voluntarily with Congress and cooperated with the special counsel's investigation. The spokesman added that Prince has opinions about the various investigations but will keep them to himself to allow the investigators to do their work.\n\nThe statement also noted that much of the reporting and speculation about Prince in the media is inaccurate and expressed confidence that when the investigators have finished their work, they will be able to put the distractions to the side.\n\nIn March, Mueller's probe reportedly uncovered evidence that a secret meeting in Seychelles shortly before President Trump's inauguration was intended to create a back channel between the incoming administration and the Kremlin. The January 2017 meeting between Prince and a Russian official close to strongman Vladimir Putin was coordinated to discuss how the Trump administration could communicate with Moscow, according to a Washington Post report.\n\nPrince has previously told Congress that the meeting with Kirill Dmitriev, the Putin-appointed head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, was a chance encounter \"over a beer.\" However, ABC News reported earlier this year that Mueller had obtained evidence that created doubt about that testimony.\n\nInvestigators believe the meeting was intended to establish a line of communication between the countries that was outside normal diplomatic channels. The information came to light after it was revealed that Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, a representative of the United Arab Emirates who was part of the Seychelles meeting, was cooperating with Mueller's probe under immunity.\n\nIt was unclear whether Mueller's office would prosecute Prince or make a referral to the US attorney for the District of Columbia if they found convincing evidence of perjury, according to ABC News.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, welcomed the renewed focus on Prince. \"I have a lot of questions about whether he was being straight with us,\" Swalwell told ABC News. \"I'm heartened to hear that the special counsel is doing what Republicans on the committee were not willing to do... and follow up and not take Mr. Prince at his word.\"",
    " Title: Obama Seeks Limited Ground Operations Authorization in Iraq and Syria Against Islamic State\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has requested Congressional authorization for limited ground operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, marking a departure from his predecessors' approach to war powers. Over the past six months, the United States military has conducted more than 1,900 airstrikes in the region without explicit Congressional approval.\n\nIn a letter to lawmakers on Wednesday, Obama reiterated his belief in the authority under current law to conduct such a campaign. However, he emphasized the need for bipartisan support and differentiated his current request from previous presidents' actions.\n\n\"It is not the authorization of another ground war, like Afghanistan or Iraq,\" Obama said in remarks from the White House. While he has sent 2,600 American troops back to Iraq in a support role, he stated, \"I'm convinced that the United States should not get dragged back into another prolonged ground war in the Middle East.\"\n\nObama also clarified that his mission does not entail \"enduring offensive ground combat operations.\" In a letter to Congress accompanying the proposal, he envisioned the possibility of limited ground action, such as rescue operations or the use of Special Operations forces to take military action against Islamic State leadership. He also allowed for the use of ground forces for intelligence gathering, spotting ground targets for airstrikes, and planning assistance to ground troops of allies like the Iraqi government.\n\n\"If we had actionable intelligence about a gathering of ISIL leaders, and our partners didn't have the capacity to get them, I would be prepared to order our special forces to take action,\" Obama said in his remarks, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State. \"I will not allow these terrorists to have a safe haven.\"",
    " Title: Cruz Wins Wisconsin Primary, Altering GOP Presidential Race Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Ted Cruz has been projected to win the Wisconsin primary Tuesday, marking a significant shift in the Republican presidential race as it moves east later this month. Networks called the race shortly after polls closed at 9 p.m. Eastern Time, based on exit polling that showed Cruz with a substantial lead. With 37 percent of the precincts reporting, Cruz led Donald Trump by 53 percent to 30 percent, followed by John Kasich with 15 percent.\n\n\"Tonight is a turning point. Tonight is a rallying cry,\" Cruz said at his election night party. \"It is a call from the hardworking men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America: We have a choice, a real choice.\"\n\nCruz attributed his victory to his growing momentum and highlighted the support he has received from five of his former GOP presidential rivals, as well as recent wins in Utah, Colorado, and North Dakota. Cruz stated that he is confident he will earn the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination before the Republican National Convention.\n\n\"Either before Cleveland or at the convention in Cleveland, together we will earn the majority of the delegates and together we will beat Hillary Clinton in November,\" Cruz said.\n\nCruz emphasized that his victory signifies the consolidation of anti-Trump voters within the GOP behind his bid. Trump, however, was unable to recover from a difficult week that included his campaign manager being charged with simple battery and his own stumbles on abortion and other conservative issues. Trump also faced questions about his declining poll numbers among female voters, leading him to bring his wife, Melania, onto the campaign trail.\n\nThe Cruz victory makes it more challenging for Trump to win the nomination outright on a first ballot at the July convention. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the third man in the race, has vowed to stay in the race despite another loss.\n\n\"The nomination contest is now wide open,\" Kasich campaign strategist John Weaver said in a memo issued just before polls closed. \"This week will be remembered as the one in which Ted Cruz and Donald Trump both effectively admitted they will not reach the GOP Convention with enough bound delegates to be the nominee.\"\n\nKasich argues, and polling confirms, that he runs the best of the three GOP candidates against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. However, GOP primary voters have shown little interest in this aspect, focusing instead on choosing their champion.\n\nExit polls from Wisconsin revealed that 56 percent of GOP voters believe the candidate who has collected the most votes in the primaries should win the party's nomination. Four in ten favored a contested convention, where delegates would select the nominee.\n\nTrump's proposals, such as a temporary freeze on non-US Muslims entering the country, were popular among seven in ten voters, according to exit polls. Trade was a significant concern for over half of Republican voters, who felt the United States was receiving a raw deal in trade agreements.\n\nSix in ten GOP voters supported offering a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, a higher percentage than in most other primary states. A third called for their deportation. Half of the voters sought a candidate with political experience, and about half wanted a candidate from outside the political establishment.\n\nCruz was viewed as the GOP's best hope to beat Hillary Clinton in a general election match-up, followed by Trump and Kasich, according to exit polls.",
    " Title: Indictments and Political Fallout: A Look at the Impact of Recent Developments on the Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of events reminiscent of the political scandals that rocked the U.S. Congress in 2006, a flurry of legal actions has taken place in August 2018, potentially impacting the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nOn August 21, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was convicted by a federal jury, and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to additional charges. Subsequently, Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr., R-Calif., and his wife Margaret Hunter were indicted on charges of using campaign funds for personal expenses. These developments follow the arrest of Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., on insider trading charges two weeks prior.\n\nThe charges against Hunter and Collins have no connection to the cases involving Manafort and Cohen. However, their early endorsements of President Trump have raised questions about the potential political motivations behind the indictments.\n\nIn a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Hunter's attorney, Gregory Vega, argued that the indictment was \"politically motivated\" due to Hunter's early endorsement of President Trump. Vega contends that the indictment means \"a solidly Republican district is being handed to a Democratic candidate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, stated, \"Today he [Cohen] stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election.\" Davis' statement implies a potential connection between Cohen's actions and those of the president.\n\nThe 2006 midterm elections saw a significant shift in power, with Democrats winning control of both the House and Senate. If the current political climate mirrors that of 2006, Republicans could face a similar fate this November. However, it is essential to remember that history does not always repeat itself, and there are numerous uncertainties in the upcoming elections.\n\nSeats in Virginia, Texas, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Nevada, and Minnesota are among those in play, making it difficult to predict the outcome with certainty. Additionally, external factors such as international crises, mass shootings, or the potential for an \"October Surprise\" could significantly impact the elections.\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, the political landscape remains fluid, and the full impact of these recent developments remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Trump's Speech to Congress: A Mixed Display of Unity and Division\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, a recurring pattern emerged: whenever Donald Trump's erratic behavior and self-created controversies posed a threat to his campaign, his aides would schedule a prepared speech before a sober audience. Trump would then read a script, often appearing bored but sounding calmer and more tempered compared to his usual self. This led to speculation about a new, more presidential Trump. However, within 24 hours, the old Trump would reappear, with his characteristic rallies and petty, vindictive tweets.\n\nTuesday night's speech before a joint session of Congress was not as insincere as these earlier speeches, and it was better written, albeit with the usual load of misleading statements and inaccuracies. The speech, however, revealed the internal tension within Trump's administration, as they grappled with the desire to let Trump be Trump and the urge to present a more unifying rhetoric.\n\nThe speech began with a paragraph that seemed to be added at the last minute, addressing the recent increase in anti-Semitic incidents:\n\n\"Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\"\n\nPresident Trump's response to the rise in anti-Semitic incidents has been criticized, with him initially offering a half-hearted condemnation and later suggesting that the attacks might be false-flag operations. This implies that Trump believes Jews might be staging anti-Semitic attacks to discredit neo-Nazis.\n\nHowever, the opportunity for a unifying message was missed, as Trump could have highlighted the extraordinary reaction of local Muslims, who rallied around their Jewish neighbors to repair the damage caused by the vandalism. A reflective president might have used this opportunity to emphasize the resilience, community, generosity, and unity that can be found in America.\n\nSprinkled throughout the speech were nods at unity, such as Trump's call for cooperation and trust, and his acknowledgment of the shared American identity. Yet, these approving words were interspersed with the usual Trumpian notes of division, fear, and dismissal of those who do not already support him. It seemed as if two different speeches had been merged together.\n\nTrump spoke about the election as if only his voters went to the polls, and he described a fictitious crime wave. He also pledged to \"dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation\" and touted his new Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement office, which aims to tally and publicize crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.\n\nImagining a Victims of Black Crime Engagement or a Victims of Jewish Crime Engagement office highlights the vile nature of this initiative, as its purpose is to spread hatred and fear. This demonstrates the real Trump administration in action, reflecting Trump's heart and the divisive, fear-mongering approach that has characterized his presidency so far.\n\nWhile Trump managed to act almost presidential for an hour, there are few Americans left who believe that Trump truly wants to bring the nation together. And just wait\u2014within a matter of hours, he will be back on Twitter, and back to his true self.",
    " Title: Egypt's Interim President Appoints ElBaradei as Prime Minister, Later Reverses Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nEgypt's new interim president, Adly Mansour, has taken steps to assert his authority and stabilize the country amid ongoing political unrest. On Saturday, Mansour announced the appointment of Mohammed ElBaradei, a prominent critic of former President Mohammed Morsi, as interim prime minister. However, the appointment was later rescinded.\n\nInitially, Mansour's spokesman, Ahmed el-Musalamani, confirmed the appointment, but later denied that the decision was ever certain. Reporters gathered at the presidential palace were led into a room where they were told to wait for the president to announce ElBaradei's appointment.\n\nAccording to a senior opposition official, Munir Fakhry Abdelnur, the reversal was due to objections from the ultraconservative Salafi el-Nour party, with mediation reportedly underway.\n\nTensions remain high in Egypt, with tens of thousands of Morsi supporters rallying for a third day near a mosque in a Cairo neighborhood traditionally supportive of Islamists. The protesters chanted against Wednesday's removal of the country's first democratically elected president, General Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who has denied the military staged a coup, claiming he was acting on the wishes of millions of Egyptians protesting Morsi.\n\nNo major violence was reported on Saturday, as all sides regrouped after a night of fierce clashes between Morsi's supporters and opponents that turned downtown Cairo into a battlefield.\n\nThe youth opposition group behind the series of mass protests that led to Morsi's ouster has called for Egyptians to rally on Sunday in support of the new order.\n\nMansour, 67, the former chief justice of Egypt's constitutional court who was installed by the military as an interim leader, met with General Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, Interior Minister Mohammed Ibrahim, and the three young leaders of Tamarod, the group that organized the massive opposition protests, on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood has vowed to boycott the political process, labeling the military's actions as a coup that overthrew a democratically elected government. Morsi, a U.S.-trained engineer, remains under detention in an undisclosed location.",
    " Title: Congress Faces End-of-Year Deadline as Parties Disagree on Top Tax Rates to Avoid Fiscal Cliff\n\nArticle:\n\nCongress faces an end-of-the-year deadline as massive spending cuts are scheduled to kick in and tax breaks begin to expire, including the Bush-era tax cuts at the end of December. This looming crisis, often referred to as the \"fiscal cliff,\" also includes so-called sequestration -- automatic across-the-board spending cuts set to trigger at the beginning of 2013 if Capitol Hill fails to create a deficit-reduction plan.\n\nIn a formal speech on Capitol Hill Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner sounded conciliatory even as he made it clear higher tax rates would be unacceptable to Republicans who control the House. Boehner stated that forging a bipartisan agreement that begins to solve the problem, they are willing to accept new revenue, under the right conditions, but not from higher tax rates on higher earners.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, on the other hand, insisted that raising taxes on wealthier Americans has to be part of any compromise to resolve the crisis. Reid said, \"There was a message sent to us by the American people, based on the campaign. People making all this money have to contribute a little bit more.\"\n\nBoehner and top House GOP leaders held a conference call with all House Republicans shortly before the speaker made his speech. According to two participants on the call, the speaker gave a full readout of what he planned to say publicly, and while he reinforced his pledge not to agree to tax increases, he did urge rank and file members to give him some room to negotiate with the White House.\n\nPresident Obama weighed in as well by placing separate calls to Reid, Boehner, McConnell, and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. The White House said he told them tax increases for wealthy Americans need to be part of a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff and reduce the debt.\n\nAs part of a broader compromise, Boehner said that tax reform must be coupled with \"concrete steps to put our country's entitlement programs on a sounder financial footing.\" The speaker also expressed hope that an agreement can be reached \"that sends a signal to our economy, and to the world, that after years of punting on the major fiscal challenges we face, 2013 is going to be different.\"\n\nHowever, Boehner also said he did not think a deal could be struck in the next month and a half during a lame-duck session of Congress. Instead, he wants to reach an agreement with Democrats on a framework or bridge that would postpone the cuts and tax-rate changes for one year until a broader deal on deficit reduction -- including entitlement and tax reform -- can be worked out.\n\nThis stance is at odds with Reid, who said he opposes \"kicking the can down the road\" anymore. \"Waiting for a month, six weeks, six months, that's not going to solve the problem,\" Reid said. \"We know what needs to be done. So, I think that we should just roll up our sleeves and get it done.\"\n\nBoehner's spokesman said there are no meetings scheduled yet between the speaker and the president, and reiterated that any deal needs to be hashed out between the principals, not in a public back-and-forth series of photo ops. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell reinforced Boehner's opposition to higher tax rates and argued it's up to President Obama to \"propose a way for both parties to work together in avoiding the fiscal cliff without harming a weak and fragile economy.\"",
    " Title: Bush's Legacy Lives On Through Supreme Court Appointments, as Seen in the Confirmation of Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer President George H.W. Bush, who passed away on Friday at the age of 94, has been widely praised as the antithesis of President Donald Trump. The contrast between the two presidents, in terms of their approach to politics and their legacies, has been a recurring theme in the media.\n\nOne of the most significant similarities between the 41st and 45th presidents lies in their Supreme Court appointments. Both nominated men who were later accused of sexual misconduct, and both stood behind those men during their confirmation battles.\n\nClarence Thomas, nominated by Bush in 1991, has served on the Supreme Court for 27 years. Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by Trump in 2018, is also likely to serve for decades, outlasting Trump's presidency regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nThe appointment of a Supreme Court justice is one of the most consequential decisions a president can make, and its impact is far more enduring than the manners a president displays while in office. Bush defended Clarence Thomas after he was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill.\n\nThe nomination of Thomas was controversial from the beginning. When Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first black justice on the Supreme Court, announced his retirement in 1991, Bush could have honored his legacy by naming a respected African-American judge or legal scholar. Instead, Bush selected a staunch conservative in Clarence Thomas, who today is known as the most conservative member of the Court.\n\nAfter Thomas was nominated, news broke of Anita Hill's allegations against him. Bush was undeterred, and on October 9, 1991, he declared that he had \"total confidence\" in his nominee. On October 11, after Hill and Thomas testified before the Senate, Bush called Thomas's statement \"very powerful and convincing\" and said the nominee had been smeared.\n\nHill was mocked and criticized in the press and in the Senate, and Thomas was confirmed on October 15, 1991. He has since voted consistently against abortion rights and in favor of restrictions on campaign finance. His vote has been instrumental in several landmark cases, including Bush v. Gore, which helped George H.W. Bush's son become president of the United States.\n\nThomas is not necessarily considered influential, but his vote continues to matter. With the addition of Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, anti-abortion advocates believe they have enough votes to overturn Roe v. Wade. Thomas, a staunch opponent of abortion throughout his career, is likely to be one of those votes.\n\nThe similarities between Thomas's confirmation process and Kavanaugh's extend to the role of the president. Trump's defense of Kavanaugh in many ways mirrored Bush's defense of Thomas. Both men have succeeded in pushing onto the Court someone accused of sexual misconduct, whose decisions will affect all Americans for decades to come.\n\nBush may have been polite where Trump is crude, restrained where Trump is over-the-top. But a look at today's Supreme Court is a reminder that when it comes to a president's legacy, style matters less than substance. And there are few decisions more substantial than the decision of what kind of person deserves to spend his or her life on the country's highest court, handing down rulings that can shape the country for generations.",
    " Title: Global Carbon Emissions Remain High Despite Pandemic-Induced Decline\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic has led to a significant reduction in global carbon emissions, but experts warn that this is not enough to address climate change. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, the atmospheric concentration of carbon reached a new record of 416.21 parts per million in April, surpassing levels seen in 800,000 years based on ice core records.\n\nA new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change estimates that global carbon emissions fell by 17 percent between January and April of this year compared to daily levels in 2019. The most significant decrease was observed in the aviation sector, which makes up the smallest portion of the global footprint and saw a 75 percent decrease. Other sectors, such as ground transportation, cars, industrial manufacturing, and power demand, also experienced declines, though less dramatically.\n\nThe International Energy Agency and Carbon Brief estimate an 8 percent and 5 percent global drop in carbon emissions, respectively. Last week, the U.S. Energy Information Agency projected that carbon emissions from the electric sector alone will fall 11 percent nationally this year, and renewable energy use is on track to eclipse coal for the first time ever.\n\nHowever, these declines only put us at the 2006 carbon emissions levels, and the effects are likely to be short-lived. The extent to which carbon emissions rebound depends on how governments respond to the pandemic and climate change. If politicians choose to delay climate programs, such as weakening standards for more efficient buildings and cleaner cars, emissions could eventually rebound to levels worse than before.\n\nAccording to a study by the climate policy think tank Energy Innovation, U.S. emissions will bounce back from an 11 percent drop to business-as-usual by 2025. From 2030 on, the pandemic would have no material impact on pollution levels.\n\nMegan Mahajan, an energy policy analyst with Energy Innovation, states, \"We're still going to be relying on the same fossil fuel technology we relied on before the pandemic. The types of fuels we're relying on have not changed. There isn't a fundamental shift from how we power our electricity, our homes, and modes of transportation.\"\n\nExperts warn that more fundamental long-term transformation of the biggest climate fuels for electricity, industrial activity, and transportation is necessary to address climate change. The world needs to hit at least a 7.6 percent drop in total carbon emissions every year for the next decade to contain warming well below a disastrous 2 degrees Celsius.",
    " Title: Arizona Governor Appoints Rep. Martha McSally to Fill John McCain's Senate Seat\n\nArticle:\n\nArizona Governor Doug Ducey has appointed Rep. Martha McSally to fill the Senate seat previously held by the late Sen. John McCain. The appointment comes just over a month after McSally lost the race for Arizona's other Senate seat to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nMcSally, a two-term congresswoman, gained national attention when she faced off against Sinema in the fall, both vying for the Senate seat vacated by Sen. Jeff Flake's decision not to run for re-election. Sinema won the seat in a relatively close race, with 50 percent of the vote to McSally's 47.6 percent. McSally conceded six days after the election.\n\nWith McSally's appointment, Arizona will be one of only a few states to be represented by two women in the Senate. McSally and Sinema will be the only serving bipartisan pair of female senators representing their state. The only other instance of this happened in New Hampshire from 2011 to 2017.\n\nSen. John McCain passed away in late August, just days before the Republican primary in the race for Flake's seat. McCain held his seat for decades, but it lies within the power of the governor and not McCain's family to determine who will fill the seat until a special election can be held to formally fill it in 2020.\n\nAt a news conference today, Ducey said that he was grateful that McSally and Cindy McCain \"were able to get together and visit earlier this week and clear the air.\" Cindy McCain posted a tweet supporting the decision and calling on McSally to remember her husband's legacy.\n\nFor her part, McSally said that she looks forward to working with her recent rival Sinema, whom she accused of treason during the campaign, while they both serve as the state's representatives in the Senate for the next two years.\n\nAssuming McSally's appointment progresses, the special election for McCain's seat will be held in 2020, and then would be up for its regularly scheduled re-election in 2022. Should McSally continue forward and run for re-election, she will have campaigned three times in six years, losing once. And since McCain won his sixth term in 2016 and Sinema's seat is up for re-election in 2024, Arizonans will have gone through five Senate elections in a decade.",
    " Title: Call for Temporary Liquor Store Closures to Combat Domestic Violence During Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Fresno Sheriff's Department has reported a 77 percent increase in domestic violence incidents over the past two weeks compared to three weeks ago. Similarly, the Seattle Police Department has received 614 calls in the last two weeks, a 22 percent increase compared to the average rate. Domestic violence prevention organizations in Boston are also warning of an increase in cases.\n\nWith the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and stay-at-home orders, domestic violence rates appear to be rising. The increased confinement of families, sudden demands for home schooling, job loss, and worry over the virus are contributing factors. However, alcohol is identified as a significant aggravating factor in domestic violence incidents.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), millions of Americans are injured or beaten annually by drunken domestic partners and parents. It is estimated that just 10 percent of adults consume 75 percent of all alcohol sold, with 10 or more drinks per day. Excessive alcohol use can impair judgment, engender anger, agitation, and dysphoria, and lead to violent behavior.\n\nHistorically, reducing access to alcohol has been shown to decrease domestic violence incidents. For instance, Finland's liquor store employee strike in the 1970s and Sweden's curtailment of liquor store sales on certain days in the 1980s both led to a decrease in domestic violence incidents. South Dakota also imposed twice-daily sobriety breathalyzer checks for individuals with multiple arrests for drunk driving, which resulted in a decrease in both drunk driving rates and domestic violence incidents by about 10 percent.\n\nGiven the current pandemic situation, the increased risk of domestic violence and the challenges in identifying such incidents due to stay-at-home orders, some experts are calling for the temporary closure of liquor stores. This measure could help reduce the frequency of domestic violence incidents during the crisis.\n\nHealthcare workers, teachers, and other professionals are often the first to identify signs of domestic abuse. However, with the shift to telemedicine and virtual classrooms, victims are left in their homes with their abusers, and the privacy and confidentiality that in-person consultations provide are lost.\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings have moved online, but access to a private setting and the internet are prerequisites for participation, and not all members have these resources. A recent analysis found that AA is the most effective means to help people stay sober. Keith Humphreys, one of the authors of that report and a professor at Stanford University, stated, \"When supports for sobriety are low and alcohol supply is high, more people get intoxicated and inflict harm on themselves and their families.\"\n\nThe cascading effects of domestic violence also exacerbate the pandemic. Each house call by police or paramedics is another opportunity for the disease to spread. It consumes time and personal protective equipment that are in desperately short supply. Any preventable visit to the emergency room chokes off that bottlenecked resource. And even trips to the liquor store are an avoidable reason for people to come into contact under stay-at-home orders.\n\nBanning alcohol sales, even temporarily, will come at some cost. Liquor stores will close, and many will have to forgo their occasional glass of wine at dinner or their \"quarantini\" with a twist. However, the benefits to domestic violence victims and potential victims during this crisis should be prioritized.\n\nDoctors will need to be on the lookout for patients who may be in need of extensive assistance due to alcohol withdrawal. The treatments for withdrawal are well known, widely available, and effective. Even with these possible downsides, the benefits to domestic violence victims and potential victims whom we have few other ways of helping through this crisis should be our priority.\n\nPeter B. Bach, a physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City, emphasizes the need for a balanced approach. \"Banning alcohol sales, even temporarily, will come at some cost,\" he said. \"Liquor stores will close. Many who enjoy a glass of wine at dinner will have to forgo that pleasure for a few weeks or months. I can give up my occasionally 'quarantini' with a twist. And we can all give up the alcohol during our Zoom happy hours.\"\n\nHowever, he adds, \"With liquor stores closed, many people addicted to alcohol will have to endure the physical effects of withdrawal. For most, it lasts days and is deeply unpleasant. For about 5 percent, it can be life-threatening without medical care.\"\n\nIn conclusion, while the temporary closure of liquor stores may come with some challenges, the potential benefits in reducing domestic violence incidents during the pandemic cannot be ignored. The priority should be the safety and well-being of domestic violence victims and potential victims.",

The race was expected to be a significant lead for Clinton, with all 15 pre-election polls in Michigan this year showing Clinton leading Sanders by double digits.\n\nOn the Republican side, Donald Trump, the current front-runner, secured a convincing victory in Michigan, defeating Texas Senator Ted Cruz by 47 percent to 36 percent of the vote. Marco Rubio and John Kasich trailed behind with 9 percent and 5 percent of the vote, respectively. Trump also won Mississippi's Republican primary, while Cruz was projected to pick up a win in the Idaho GOP primary, and Trump was projected to easily win the Hawaii Republican caucus.\n\nTrump's wins in Michigan and Mississippi have increased his delegate lead over Cruz, who has been pushing to consolidate conservative support. Cruz has argued that Trump is not the candidate he claims to be. However, Trump used his wins to downplay the chances for his remaining rivals, as he and the rest of the field look ahead to next week's vital winner-take-all contests in Ohio and Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton easily won Mississippi's primary, thanks in part to her overwhelming support from black voters. She is likely to pick up more delegates in Tuesday's contests than Sanders. However, Sanders' surprising Michigan win could give him a bounce as he and the rest of the candidates charge into the vital March 15 primaries in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, and North Carolina.\n\nIn the Republican race, Trump and Cruz have been the main contenders, with Rubio and Kasich trailing behind. Rubio, who campaigned in Michigan Tuesday, told reporters he was focusing on the Midwestern states and repeated his vow to win Ohio. Kasich, who also campaigned in Michigan Tuesday, told reporters he was counting on a win in his home state of Ohio next week to salvage his campaign.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Clinton is still trying to regain her footing as Sanders has demonstrated his grassroots support in several recent contests. Over the weekend, he claimed three victories to Clinton's one. Thanks in part to so-called \"superdelegates\" - party leaders and officials free to support whomever they want - Clinton maintains a huge delegate lead over Sanders. As of early Wednesday morning, she had 1,221 to Sanders' 571.\n\nLooking ahead, Rubio rallied a home-state crowd Tuesday evening, saying: \"I believe with all my heart that the winner of the Florida primary next Tuesday will be the nominee of the Republican Party... And I need your help. I need your vote.\" Clinton, meanwhile, is still trying to regain her footing as Sanders has demonstrated his grassroots support in several recent contests.",
    " Title: Influential Church Figures Push for Recognition of Homosexual Relationships at Upcoming Vatican Synod\n\nArticle:\n\nEvidence is emerging of concerted efforts by a group of influential church figures, primarily from Germany and northern Europe, to influence the Catholic Church's stance on homosexual relationships, particularly through the upcoming church synod on the family. The group aims to make the meeting focus on same-sex relationships, while cloaking their agenda in vague and abstract language.\n\nTheir objectives include \"enriching\" the \"biblical and theological foundations\" of the synod (a euphemism for disregarding traditional church teaching), creating a \"new theology of love\" (an abstract concept aimed at legitimizing extramarital unions), and finding a \"nonhostile\" language to convey church doctrine (a watering down of Catholic teaching).\n\nWhile these figures publicly distance themselves from endorsing same-sex \"marriage,\" they support church recognition of homosexual relationships and acts, which were once considered grave sins. The October Synod on the Family, called by Pope Francis and to be attended by over 400 bishops and experts, is intended to discuss how to better pastorally apply the church's teaching on marriage and the family. However, some fear that the meeting may be derailed by powerful lobbies, some of whom are running the synod itself.\n\nOn Monday, 50 participants, including nine bishops and over 20 liberal theologians, attended a secretive \"study-day\" at Rome's prestigious Gregorian Jesuit university. During the meeting, none of those attending opposed church recognition of same-sex relationships when it was explicitly proposed by one of the speakers.\n\nThe meeting was organized at the invitation of the heads of the German, Swiss, and French bishops' conferences. Cardinal Reinhard Marx, president of the German bishops and one of nine cardinals advising the Pope on church and Vatican reform, gave the meeting's closing address.\n\nProfessor Manfred Spieker, a German church expert, wrote on the website Kathnet that the meeting was \"divisive\" and an abuse of the presidents' offices, given that only those bishops sympathetic to the homosexual agenda were invited. He criticized the event, stating it undermined the purpose and intent of the upcoming synod and promoted views that have \"schismatic potential.\"\n\nThe study-day took place just days after a referendum in Ireland to allow same-sex marriage, leading some to believe the timing was not coincidental. German Cardinal Walter Kasper, whose theology Pope Francis admires, told Corriere della Sera May 27 that the Irish vote means the church needs to address the question of same-sex couples more fully, and that what was a \"marginal topic\" at the last Synod on the Family in October 2014, has now become \"central.\"\n\nThe church, he said, has been too silent about this issue for too long and, in later comments, said the church needs to \"disarm\" its language to try to make contact with the secular world. The church, he believes, needs to honor long-lasting same-sex relationships.\n\nSuch sentiments are roundly rejected by faithful Catholics who view this kind of approach as surrendering to secular values and sowing confusion. However, the church homosexual lobby, driven by ideology more than the well-being of the souls of homosexuals themselves, is unlikely to be deterred.\n\nOne of the tools it is using to achieve its goal is the media. The major German publishing house, Herder, is to publish a large book in September\u2014just a month before the synod\u2014by a group of Catholic academics pushing the homosexual agenda. Called \"Who Am I to Judge?\" after the Pope's misquoted remark on the issue, it calls for more acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle on the grounds that condemning homosexuality no longer meets with a \"positive response\" among the faithful.\n\nAlthough Pope Francis has warned of a homosexual lobby in the church, it remains unclear how seriously he is in confronting it. A significant number of church leaders and academics and some of his closest advisers are pushing the agenda, but his silence and inaction in the face of such dissent is causing increasing distress among many faithful Catholics.\n\nChurch historian Roberto de Mattei observed that during the Irish referendum, the Pope kept a \"sepulchral silence\" and, despite its gravity, chose instead to often rail against other evils such as \"corruption, trafficking in arms and slaves, and the vanity of power and money.\" De Mattei and others feel that if the Pope, given his popularity, had strongly urged the Irish people to vote no a week or so before the ballot, it could have swung the result by as much as 10 percent, possibly enough to have led to a no vote.\n\nBy not doing so, they argue, not only was the Irish vote lost, but church divisions are being left to fester and deepen, driven by a wealthy and powerful German church that has all but lost its faith. Last week, church figures in Germany publicly rebuked Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Pope's deputy, for saying the Irish referendum result was a \"defeat for humanity.\" Meanwhile, media pressure is beginning to be exerted on those few German bishops who are resisting the homosexual lobby.\n\nArguably, a positive element to all of this is that the homosexual lobby is being exposed as they look to the synod for their salvation. However, the potential damage they will cause the church and souls in the meantime could be beyond measure.",
    " Title: \"Obama and Romney in Deadlock as Election Day Approaches\"\n\nArticle:\n\nWith five days remaining until the U.S. presidential election, both the Obama and Romney campaigns are making strong arguments for their respective electoral victories. According to top campaign advisers interviewed by The Wall Street Journal, President Obama's re-election strategy has been to disqualify Mitt Romney, often at the expense of making his own case. However, this strategy has not been successful in swaying voter favorability, as the latest polls show Romney and Obama tied on favorability, and both over 50 percent.\n\nThe Obama campaign's strategy has been to focus on the Rust Belt states, where a series of polls indicate that Romney may fall just short of an electoral victory. This has led to a narrative in the establishment press that Obama will be re-elected. On the other hand, Romney's advisers argue that close is good enough for the Republican nominee, pointing to high voter intensity on the Republican side and a strong performance with several key groups that were crucial to Obama's 2008 victory.\n\nThe Obama campaign's decision to move left after taking office and stay there has hardened Republican opposition and boosted a traditional turnout advantage for the Republican Party. The Obama Democrats argued that superior resources and a community organizing approach to governance and campaigning would allow Obama to overwhelm the organic advantage of the Republicans. However, early voting data suggests that this strategy has not been successful, as the early vote in swing states is erased or even reversed compared to 2008.\n\nIndependents are the most promising field of persuadable voters, and Romney is leading among this group by a wide margin. In the latest poll, Romney holds a 7-point lead among independent voters, with 16 percent still undecided or supporting a marginal candidate. It is highly unlikely that the incumbent will get half of these remaining undecided voters, giving Romney a clear advantage.\n\nChris Stirewalt, digital politics editor for Fox News, noted that the incumbent's \"Axelrod mustache promise\" has doubled voter intensity, with some voters indicating they will vote twice on Election Day. The race remains tight, and the outcome is uncertain, but Romney's lead among independent voters suggests that he may have the edge in a race that goes down to the wire.",
    " Title: McConnell Adopts Aggressive Strategy for Reelection Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) is gearing up for a robust reelection campaign, adopting a strategy reminiscent of recent efforts by Senate stalwarts such as Harry Reid and John McCain. The incumbent senator is reportedly using a combination of substantial fundraising, targeted voter messaging, and aggressive outreach to secure support from state GOP legislators.\n\nMcConnell's strategy appears to have already deterred at least one potential challenger, actress Ashley Judd, who announced on Wednesday that she would not seek the Democratic nomination. The senator's aggressive approach involves employing \"every penny\" of a war chest expected to surpass the $21 million he spent in 2008.\n\nThe Kentucky secretary of state, Alison Lundergan Grimes, is currently the most likely Democratic contender. If Grimes decides not to run, the Democratic party could be left without a top-tier candidate to challenge McConnell.\n\nIn the face of growing opposition from both the tea party movement and the Democratic party, McConnell is attempting to balance his political stance by appealing to both the Republican base and middle-of-the-road voters. He has expressed interest in supporting a gun control bill being drafted by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), but has stated his opposition to more sweeping gun-control measures.\n\nOn spending, McConnell has shifted his rhetoric from promoting earmarks as a sign of his influence in Washington, to criticizing President Barack Obama and Democratic budget plans as a means of appealing to the conservative base's concerns about the deficit and new spending.\n\nMcConnell has also been instrumental in drafting several bipartisan deals with the White House, including the year-end tax accord in 2010, the 2011 Budget Control Act, and the 2013 New Year's Day law to avert the fiscal cliff. The focus now shifts to the upcoming primary elections and the strategies each candidate will employ to secure their party's nomination.",
    " Title: White House Outlines Potential Consequences of Looming Spending Sequesters\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House has outlined some of the potential costs of looming spending \"sequesters,\" stating that the administration would cut 70,000 youngsters from Head Start, reduce federal loans to small businesses, and decrease the number of food safety inspectors on the job. The $85 billion in cuts, primarily in defense but also covering basic domestic spending, is expected to harm the economy, according to the White House.\n\nDavid Werfel, the federal controller for the White House's Office of Management and Budget, stated, \"Sequester is a blunt and indiscriminate instrument that poses a serious threat to our national security, domestic priorities, and the economy. It does not represent a responsible way to achieve deficit reduction.\"\n\nUnder the 2011 debt deal, the automatic cuts are scheduled to take effect every year for the rest of this decade, in exchange for Congress granting President Obama the authority to borrow more money. All of that borrowing space has been used up, but Mr. Obama wants to cancel the cuts and replace them with tax increases instead, arguing that the wealthy can afford to pay more in order to fund those priorities.\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner has stated that he wants to avoid the sequesters, and would prefer to cut spending in other areas, though they reject tax hikes, and any replacement must be alternative spending cuts. Defense-hawk Republicans say they cannot stomach the deep cuts to the Pentagon, which the White House now says would total 8 percent on an annualized basis.\n\nMany rank-and-file Republicans argue that the sequesters are the best deal the GOP can get at this point to actually see some spending cuts. This sentiment was bolstered after the \"fiscal cliff\" agreement, which saw Republicans agree to $650 billion in new taxes over the next decade without any corresponding spending cuts.\n\nThe White House has detailed a series of specific cuts from the sequesters that it says would be too devastating to allow to happen. These include:\n\n* 600,000 women and children would lose food stamps, which could also cost at least 1,600 state and local jobs due to reduced funding.\n* 100,000 formerly homeless people would lose their government-financed housing.\n* Cuts to special-education money would eliminate federal support for 7,200 school employees around the country.\n* Job safety inspectors might have to be furloughed, which the White House warned \"would leave workers unprotected and could lead to an increase in worker fatality and injury rates.\"\n\nThe White House also laid out the broader negative consequences the sequester would have when it comes to the economy as a whole. Private forecasters, the Congressional Budget Office, and others have estimated that letting the sequester take hold would cost the country millions of jobs.\n\nIf Congress cannot reach a deal, the White House urged lawmakers to delay the sequester by at least a three-month period to allow time to find targeted spending cuts, instead of an arbitrary across-the-board slash to all budgets, defense and domestic. Jason Furman, the principal deputy director of the White House's National Economic Council, said, \"The notion here is to delay these very severe impacts that I've described so that you have time to work out a deal that can delay and avoid them more permanently.\"",
    " Title: Senate May Reconsider Bipartisan Gun Background Checks Bill This Year\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 113th Congress continues its debate over gun control and background checks, with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hinting at a potential re-vote on the bipartisan bill this year. The renewed focus on the issue follows a mass shooting in Las Vegas that left five people dead, including the shooter, who was reportedly a felon and could not have purchased a gun with background checks.\n\nIn a statement to reporters on Tuesday, Reid argued that the failure of the Senate's bipartisan background check legislation last spring has not slowed the number of high-profile instances of gun violence. He stated that the Las Vegas shooter, who was a felon, would not have been able to purchase a gun if background checks were in place.\n\nWhen asked if the Senate would revisit the legislation from Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Reid replied that he would not be surprised if there was another vote on the bill. Manchin, who has been a vocal advocate for the legislation, stated that Reid's message is that if the Senate can secure five additional votes to break a 60-vote filibuster threshold, the legislation will be reintroduced.\n\nManchin, who is a gun owner and a supporter of the Second Amendment, emphasized that he supports responsible gun ownership and would not sell his gun to a stranger, criminal, or someone with a history of mental illness or irresponsible behavior.\n\nSenator John McCain of Arizona, one of the four Republicans who supported the Manchin-Toomey bill last year, stated that he would vote the same way if the bill comes up again this year and expressed no qualms with Reid calling for a re-vote.\n\nThe shooting in Las Vegas appears to have rekindled Reid's legislative focus on gun control for the remainder of the year, after months of inactivity. On Monday, Reid stated that the \"American people are counting\" on the Senate to pass the bill, and when the White House tweeted about passing gun legislation on Tuesday, Reid's account tweeted back, \"Very few things that I deal with really cause me the heartache that this issue does.\"",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Moves Toward Lawsuit Over President Obama's Immigration Executive Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner announced on Tuesday that he is moving closer toward suing President Obama over his executive actions on immigration. According to the National Journal, House Republicans are expected to vote on a resolution that would allow Congress to join the existing lawsuit that 26 states have filed against Obama, or file its own lawsuit against the president.\n\nThe lawsuit is anticipated to allege that the program President Obama announced last fall, which would grant protection from deportation to unauthorized immigrant parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, exceeds his legal authority. It is unclear whether the lawsuit will also claim that the president's existing \"deferred action\" program for young unauthorized immigrants, which has been in place since 2012, is illegal.\n\nThe difference between targeting both programs and just targeting the new set of executive actions is a matter of political and legal nuance. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which has granted protection from deportation to approximately 600,000 unauthorized immigrants, is a controversial topic due to the broader set of executive actions taken by President Obama in recent years.\n\nThe DACA program, which was not controversial when it was first announced, has become politically contentious as Obama considered and eventually implemented executive actions to provide relief to a broader group of unauthorized immigrants. The GOP did not sue Obama in 2012 or even in 2014 over the existing program.\n\nSuing Obama now over both programs could raise questions about why Congress is only taking legal action over something that has been ongoing for years if it truly believes it is a significant constitutional threat. This is relevant to the GOP's legal case and to the politics of the issue, as the DACA program was generally popular when it was rolled out. Polls show mixed opinions on the new executive action, with Americans either favoring letting Obama's actions stand by a margin of 15 percentage points or wanting it to be blocked by a similar margin.",
    " Title: Politicians Should Not Define Patriotism: A Call for Separation of Politics and Patriotism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe role of politicians in defining and directing patriotism has been a contentious issue, with some critics arguing that such self-aggrandizement is more reminiscent of cults of personality rather than American republicanism. The use of inauguration days to declare \"National Days of Renewal and Reconciliation\" or \"National Day of Patriotic Devotion\" has been criticized as a form of self-aggrandizement.\n\nThe article points out that treating politicians like quasi-religious figures and tying patriotism to political ideologies or office is not in line with the vision of the Founding Fathers. It is argued that if one's devotion to America is contingent upon the party or the person in office, it may not align with the original vision of American patriotism.\n\nThe article also criticizes the use of terms like \"economic patriotism\" or \"economic nationalism\" to replace American idealism. The author argues that these terms are used to justify policies that may infringe upon unalienable rights, such as avoiding excessive taxation, which is considered one of the most American things to do.\n\nThe article further criticizes economic nationalism, which is seen as a form of populism that lays blame on others for American problems and values power over principles, including liberty. The author argues that economic nationalism is not American patriotism, but rather a form of nationalism that is inseparable from the desire for power.\n\nThe article concludes by emphasizing that it is possible to hate one's president and still be patriotic. It is also possible to hope for a president's failure and still be patriotic. The author calls for a separation of politics and patriotism, arguing that presidents are politicians with agendas that may not always align with individual worldviews. The author suggests that devotional veneration of political ascendency every four years should be avoided.",
    " Title: Trump Tweets Doctored Video of Biden Amidst Ongoing Allegations of Inappropriate Behavior\n\nArticle:\n\nLess than two months ago, Alva Johnson, a former Trump campaign staffer, came forward to accuse Donald Trump of kissing her without her consent in 2016. This made Johnson the 16th woman to accuse the president of groping, kissing, or assaulting her. At least seven additional women have also accused Trump of sexual harassment.\n\nIn October 2016, Trump was infamously recorded bragging about groping women. When his remarks were published by the Washington Post, Trump issued a perfunctory apology and downplayed it as \"locker room talk,\" but the behavior he boasted about reflects the accounts of many of his accusers.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Trump tweeted out doctored footage of Joe Biden that was meant to mock the former vice president for a video he shared the day before. In the original video, Biden responded to accusations he repeatedly invaded women's personal space by promising \"to be much more mindful.\"\n\nIn the video Trump tweeted, Biden is shown grabbing himself on the shoulders and kissing himself on the head\u2014the same sort of inappropriately handsy behavior the former vice president is now reckoning with.\n\nTrump's decision to try to capitalize on accusations of inappropriate behavior despite all the allegations against him illustrates the sheer shamelessness of his administration. And it's not just the president. During a Fox News interview last Sunday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said video of Biden's \"creepy\" behavior would be \"a big problem\" for him if he ran for president, completely ignoring the fact that her boss has been accused of far worse.\n\nThe video Biden posted on Wednesday stops short of apologizing for his behavior, and his line that \"social norms are changing\" obfuscates the fact that at least two women\u2014Lucy Flores and Amy Lappos\u2014accused him of conduct they say was inappropriate at the time, not just in hindsight. If Biden decides to run in the first post-#MeToo presidential election, his treatment of women will rightfully be something he has to answer for.\n\nBut Trump is definitely not in a position to make a good faith case against him. So, if Trump isn't genuinely concerned about the treatment of women, what's the point of his tweet? One likely possibility: ending Biden's candidacy before it officially begins. The vice president continues to outpoll the Democratic presidential candidates who are already officially running, and he's currently outpolling Trump by anywhere between five and 13 points.\n\nThe news moves fast.

    " Title: Young Americans' Support for Socialism: A Closer Look at the Factors Influencing the Trend\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent shift in political ideology among young Americans has seen an increase in support for socialist ideas, as demonstrated by the election of a group of progressive congresswomen, commonly referred to as \"The Squad,\" and the growing popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist.\n\nIn a Harris poll, it was found that about half of millennials would prefer to live in a socialist country. This trend can be attributed to several factors, including economic hardships, such as the burden of student loan debt, and dissatisfaction with the political and economic status quo.\n\nOne significant factor contributing to this shift is the high level of student loan debt among college-educated Americans. Estimates suggest that they collectively owe an estimated $1.5 trillion in unpaid student loans. Many of these debtors struggle to repay their loans, and the prospect of debt cancellation is an appealing solution for those burdened with college loans.\n\nAnother factor is the impact of globalization on the American economy. Over the past 30 years, globalization has created wealth disparities, with the elite benefiting disproportionately, while many Americans have been left behind. Additionally, \"free\" but unfair trade agreements have contributed to the hollowing out of the American middle class.\n\nThe current generation of young people is also more urbanized and concentrated in coastal cities, where the cost of living is high, and opportunities for well-paying jobs are limited. This economic reality, combined with the allure of urban life, may contribute to a culture that emphasizes instant social justice and a desire for government intervention to address economic inequality.\n\nIt is worth noting that young people's support for socialism may not necessarily reflect a deep understanding of socialist ideologies or their historical consequences. Many young activists may be unaware of the bloody careers of historical figures such as Cambodian dictator Pol Pot, Soviet Union strongman Joseph Stalin, and Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, who each killed millions of their own people.\n\nFurthermore, the education system's focus on race, class, and gender indoctrination rather than the empirical study of economics, history, and politics may contribute to a lack of understanding of the historical and economic reasons for the wealth and stability of nations that have embraced free-market capitalism and constitutional government.\n\nIn conclusion, the shift in political ideology among young Americans can be attributed to several factors, including economic hardships, urbanization, and a lack of understanding of socialist ideologies and their historical consequences. It is essential for education systems to provide unbiased information about economics, history, and politics to ensure that young people make informed decisions about their political beliefs.",
    " Title: Trump's Response to Coronavirus Contrasts with His Border Policies and Nationalist Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak has been markedly different from his stance on border control and his emphasis on the importance of borders and the perceived danger of China. Despite the coronavirus originating from China and posing a foreign threat, Trump initially downplayed the severity of the virus, contradicting his long-held nationalist views.\n\nIn 2015, Trump famously called for a \"total and complete shutdown\" of Muslims entering the United States. However, in response to the coronavirus, Trump has largely adopted a more dismissive attitude, despite the risks of the disease still being unknown.\n\nTrump's more somber tone was evident in his Oval Office address, but many of his supporters have followed his initial attitude, dismissing the threat of the coronavirus. Arguments such as it being similar to the flu, only affecting the elderly, or that the swine flu had a higher death toll have been used to downplay the severity of the virus.\n\nThe coronavirus, originating from China, has posed a significant threat to the United States. It is China that has given the world the coronavirus, making it a more damaging issue than, for instance, the production of iPhones. Borders, the first line of defense, have been a key focus for Trump, with travel restrictions being implemented.\n\nThe spread of the virus has been facilitated by globalization and increased interconnectedness. The so-called Deep State, the federal bureaucracy, has been criticized for botching the initial testing in the United States. The New York Times reported on a Seattle-area research project that wanted to test for the coronavirus early, but was repeatedly denied by federal agencies due to senseless rules.\n\nGlobal supply chains have increased the vulnerability of the U.S. if the virus runs out of control, with China manufacturing a large share of medicines for the U.S., and other countries beginning to hold on to the masks and protective gear they produce.\n\nThe government will have to organize the U.S. response, not the free market, which is a key assumption of populist nationalists. Despite this, Trump supporters have resorted to denial rather than reacting to a threat that should be in their wheelhouse with tools congenial to them.\n\nThere are honorable exceptions, such as Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican, who has been warning of the coronavirus since the country was still preoccupied with impeachment. Tucker Carlson has also been vocal about the potential dangers from the beginning.\n\nBig events often carry a distinct ideological charge. The September 11 attacks had a strong conservative valence, while the financial crisis had a liberal one. The coronavirus outbreak, originating from China, poses a threat that should vindicate key assumptions of populist nationalists and spur them to action, but Trump and his supporters have been on a path toward allowing the coronavirus to discredit them.",
    " Title: Dayton Shooter Identified as Left-Wing Activist with Anti-Police, Pro-Gun Control Views\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday morning, Connor Betts, armed with a rifle, rampaged through a Dayton entertainment district, resulting in the deaths of his sister and eight other individuals, and leaving dozens more wounded. Police subsequently killed Betts.\n\nHeavy.com reports that they have identified Betts as the gunman through various means, including a matching tattoo, family connections, similar photos, and references to college and growing up in Ohio and Dayton.\n\nBetts' Twitter account, @iamthespookster, paints a picture of a left-wing anarchist and discontent, contrasting sharply with the anti-immigration manifesto of the El Paso gunman from the previous day.\n\nThe Twitter account reveals Betts' political leanings as far-left. He expressed support for the Democratic party, with a tweet reading \"Vote blue for gods sake,\" and a post on the day of Sen. John McCain's death stating \"F--k John McCain.\"\n\nDespite his fascination with guns, Betts was also a proponent of gun control, blaming the Republican party for school shootings. He tweeted, \"This is America: Guns on every corner, guns in every house, no freedom but that to kill,\" and, on the day of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, he tweeted at Sen. Rob Portman, \"Hey rob. How much did they pay you to look the other way? 17 kids are dead. If not now, when?\"\n\nIn reference to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, he tweeted, \"You can\u2019t kill 50+ people and injure 600 (! ) In 10 minutes with cigarettes my dude.\"\n\nPolitically, Betts was on the far left. His pinned Top Tweet was a retweet of someone else's claim that \"Millennials have a message for the Joe Biden generation: hurry up and die.\"\n\nWhen another Twitter user posted a picture of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and asked \"co-Presidents?\", Betts expressed disdain. He replied, \"Nahh, but only cuz Harris is a cop - Warren I\u2019d happily vote for.\"\n\nBetts also shared posts about \"concentration camps\" at the border and wrote, \"Cut the fences down. Slice ICE tires. Throw bolt cutters over the fences.\"\n\nAs of Sunday, Dayton police have stated they have no proof of Betts' motive.",

During the hearing, Hicks declined to answer several questions regarding her tenure in the White House.\n\nRepresentative David Cicilline (D-RI) expressed his dissatisfaction to NPR during a break in the hearing, stating, \"There's a whole bunch of lawyers in there.\" He added, \"She's staffed up with many lawyers \u2014 her own lawyers, White House counsel lawyers \u2014 all there to make sure that she follows White House directions to not share information, to prevent Congress from conducting its oversight.\"\n\nHicks was the first senior administration official to agree to testify before the House committee about Mueller and President Trump's orders. President Trump criticized Democratic officials in Congress for putting Hicks \"through hell\" months after the Mueller report had already concluded.\n\nIn a tweet on June 19, 2019, President Trump questioned why former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deleted and acid-washed her emails after receiving a subpoena from Congress, stating, \"Anybody else would be in jail for that.\"\n\nRepublicans, as reported by Fox News, criticized their Democratic colleagues for wasting taxpayer money and refusing to focus on issues like the immigration crisis. Representative Doug Collins (R-GA) said, \"The Democrats can try to re-litigate the Mueller investigation, but they don\u2019t have the resources, and they're simply just having dramatic readings.\" Collins added, \"This is not something we need to be doing when we have a border crisis, when we have other things going on... this is just another press release for the Democrats.\"\n\nHicks was originally subpoenaed by the committee, but after negotiations, she agreed to a closed-door testimony.

    " Title: Obama Faces Strategic Choice in Nominating Supreme Court Justice Replacement\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has pledged to fulfill his constitutional duty of nominating a successor for the late conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away over the weekend. The decision now lies with Obama on whether to attempt to sway Republican senators with his pick or make a political statement in the election year.\n\nSeveral Senate Republicans have already declared they will not confirm a new justice before the fall's presidential elections, given the potential impact on the court's balance of power. Mark Hurwitz, a political scientist at Western Michigan University, stated, \"I don't see the Republicans just giving in and giving President Obama the opportunity to do that.\"\n\nWith the Senate's Republican majority unlikely to confirm Obama's nominee before the elections, the president is left with a strategic choice: what he aims to achieve. Constitutionally, Obama cannot force the Senate to vote on his nominee, but he can apply public pressure through Republican inaction. Some Democrats hope that Republicans will at least allow a hearing, even if they block Obama's nominee.\n\nIf his nominee does not even receive a hearing, Obama can make a statement by choosing a lower court judge who has already undergone a rigorous vetting process or by reaching out with a politically acceptable candidate. One potential candidate is District of Columbia Circuit Court Judge Sri Srinavasan, who was confirmed by the Senate 97 to 0 in May 2013.\n\nRepublicans might not be inclined to cooperate, given their lingering resentment over Democrats' 2013 move to eliminate filibusters for lower court federal judges. With Obama having already made Democratic appointees the majority on nine of the nation's 13 circuit courts, Republicans are unlikely to concede easily on Scalia's replacement.\n\nThis could lead Obama to nominate an overtly liberal candidate, using the political fallout from the stymied nomination to mobilize voters in November. The political maneuvering underscores the significant consequences of the nomination, affecting issues such as campaign finance, affirmative action, religious freedom, and the Second Amendment.\n\nJay Wexler, a professor at the Boston University School of Law, noted that the nomination \"will likely have enormous consequences for constitutional law in the nation.\" Professor Hurwitz of Western Michigan University added, \"Republicans became very aware, particularly during the Reagan administration, how important judicial nominations were. With a presidential election looming, they smell the White House right now, and they don't want to lose this.\"",
    " Title: NBC News Aims for 50% Diversity in Workforce and Long-Form Investigative Focus on Communities of Color\n\nArticle:\n\nNBC News, a subsidiary of NBCUniversal News Group, has announced a new initiative, the \"Fifty Percent Challenge,\" with the goal of achieving a more diverse workforce. The initiative, as stated by NBCUniversal News Group Chairman Cesar Conde, aims to have 50% of the organization's employees be women and 50% be people of color.\n\nCurrently, women make up 50% of the organization's workforce, while people of color make up 27%. The company employs approximately 3,000 people, with news organizations including NBC News, MSNBC, and CNBC.\n\nIn an internal memo, Conde expressed the importance of reflecting the diversity of the country and the communities they serve. He stated, \"We want to increase diversity and inclusion both in front of and behind the camera, and earn the trust of every community in America that relies on us for exceptional journalism.\"\n\nThe chairman acknowledged that this objective is ambitious and will require time to achieve. He emphasized the need to start the effort now to reach the goal in the future. In addition to diversifying the workforce, the company will also focus on doing more long-form investigative pieces on issues that impact people of color.\n\nThe announcement comes amidst a wave of introspection and change within businesses and organizations across the country, following the Black Lives Matter protests and the death of George Floyd.\n\nIt is important to note that the memo does not specify that hiring decisions will be based solely on gender and skin color, but rather on achieving a more diverse workforce. The memo also does not indicate a shift away from journalism towards activism. The future impact of this initiative on the organization's journalistic approach remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Can a President Pardon Themselves? Giuliani and Legal Experts Debate the Constitutional Question\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's confidante and lead attorney in the ongoing Russian investigation, was asked about the possibility of a sitting president pardoning themselves. Giuliani stated that President Trump \"probably\" has the power to pardon themselves, but emphasized that Trump has no intention of doing so.\n\nGiuliani further explained, \"Pardoning other people is one thing. Pardoning yourself is another.\" He added that other presidents have pardoned individuals in similar circumstances, but noted the political ramifications of a self-pardon could be challenging.\n\nThe question of a president's self-pardoning power is a topic of debate among legal experts. P.S. Ruckman, a political science professor at Rock Valley College in Rockford, Illinois, who runs a blog about presidential pardons, told Bloomberg News, \"Literally, yes. He could write his pardon down on a napkin and sign it\u2014that would be a pardon.\"\n\nHowever, other legal experts argue that the answer is less clear-cut. Alan Dershowitz, Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, Emeritus, wrote in an op-ed that the answer is \"crystal clear\" but remains unknown due to the lack of a definitive answer. He noted that James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers that no person \"is allowed to be a judge in his own case.\" Dershowitz questioned whether a self-pardon would violate this principle and bestow jurisdiction on a court to invalidate the self-pardon.\n\nLaw professor Lawrence Tribe, in a Washington Post op-ed, cited the Office of Legal Counsel's reasoning four days before Richard Nixon resigned, stating that an embattled president cannot pardon themselves. President Trump has maintained his innocence in the Russian collusion \"witch hunt,\" and Mueller has not charged the president with any specific crimes, making the self-pardoning question a hypothetical one at this time.",
    " Title: Vice President Joe Biden's Possible Presidential Campaign: A Look at Recent Developments and Potential Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nSpeculation surrounding Vice President Joe Biden's potential entry into the 2016 presidential race has intensified following a series of meetings and public appearances in New York last week. According to John Heilemann of Bloomberg, Biden met with top Obama donor Robert Wolf, delivered a speech in support of a minimum wage hike, stood by Attorney General Loretta Lynch during an announcement regarding rape kit testing, and gave an emotional interview with Stephen Colbert.\n\nColumnist David Brooks of The New York Times has suggested that these events have rekindled the prospects of a Biden candidacy. Brooks believes that Biden's personal story of loss and empathy could resonate not only with Democratic voters but also with a broader electorate.\n\nRobert Wolf, a prolific fundraiser for President Barack Obama and a close friend of the Vice President, confirmed a meeting with Biden over the weekend. The topics discussed during their conversation reportedly included the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank and the nation's crumbling infrastructure, a focus of Wolf's consulting firm, 32 Advisors.\n\nIf Biden decides to run, securing the support of a prominent fundraiser like Wolf could provide several benefits. Wolf, who raised over half a million dollars for Obama in both 2008 and 2012, could serve as a significant source of campaign funds. Additionally, Wolf's connections to Wall Street, an area where Biden has few ties, could help establish economic credibility.\n\nHowever, Biden's potential campaign faces several challenges. He has previously run for president twice and lost both times, and his performance in New Hampshire has been lackluster. Moreover, Biden would miss the first Democratic debate and the Florida Democratic Party convention if he enters the race later.\n\nAnother significant challenge is Biden's need to compete with Hillary Clinton for the support of black voters, a demographic he would need to secure the Democratic nomination. Clinton currently enjoys a high approval rating among black voters in South Carolina, a state where Biden is reportedly focusing his efforts.\n\nThe question remains whether Biden has the \"emotional fuel\" to mount a successful campaign. While there appears to be enough support for a challenge, the outcome remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the Obama and Romney Campaign Ads: A Look at the Bain Capital Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing political campaign between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney has seen a series of negative advertisements from both sides, with fact-checkers rendering multiple verdicts on the subjects of Bain Capital, Romney, and outsourcing. This article will focus on the accuracy of the claims made in these ads.\n\nIn recent days, the Obama campaign has released a series of ads that have been criticized for their factual inaccuracies. These ads, according to the Chicago Tribune's David Brooks, are not just negative but also factually inaccurate. The Obama campaign has received numerous \"Pinocchios\" from fact-checkers for misleading, unfair, and untrue commercials based on \"no evidence.\"\n\nIn response, the Romney campaign has released a new ad, which, while not a bad offering, is said to only graze the critical point. The ad touches upon the factual inaccuracies in the Obama ads.\n\nThe Obama campaign's ads are not just relentlessly negative; they are knowingly and stubbornly factually inaccurate. For instance, in an interview with a Virginia television station WAVY, President Obama stated, \"Mr. Romney claims that he's Mr. Fix-it for the economy because of his business experience. And so I think voters entirely legitimately want to know, well what exactly was that business experience?\" This statement, according to fact-checkers, is misleading as the Obama campaign is trying to cherry-pick a few Bain Capital flops that occurred after Romney left and attribute them to him.\n\nThe issue of Romney's record at Bain Capital is not off-limits, but the Obama campaign is distorting Romney's record by selectively highlighting negative incidents that occurred after Romney left the company. This provides voters with false information and distorts Romney's record.\n\nIt is important to note that Romney should \"defend what happened at Bain Capital\" when he ran it. The Obama attacks make no such distinctions, leading to the poor reviews from fact-checkers.\n\nIn a report, CNN highlighted that four separate sources at Bain, including three Democrats, have confirmed what Romney has said, and what all the fact-checkers have found: Romney left Bain in February 1999, just like he's asserted for more than a decade. This information comes in addition to the taxpayer-funded inquiry into this exact subject that Massachusetts Democrats convened in 2002. That commission's conclusion? Romney left Bain in 1999.\n\nIn conclusion, the Obama campaign's ads are facing criticism for their factual inaccuracies regarding Mitt Romney's tenure at Bain Capital. The weight of evidence suggests that Romney did indeed end active management of Bain in 1999, as he has asserted for more than a decade. The Obama campaign's ads are distorting Romney's record by selectively highlighting negative incidents that occurred after Romney left the company.",
    " Title: U.S., World Powers, and Iran Nuclear Deal: Israel and Iran React Differently\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo days after the historic nuclear deal between the U.S., six world powers, and Iran, the focus has shifted to Washington, D.C., as both President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seek to persuade Congress to either accept or reject the agreement.\n\nPresident Obama stated, \"With this deal, we cut off every one of Iran's pathways to a nuclear program, a nuclear weapons program. Iran's nuclear program will be under severe limits for many years.\" In Israel, Netanyahu launched a U.S. media blitz against the agreement. He criticized the inspection regime, stating, \"I think the inspection regime is full of holes because instead of having instant inspections say within 24 hours, Iran has 24 days to open up suspect sites. Twenty-four days! Imagine giving a drug dealer 24 days' notice before you check the premises? This isn't going to work.\"\n\nIsraelis, who are on the front lines of the potential risk, are skeptical of the deal. According to a poll, 74% believe the deal will not prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. An Israeli man told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, \"It's a bad deal because sooner or later, it's going to reach us.\" An Israeli woman expressed her concerns, stating, \"The world doesn't realize that the Islamic people, they want to take over the world.\" An Israeli man also shared his doubts, saying, \"Iran is keeping saying that Israel and the States and Europe has to be destroyed and everything has to be Islamic. So, they're going to continue to doing everything.\"\n\nIn Tehran, the people celebrated the deal. However, Iranian-born Middle East expert Menashe Amir expects Iran will cheat on the agreement, which could open the doors for Iranian nuclear scientists. Amir told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, \"The fact that the Iranian scientists have the permission to continue their research means that Iran will continue to find better ways of enhancing its nuclear program. After six years or eight years, they will begin in a very fast way to make the bomb.\"\n\nAmir also anticipates this could lead to a Middle East nuclear arms race. He stated, \"We are talking today about a united Arab forces, which will include Saudis, Egyptians, and other countries, and they may make a united cooperation for making the nuclear bomb or having the protection of the Pakistanis who have the first Islamic bomb.\"\n\nBesides a nuclear arms race, some compare the $150 billion in sanctions relief to Iran, the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism, to a jihadist stimulus bill that will pour fuel on an already burning Middle East fire.",
    " Title: Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Changing Stance on FBI Director James Comey's Firing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who reportedly recommended the dismissal of former FBI Director James Comey, has publicly defended actions he now cites as reasons for replacing Comey. The memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein outlines the case for firing Comey, focusing on his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices during her tenure as Secretary of State.\n\nRosenstein criticizes Comey for holding a press conference on July 5, 2016, to explain why he was not recommending criminal charges against the Democratic presidential nominee. He also faults Comey for announcing, in a letter to members of Congress on October 28, 2016, the discovery of another email trove that might include evidence relevant to the Clinton investigation, just 11 days before the election.\n\nDespite these arguments, which Rosenstein presents as compelling, they are no stronger now than they were last July or last October, when Sessions, then an Alabama senator and a leading Trump supporter, publicly expressed support for Comey. In a Fox News interview, Sessions, a former U.S. attorney, described Comey as \"a skilled former prosecutor\" whom he had respected over the years.\n\nTwo days after Comey's press conference, Sessions appeared on Greta Van Susteren's Fox News show and expressed that the Clinton case was a difficult one. He suggested there was enough evidence for at least a misdemeanor charge against Clinton but admitted he had not studied the facts thoroughly. Sessions gave no hint that he disapproved of Comey's press conference, which, as Rosenstein notes, broke with the FBI's usual practice of leaving prosecution decisions to the Justice Department and avoiding the release of derogatory information about people who have been investigated but do not face charges.\n\nComey has argued that he needed to announce the outcome of the investigation because Attorney General Loretta Lynch had been compromised by her chumminess with the Clintons, as evidenced by a 20-minute conversation with Bill Clinton aboard her plane at a Phoenix airport on June 27, 2016. However, Rosenstein notes that Comey could have asked Lynch to recuse herself from the case and let another Justice Department official announce the outcome rather than taking on that task himself.\n\nSessions, in interviews last fall, endorsed Comey's defense of the press conference and his decision to follow up with his letter about newly discovered evidence shortly before the election. Now, Sessions says those actions are firing offenses. \"Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes,\" Rosenstein writes. However, it is unavailable whether these mistakes were considered as serious by Sessions when they were helping the Trump campaign.",
    " Title: Four GOP States Consider Cancelling 2020 Primaries to Support Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nFour Republican states, South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, and Kansas, are reportedly planning to cancel their 2020 primary contests, according to a report by Politico. Three sources familiar with the matter have confirmed this development.\n\nThe move is said to be an attempt by President Donald Trump to consolidate his control over the Republican Party at the state level. Trump is currently facing long-shot primary challenges from former Representative Joe Walsh (R-Ill.) and former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld.\n\nPolitico reached out to the state parties for comment, but no immediate response was available. In statements to Politico, state party officials in Kansas and Nevada suggested that the decision to cancel the primaries and caucuses was made to save costs and allocate the funds to other races.\n\nNevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald stated, \"It would be malpractice on my part to waste money on a caucus to come to the inevitable conclusion that President Trump will be getting all our delegates in Charlotte. We should be spending those funds to get all our candidates across the finish line instead.\"\n\nKansas GOP Chairman Michael Kuckelman stated in another statement that his party would have to spend an estimated $250,000 to hold their caucuses.\n\nIncumbent presidents' parties have canceled nominating processes in the past. The Arizona Democratic Party did not hold primaries in 2012 and 1996 when former Presidents Obama and Clinton, respectively, were running for reelection.\n\nSouth Carolina GOP Chairman Drew McKissick told Politico, \"As a general rule, when either party has an incumbent president in the White House, there\u2019s no rationale to hold a primary.\"",
    " Title: German Police Implement Ethnic Profiling to Reduce Crime Rates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an article published by Bloomberg, Leonid Bershidsky discusses the implementation of a new policing model in Germany, which involves a form of ethnic profiling. The model, which screens and detains North African men, was implemented following the 500 sexual assaults committed in Cologne on New Year's Eve in 2015.\n\nAccording to Bershidsky, the German police are using a form of ethnic profiling, specifically targeting Arabs, although they are technically classified as \"Caucasian.\" The police chief of Cologne, Juergen Mathies, stated that the 2015 New Year's Eve sexual attackers were not \"gray-haired older men or blonde, young women.\"\n\nThe article argues that the term \"racial profiling\" is often misunderstood and that everyone engages in some form of profiling. The author, Professor Walter Williams, defines profiling as \"a practice where people use an observable or known physical attribute as a proxy or estimator of some other unobservable or unknown attribute.\"\n\nThe article cites examples of profiling in medical and criminological science, such as doctors taking race, ethnicity, and sex into account when evaluating patients, and Israeli airport security scrutinizing Muslims more closely due to the near-exclusive nature of terrorism being an Islamic phenomenon.\n\nThe article also mentions that 83% of those stopped during the New York City's erstwhile stop-and-frisk program were black and Hispanic, and that 96% of all NYC's crime is committed by these groups. The article argues that this is not properly called racism but recognizing statistics.\n\nThe article also mentions examples of profiling by liberal figures, such as MSNBC profiling the San Bernardino terrorists as possible pro-lifers and Senator Sherrod Brown's assertion that \"white males\" are the biggest terrorist threat.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that \"racial profiling\" is a passion-stoking propaganda term and that there is only good profiling and bad profiling. Good profiling considers many factors, such as age, sex, dress, behavior, religion, and ethnicity, in accordance with sound criminological science. Bad profiling is governed by politics and puerile priorities. The article argues that fairness means that all groups overrepresented in a crime category should factor into a relevant profile.\n\nThe author, Selwyn Duke, is a conservative media personality whose work has been published on various conservative outlets.

    " Title: Senate Tax Reform Bill Differences with House Version and Potential Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Republicans are set to vote on their tax reform bill in the House today, following a speech by President Trump on Capitol Hill. However, passing the bill in the Senate may face challenges, as one Republican senator has already announced he will not vote for the bill as it currently stands.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) expressed optimism about reaching a consensus between the two chambers, stating that about 60-70 percent of the base policy has already been agreed upon. Tillis also noted that changes made based on feedback from the business community and economic modeling will further increase the level of commonality.\n\nOne key difference between the House and Senate plans is the Senate's call for a one-year delay in phasing in the reduction of the tax rate for businesses. This delay is to make the lower rate permanent under Senate rules. Despite the delay, Tillis asserts that businesses will still receive tax relief in the first year due to expensing and other benefits.\n\nTillis, who has experience in reducing corporate tax rates, believes that such reductions can significantly boost the economy. He cited North Carolina's transformation from one of the slowest-growing state economies to one of the fastest-growing after reducing the corporate tax rate.\n\nThe Senate bill also takes a step toward weakening the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) by repealing the individual mandate, a move supported by conservatives in both chambers.\n\nOn the House side, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy emphasized the pro-growth nature of the tax reform bill and its benefits for families and churches. The bill includes provisions for saving for future expenses for children and protecting churches from the Johnson Amendment, which forbids non-profit organizations, including churches and ministries, from supporting or opposing political candidates.\n\nSen. James Lankford is confident that the final bill in both chambers will include a repeal of the Johnson Amendment. He stated, \"We feel very good about protecting the free speech rights of every American regardless of their faith, for profit, nonprofit status, whatever it may be. We feel like this is going to be the opportunity to repair this.\"\n\nHowever, the massive tax overhaul could face difficulties, as Republican Sen. Ron Johnson has announced he will not support it. GOP senators can only afford two \"no\" votes for the bill to pass, but they remain optimistic that they will have a bill on the president's desk by the end of this year.",
    " Title: Biden Campaign Acknowledges Warren's Rise in Polls and Debating Skills, but Focuses on Own Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nJoe Biden's campaign team recognizes Warren's debating abilities and her rising popularity in polls, although they are not solely focusing on her, according to advisers and individuals close to the campaign. Biden has faced criticism during the first two debates, a reflection of his current lead in the polls and his campaign's preparation for further attacks from various candidates.\n\nAllies of Biden suggest that he has weathered rough debate performances in the past with minimal impact on his national poll numbers, demonstrating the enduring goodwill he enjoys from the Democratic base.\n\nThe campaign team sees several opportunities for Biden to differentiate himself. These opportunities include emphasizing his foreign policy credentials, given his tenure as Vice President and his previous role as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, amid foreign policy controversies involving the Trump administration.\n\nBiden's team believes the Democratic electorate is more moderate than some activists suggest, and they welcome debates on issues such as healthcare and social programs. Biden supports a public option but opposes eliminating private insurance, contrasting with Warren's \"Medicare for all\" proposal.\n\nAllies are eager to strengthen an argument Biden has been previewing: that it is not sufficient to have ambitious plans if those proposals cannot survive the political realities of Washington.\n\nSenator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, stated, \"Lots of other candidates have great plans, they have good policy papers, many of them have, you know, talked about them on college campuses or in the Senate. The difference, I think, is that Joe has decades of actual experience getting things enacted in a bitterly divided and partisan Washington, and I think he can and should point to that.\"\n\nWarren did not face significant scrutiny from leading contenders in the first two debates. Biden's allies privately hope that Warren will be questioned on the details and practicalities of her proposals by several candidates onstage, given her increased prominence in the race and the potential for attacks.\n\nWarren and Biden have previously clashed, engaging in a dispute over the nation's bankruptcy laws, which culminated in the passage of a bill in 2005 that Biden supported and Warren opposed.",
    " Title: California and Oregon to Allow Pharmacist-Prescribed Birth Control Pills Without Doctor's Prescription\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia and Oregon have become the first states in the nation to allow women to obtain birth control pills and other hormonal contraceptives directly from pharmacists without a doctor's prescription. California officials finalized regulations on a state law passed in 2013, while Oregon's governor, Kate Brown, signed a similar bill into law last week.\n\nThe new measures have been welcomed by women's health advocates, who argue that the move removes barriers to women's access to birth control and other reproductive health care. Kathy Kneer, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, stated, \"We support efforts like these that remove barriers to women gaining access to birth control and other reproductive health care.\"\n\nThe contraceptives will not be available over the counter like common items such as cough drops or antacids. In California, pharmacists can only dispense them after providing a health screening to women and taking their blood pressure. Oregon will also require a health screening, but the state's specific rules have not been developed yet.\n\nThe laws differ slightly. California's law has no age restrictions on patients, while minors in Oregon must show proof of prior birth control prescriptions from a physician. Oregon may also require pharmacists to undergo more training than the one-hour education required of California pharmacists, according to Marcus Watt, executive director of the Oregon State Board of Pharmacy.\n\nCalifornia's rules are expected to take effect after October 1, and Oregon's law after January 1. Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues associate at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank, said other states could follow California and Oregon's approaches, depending on how they work.\n\nThe laws were passed despite partisan debate in Congress over access to birth control. While members of both parties support legislation allowing over-the-counter access, Republican legislation would not require insurers to pay for it. Democrats argue that this would make hormonal contraceptives off-limits to many poor women, and they have introduced a bill that would require insurance coverage of over-the-counter hormonal contraceptives.\n\nCalifornia's regulations and Oregon's law do not address insurance coverage of birth control. However, California pharmacists have expressed concerns that insurers may not pay for the time spent screening women and dispensing birth control, as they would for a doctor's visit.\n\nPharmacists in California are preparing for the new regulations and hoping to resolve the reimbursement issue. The overall expansion of pharmacists' prescribing authority is aimed at relieving the burden on physicians faced with an influx of patients newly insured under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nKen Thai, part-owner and manager of the El Monte Pharmacy Group with 10 stores in Southern California, expressed excitement about the new regulations. \"Medical clinics in the area are overflowing, with long wait times. We're already doing other services like immunizations and cholesterol checks, and our customers already see us as a resource. We're ready for something like this. It's been a long time coming.\"\n\nUntil now, California pharmacists could only provide emergency contraception, also known as the \"morning-after pill,\" without a doctor's prescription. Most major pharmacy chains are expected to participate in offering non-prescription birth control, as they were involved in developing the protocols.\n\nSome patients welcomed the change, such as 26-year-old Anne Wong, who lives in San Francisco. \"I think it's really wonderful,\" she said. \"It's a drag to have to go to a clinic and talk to the doctor to get birth control pills \u2013 it takes a chunk out of your day.\"\n\nWong, who emigrated from Thailand at age 17 with her family, said the new access would help women in her community practice safer sex. \"The topic is still taboo,\" Wong said. \"But with the new regulations, 'I could just tell my parents I'm going to a store for something. All I'd need to do is just walk to the Walgreens near my house.'\"\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
    " Title: Trump Accuses China of Meddling in U.S. Midterm Elections, Denial from Chinese Foreign Minister\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from the traditional scripted format of a United Nations Security Council meeting, President Donald Trump accused China of meddling in the upcoming U.S. midterm elections during a meeting on weapons proliferation on Wednesday. Trump stated that China is attempting to interfere in the November elections to counter his administration's aggressive trade policies towards Beijing.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi later denied the U.S. accusation of election meddling during the same session. Wang said, \"We do not and will not interfere in any countries' domestic affairs.\"\n\nPresident Trump did not provide specific details about the alleged meddling, but later indicated that he was referring to China's retaliatory tariffs against U.S. farm products. Trump stated, \"You have statements made [by the Chinese] that they were going to hit our farmers, those are my voters.\"\n\nThe White House later confirmed that China is using a \"whole-of-government approach\" to interfere in the U.S. democratic system, including political, economic, commercial, military, and informational tools. The official stated, \"The activities have reached an unacceptable level.\"\n\nChina's tariffs have particularly affected U.S. farm exports, impacting states and districts that voted for Trump in the 2016 election. China also placed a four-page ad in the Des Moines Register last weekend, referring to the soybean dispute as \"the fruit of a president's folly.\"\n\nIn addition to the election meddling allegations, Trump used the meeting to level fresh threats against Iran, stating that new U.S. sanctions against Tehran will be in place within weeks, and that more penalties are being prepared to curb its military programs and support for anti-U.S. proxy groups.\n\nHowever, Trump's criticism of the 2015 nuclear deal found little support in Wednesday's sessions, as European leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May joined Chinese and Russian leaders in urging the deal's preservation. Iran was not represented at the morning session, but Iranian President Hassan Rouhani stated that the U.S. pressure campaign was failing and predicted that an isolated Washington would eventually rejoin the pact.\n\nTrump found virtually no support from the 15-nation Security Council to scrap the 2015 nuclear deal. Rouhani also stated, \"We do not wish to increase tensions.\"",

Liz Cheney Engage in Debate over Comparison of Immigration Detention Centers to Concentration Camps\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets and statements, Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) have engaged in a debate over Ocasio-Cortez's comparison of immigration detention centers along the southern border to concentration camps.\n\nOn Monday, Ocasio-Cortez, during an Instagram Live session, stated, \"That is exactly what they are: They are concentration camps.\" She further explained, \"I don't use those words lightly... I use that word because that is what an administration that creates concentration camps is.\"\n\nRepublicans, including Cheney, have criticized Ocasio-Cortez's comments, with Cheney stating on Tuesday, \"You demean their memory and disgrace yourself with comments like this.\"\n\nIn response, Ocasio-Cortez asked Cheney how she would describe the use of \"mass camps of people detained without a trial.\" Cheney suggested reading testimonies from Holocaust survivors and Elie Wiesel's memoir, \"Night.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth on Tuesday echoed a similar exchange in November, when Ocasio-Cortez cited past global refugee crises, including the Holocaust, to defend today's migrants seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) suggested that Ocasio-Cortez visit the Holocaust Museum in DC to better understand the differences between the Holocaust and the current situation at the border.\n\nNotably, the official Twitter account for the Auschwitz Memorial appeared to tweet a veiled line of support for Ocasio-Cortez, stating, \"Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it.\" The tweet did not directly mention Ocasio-Cortez but was in response to a tweet about the debate between the two representatives.",
    " Title: Unemployment Rate Drops to 7.7 Percent in November, According to BLS\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has reported a decrease in the unemployment rate from 7.9 percent to 7.7 percent in November. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 146,000. The employment increase was observed in retail trade, professional and business services, and healthcare sectors.\n\nDespite Hurricane Sandy making landfall on the Northeast coast on October 29th, causing severe damage in some states, the BLS stated that the storm did not have a significant impact on the new statistics. The BLS survey response rates in the affected states were within normal ranges, and their analysis suggests that Hurricane Sandy did not substantively impact the national employment and unemployment estimates for November. The regional and state estimates will be released on December 21st.\n\nAlthough the unemployment rate has decreased, the number of unemployed people has remained the same, indicating that more people may have stopped looking for work. The number of long-term unemployed people, those jobless for 27 weeks or more, also remains the same. Many people looking for full-time work are still working part-time jobs.\n\nIn November, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed at 4.8 million. These individuals accounted for 40.1 percent of the unemployed. The number of persons employed part-time for economic reasons, at 8.2 million in November, was little changed over the month. These individuals were working part-time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job.\n\nYesterday, Gallup reported their seasonally adjusted numbers for November, which put the unemployment rate at 8.3 percent and underemployment at 17.2 percent.",
    " Title: Report Reveals Release of Over 600 Criminal Immigrants by ICE in 2013\n\nArticle:\n\nA government watchdog report obtained by FoxNews.com has revealed that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released more than 600 immigrants with criminal convictions in early 2013, in advance of the \"sequester\" budget cuts. The report, by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, found that ICE indeed was trying to address the budget shortfall when leadership moved to sharply reduce the number of people in the detention centers.\n\nThe report, requested by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), found that ICE released 2,226 immigration detainees between February 9 and March 1, 2013. Of these, 629 had criminal convictions, some of whom had been implicated in serious offenses. The report indicated many should not have been released.\n\nThe report described an inconsistent and confusing scramble to make space in the detention centers. Local divisions did not have written guidance on how to \"prioritize\" the releases, and had \"limited access\" to legal advice since ICE leadership \"did not formally notify ICE attorneys\" of the plan. Only one local field office had an attorney on hand to review \"each case,\" according to the report.\n\nYet, the report noted that many of the illegal immigrants were required by law to be held. Adding to the confusion, ICE leaders did not tell local field offices to track the releases. When they started asking questions, officers had trouble providing the information. In the end, while the agency found officers made \"reasonable release decisions\" given the time frame, they ended up redetaining dozens of those they had released.\n\nIn a written statement, ICE said the reductions in 2013 were \"necessary\" due to the \"high levels of detention at the time, coupled with the looming prospect of sequestration.\" The agency said the assessments were made by \"career law enforcement officials on a case-by-case basis following a careful examination of each detainee's criminal and immigration history.\" The agency also stated that those released remained in removal proceedings and \"continue to be monitored.\"\n\nThe report comes as the agency, along with other federal departments, grapples with the surge of illegal immigrant children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The IG report did note the constraints ICE is facing. The agency is required by law to maintain an average daily population of 34,000 detainees, with funding coming from Congress and other sources. However, at the time, the report said, ICE was dealing with an average population of more than 35,000 detainees, facing budget cuts and other fiscal restraints, the agency decided to reduce the number of prisoners.",
    " Title: U.S. Voters Shift Toward Far-Right and Far-Left Candidates in Trade-Exposed Districts\n\nArticle:\n\nA new research paper by four leading academic economists suggests that U.S. voters are experiencing an \"ideological realignment\" in congressional districts most affected by competition from Chinese imports. As factories close, jobs disappear, and local economies struggle, Americans are favoring either conservative Republicans or liberal Democrats over more centrist candidates.\n\nThe researchers, including David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, cross-referenced voting records from the 2002 and 2010 congressional elections with district-by-district patterns of job losses and other economic trends over the same period. In trade-exposed districts already held by Republicans, voters were \"substantially more likely\" to elect a conservative Republican, according to the research paper. Conversely, trade-exposed districts with Democratic leaders were more likely to elect either a liberal Democrat or a conservative Republican.\n\nIn 2001, the year China joined the World Trade Organization, total U.S. manufacturing jobs averaged 16.4 million positions, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics seasonally adjusted data. By 2010, manufacturing jobs fell by nearly 30 percent to 11.5 million positions as competition with China intensified and the 2008 global financial crisis continued to weaken consumer and industrial demand. U.S. manufacturing has since recovered slightly to 12.3 million jobs in 2015, but many towns across the United States remain economically depressed, with boarded-up storefronts, abandoned factories, and shrinking populations.\n\nThe researchers attribute this shift in voting patterns to the economic disruption caused by increased competition from China. Voters in these areas are reaching out for candidates who promise to create jobs and stimulate economic growth, they said.\n\n\"Exposure to import competition is bad for centrists,\" Gordon Hanson, a professor at the University of California, San Diego and one of the authors, told the New York Times. David Dorn of the University of Zurich and Kaveh Majlesi of Lund University in Sweden also co-authored the research paper.\n\nThe divide has become particularly prominent among unionized workers, who are increasingly inclined to support candidates like Donald Trump and his anti-trade rhetoric, according to a report by \u2588\u2588\u2588 last month. Some Democrats and labor officials have expressed concern that Trump could capture a significant segment of the union vote, which is historically a crucial part of the Democratic electoral coalition.\n\n\"Donald Trump is tapping into the very real and very understandable anger of working people,\" Richard Trumka, the head of the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor federation, said in a March speech.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker Faces Legal Scrutiny Amidst Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker, a potential Republican presidential candidate, is currently under investigation for allegedly illegally coordinating with conservative groups. The investigation, known as a John Doe probe, began in August of 2012 and is examining possible \"illegal campaign coordination between certain special interest groups and the Walker campaign.\"\n\nThe John Doe probe is similar to a grand jury investigation, but it is conducted under strict secrecy orders in front of a judge rather than a jury. The investigation has been a subject of controversy, with some, including the Wall Street Journal editorial page, casting it as an attack on free speech.\n\nIn a recent development, a legal civil war has broken out among targets of the John Doe probe, as a conservative group sought to block prosecutors from having settlement talks with Walker's campaign. This has raised concerns among Walker's allies, who view the investigation as a chance to dismantle Wisconsin's perceived \"pernicious regulatory machine\" that allegedly targets political speech.\n\nWalker's campaign spent $86,000 on legal fees in the second half of 2013, according to campaign filings. The investigation has its roots in an earlier one investigating Walker's previous tenure as Milwaukee County executive, during which three of Walker's close aides were indicted on felony embezzlement charges and charges were brought against a major campaign donor and one of his appointees.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has been vocal in its criticism of the investigation, with the editorial page describing it as a \"partisan witch hunt.\" However, a federal district judge recently rejected a motion to dismiss a federal civil-rights lawsuit against Wisconsin prosecutors who are investigating the political activities of conservative groups (but not liberals).\n\nThe investigation and the legal civil war have put Walker in a difficult position. He is reportedly spooked by the probe and would like to put it behind him to focus on his presidential campaign. However, his backers want him to fight the investigation to the fullest extent, potentially putting himself at risk, in order to make a political point.\n\nThe outcome of the investigation could have significant implications for Walker's presidential campaign and his political career. The investigation is ongoing, and it remains to be seen how Walker will navigate this legal challenge while pursuing his larger political ambitions.",
    " Title: Midterm Elections: Democrats and Republicans Differ in Senate Race Outlook\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, both the Democratic and Republican parties have expressed optimism about their chances in the upcoming Senate races. According to recent polls, Republican candidates are slightly ahead in top Senate races, raising hopes among Republicans of gaining six seats and full control of Congress.\n\nHowever, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) maintains that the Democrats' ground game, focus on economic issues, and quality of candidates will help them retain a Senate majority. Schumer stated on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the Democrats' on-the-ground efforts are so strong that they should \"add 2 to 3 points\" to their candidate's side in each race.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, argue that voter intensity is on their side. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) pointed to early voting in Iowa as evidence, stating that it's \"never happened before\" and that the polls show this will be a good year for Republicans.\n\nThe Republican strategy in the Senate races involves linking Democratic incumbents and challengers to President Obama, who polls poorly in key red states with seats in flux. Senator Joe Manchin III (D-WV) stated on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that these people have voted against the president on issues and that he has worked with them.\n\nBoth parties have expressed support for their respective leaders, with Schumer backing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and Portman supporting Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Despite some waffling among party colleagues, both leaders have expressed confidence in their ability to lead the Senate if their parties win a majority.\n\nSenator Harry Reid has been criticized for refusing to bring to the floor scores of bills passed by the Republican-led House, leading to perceptions of gridlock in Congress. Senator Rob Portman argued that the only way to get something done is by winning the majority, stating that Washington needs to \"get its act together and start passing stuff.\"\n\nThe support for Mitch McConnell contrasts with endorsements for his Democratic opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, in a pair of Kentucky's top newspapers. The Lexington Herald-Leader's editorial board was particularly critical, stating that McConnell \"has repeatedly hurt the country to advance his political strategy.\"\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell, a Senate veteran since 1985, can find solace in some of the latest polls, with figures from the CBS News/New York Times Upshot/YouGov Battleground Tracker showing him up by 6 percentage points.",
    " Title: The Impact of Right-Wing Media on Obama's Engagement with Ferguson Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing crisis in Ferguson, Missouri, has sparked a wave of commentary urging President Barack Obama to take a more active role in addressing the situation. However, much of this commentary overlooks the role of right-wing media in shaping the political landscape and Obama's engagement with race-related issues.\n\nThroughout his two terms, the right-wing media has consistently employed offensive and racially charged rhetoric towards Obama, often using it as a professional path for success. This rhetoric has not only corroded public debate but also created a heckler's veto, effectively silencing Obama on the topic of race.\n\nExamples of this can be seen in Obama's responses to high-profile race-related incidents, such as the arrest of Henry Louis Gates in 2009 and the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012. In both instances, conservative media responded with race-baiting and personal attacks, labeling Obama as a \"racist\" or \"Race Baiter in Chief.\"\n\nMoreover, Rush Limbaugh, the most-listened-to radio host in America, has bombarded Obama with racial invective throughout his presidency. Statements such as \"If Obama weren't black, he'd be a tour guide in Honolulu\" and \"Obama is more African in his roots than he is American\" are just a few examples of Limbaugh's rhetoric.\n\nGiven this history, it is understandable that Obama may hesitate to engage more forcefully with the Ferguson crisis, as doing so could invite a right-wing media backlash that could last for weeks. This backlash could make it difficult to focus on the pressing issue at hand, as has been the case in the past.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge the role of right-wing media in shaping the political discourse surrounding race in America. While it is understandable for pundits to yearn for open dialogue and rhetorical leadership from the White House, it is less helpful to ignore the unpleasant realities of partisan politics in the age of Obama. A national conversation about race includes all corners of society, but it is clear that the conservative flank of American politics does not want to have a discussion about race or racism. Instead, they have made it clear that they will attack the president if he tries to heal that wound.",
    " Title: U.S. Congress Cautions Obama on Syrian Intervention as Alleged Chemical Weapons Attack Investigated\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Obama administration considers a response to the reported use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, members of Congress have urged caution and are urging the president to seek authorization before taking military action.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-TN), the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that he believes the president will respond soon with military action, but suggested waiting until Congress returns next week to seek its authorization. Corker also suggested a \"surgical\" response that would not move the U.S. away from its current policy of supporting the Syrian opposition group taking the lead on the ground.\n\nNew York Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the alleged civilian attacks last week \"horrific\" and urged the U.S. to respond with its NATO allies. \"But we have to move, and we have to move now,\" Engel said.\n\nTheir comments come after almost a year of lawmakers pressing Obama to make good on his statement about Syria \"crossing a red line\" by using chemical weapons. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel suggested Friday that the Pentagon might move naval forces closer to Syria in preparation for a possible decision by Obama to order military strikes.\n\nHowever, U.S. defense officials have said the Navy has already sent a fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern Mediterranean Sea, with lawmakers suggesting the best strategy now might be using Cruise missiles fired from offshore.\n\nRhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, a member of the chamber's Armed Services Committee, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that the U.S. cannot let itself get into a situation in Syria \"where this becomes a springboard for a general military option.\"\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has made an assessment that chemical weapons were likely used based on the reported number of victims, reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, and witness accounts. The White House also thinks Assad and his forces originally denied United Nations investigators immediate access to the site of the reported attack to give the evidence time to degrade.\n\nThe international aid group Doctors Without Borders has tallied 355 deaths from the purported chemical weapons attack on Wednesday, with three hospitals it supports in the eastern Damascus region reporting receiving roughly 3,600 patients with \"neurotoxic symptoms\" over less than three hours. Syrian state media has accused rebels of using chemical arms against government troops in clashes Saturday near Damascus.",
    " Title: Trump's Reactions to Personal Challenges: A Look at His Behavior Towards the Media and Potential World Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent combative press conference held by Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has sparked discussions about how he might handle personal challenges from world leaders, should he become the U.S. president. The incident, which involved Trump's response to questions about his charitable donations to veterans, has raised concerns about his ability to maintain composure and handle criticism from foreign leaders.\n\nDuring the press conference, Trump lashed out at reporters, calling one from ABC a \"sleaze\" and complaining that the press was not giving him credit for his generosity. His anger was directed at a controversy that arose in late May when The Washington Post questioned the accuracy of his claims about donations to veterans' groups. The total donated was significantly less than the $6 million Trump had initially stated, and it appeared that Trump himself had not donated anything.\n\nIn response to the controversy, Trump provided a detailed breakdown of the donations, stating that his foundation had made many of them, including his own $1 million gift, on May 23, after the Post story was published. Trump continued to berate the media throughout the press conference.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about Trump's ability to handle personal challenges from world leaders, given his apparent anger and thin skin when faced with criticism from the U.S. media. Personal relationships are a significant part of geopolitics, and handling them is one of the most important aspects of the presidency.\n\nHistorically, blustery leaders like Trump have faced challenges from their foreign counterparts. For example, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev hectored new U.S. President John Kennedy in Vienna in 1961, and the rapport between Ronald Reagan and the final Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, helped ease the end of the Cold War.\n\nTrump's campaign spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, stated that Trump would not behave towards foreign leaders as he did towards U.S. reporters. Pierson argued that Trump would not talk to a roomful of colleagues that way \"because they are not treating him the way the media is doing today.\"\n\nHowever, foreign adversaries can be much rougher than the U.S. media, and Trump's problem with foreign leaders is not rooted in belligerence as much as in credulity, according to one critic. Trump seems easy to flatter, and this has been exploited by world leaders such as Vladimir Putin and North Korea's dictator Kim Jong-un.\n\nThe Clinton campaign is eager to portray Trump as an unstable entity, and this image fits with their contention that he is too risky to entrust with America's nuclear codes. Clinton has used this image to pivot away from questions about the propriety and legality of her use of a private e-mail server as secretary of State.\n\nAsked about the server in multiple television interviews, Clinton responded with the same line: \"I hope voters look at the full picture of everything I've done in my career and the full threat posed by a Donald Trump presidency.\"",
    " Title: Trump Explores National Emergency Declaration to Secure Border Wall Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the partial government shutdown enters its third week, the White House is exploring various options to secure funding for the construction of a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border, including the potential use of the president's emergency powers to bypass Congress altogether.\n\nPresident Donald Trump stated on Friday, \"We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly,\" and reiterated the sentiment on Sunday. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Trump had directed every single Cabinet secretary and the Office of Management and Budget to find legal funds that could be used for a border wall.\n\n\"Presidents have authority to defend the nation,\" Mulvaney said, adding that he was personally involved in the search for funds that could be redirected toward a border wall. The government shutdown is tied for the third-longest on record, with no end in sight.\n\nKim Lane Scheppele, a professor at Princeton University's Center for Human Values, stated that Trump can test whether he has the power to declare a national emergency for this purpose under the National Emergencies Act. The Act allows him to declare a state of emergency without approval from anyone else, but he must then stay within congressionally delegated emergency powers.\n\nThe 1976 National Emergencies Act was passed in the post-Watergate, post-Vietnam era to create more structured procedures for the president's use of emergency powers. Under the law, the president must cite the specific emergency powers he is activating under existing statutes. According to the Congressional Research Service, there are hundreds of \"provisions of federal law delegating to the executive extraordinary authority in time of national emergency.\"\n\nOne potential avenue for Trump to declare an \"immigration emergency\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act. An immigration emergency is defined as an \"influx of aliens which either is of such magnitude or exhibits such other characteristics that effective administration of the immigration laws of the United States is beyond the existing capabilities\" of immigration authorities \"in the affected area or areas.\"\n\nOther factors that determine if an immigration emergency exists include \"the likelihood of continued growth in the magnitude of the influx,\" an \"apparent connection between the influx and increases in criminal activity,\" high \"demands on law enforcement agencies,\" and \"other circumstances\" defined by the attorney general. Under the law, the attorney general or head of a local government must submit a request to the president describing the immigration emergency and what is needed to address it. The president then determines if an emergency exists and informs the House and Senate Judiciary committees.\n\nAn Immigration Emergency Fund exists for that purpose, but the law only approves $20 million annually for the fund, far short of the $5.6 billion Trump is seeking. Another option that could potentially secure a larger chunk of funding for a border barrier would be under laws regarding military spending, which say the secretary of defense can undertake construction projects during a national emergency without authorization. The law says those projects must be \"necessary to support such use of the armed forces.\"\n\nThe law also permits the Army's civil works program to build structures necessary for the national defense after the president declares an emergency. The secretary of defense may also reprogram money that had been set aside for military construction projects. A third statute allows for the construction of emergency projects if the secretary of defense determines it \"is vital to the national security or to the protection of health, safety, or the quality of the environment,\" but that authority is capped at $50 million a year.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called Trump's invocation of his emergency powers \"really threatening talk\" that \"he doesn't have the power to execute.\" \"If Harry Truman couldn't nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this president doesn't have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border,\" Schiff told CNN.\n\nHowever, another Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, said Trump did have the authority to declare the national emergency but would face legal challenges. \"There is a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency. It's been done a number of times,\" Smith told ABC's \"This Week\" host George Stephanopoulos. \"In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, where is the emergency? You have to establish that in order to do this.\"",
    " Title: House Republicans Criticize Obama Administration's Handling of Bergdahl Incident, Alleging Lack of Congressional Involvement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a classified briefing on Monday, top national security officials presented their case to House lawmakers regarding the Obama administration's decision to trade five Taliban detainees for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. The briefing followed the administration's first opportunity to justify the controversial trade.\n\nRepublican lawmakers emerged from the more than hour-long briefing expressing dissatisfaction, claiming they learned little new information about the incident that had not already been disclosed in the media. A significant point of contention was the administration's decision to inform approximately 80 to 90 executive branch officials in the Pentagon, White House, and intelligence agencies, but not members of Congress, beforehand.\n\nRep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) commented, \"It strikes me as unfortunate that they could have 80 to 90 people in the administration and not be able to trust a single Republican or Democrat in the House or the Senate.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has publicly stated that he was informed the day before the Bergdahl exchange, but administration officials now claim that was not the case. The conflicting public viewpoints are rare between the administration and its chief partner on Capitol Hill.\n\nFormer House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King (R-N.Y.) stated that the administration briefers offered few details on who specifically in the Obama administration knew about the swap beforehand but said the officials were in logistical roles. King added that the officials were likely from the State and Defense departments, the National Security Council, and the White House.\n\nRank-and-file Republicans were frustrated by what they see as more stonewalling by the Obama administration as the White House tries to navigate yet another controversy. \"They [administration officials] made abundantly clear from the stage that we received no classified information,\" said Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), a longtime critic of President Barack Obama who also serves on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nDuring the briefing, members were shown a \"proof of life\" video of Bergdahl from January, made by his Taliban captors to prove he was still alive. Bergdahl reportedly told American military officials that he was held in a cage in total darkness for weeks at a time, according to The New York Times.\n\nWhile expressing sympathy for Bergdahl and his family, Republican lawmakers criticized the swap as improper and possibly illegal, as Obama was supposed to consult with Congress 30 days before making such a move. Some administration officials have privately claimed that if word of the U.S.-Taliban talks leaked, Bergdahl's life would have been in jeopardy.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a major in the Air National Guard who has served in Afghanistan and Iraq, said that the briefers did not address questions about assurances that the Taliban detainees could not return to the battlefield.\n\nSome Democrats sought to defend the White House's handling of the Bergdahl incident, stating they understood why the administration wouldn't share information with Capitol Hill about such a sensitive matter.",
    " Title: Democrats' Chances of Senate Majority Dim as Election Day Approaches\n\nArticle:\n\nThe prospects of Democrats flipping the Senate and gaining a majority have diminished over the past month, with key races showing a shift towards the Republican Party. To win control of the Senate, Democrats would need a net gain of two seats. Currently, only one Republican-held seat, in Arizona, is considered a 50-50 bet for the party. Three other targets in Texas, Nevada, and Tennessee have moved towards the Republican Party following the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nJames Henson, a pollster with Strategic Research Associates LLC, stated, \"The short interval in which there seemed to be some kind of possibility that Democrats could rally in the Senate was probably ill-fated to begin with, and we see less suggestion of that as we get closer to Election Day.\"\n\nDemocrats' prospects are better in the House, where most analysts predict they will win at least the 23 seats needed to flip control. The key House races are playing out in less Republican-friendly territory compared to the Senate. In the Senate, more than two-thirds of the seats up for re-election are held by Democrats, including several seats in states that President Trump carried by at least 20 percentage points.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, expressed optimism about turnout but declined to make any predictions about winning a majority. \"I am optimistic that we are going to see a big turnout,\" Mr. Van Hollen said at a forum sponsored by The Washington Post. \"I am not going to make any predictions for this reason. It entirely depends on turnout.\"\n\nThe biggest hurdle to Democrats' hopes is North Dakota, where Sen. Heidi Heitkamp trails her Republican challenger, Rep. Kevin Cramer, by 16 points, according to a poll this week. In Texas, Rep. Beto O'Rourke has outperformed early expectations but trails Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in most polling, raising questions about how many more supporters he can find in the Republican-dominated state.\n\nIn Missouri, Sen. Claire McCaskill's re-election race against state Attorney General Josh Hawley is so close that she started running a radio ad in which a supporter assures listeners she is \"not one of those crazy Democrats.\" The race for the open seat in Arizona between Reps. Kyrsten Sinema and Martha McSally is still considered a toss-up.\n\nIn Nevada, the contest between Sen. Dean Heller and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Jacky Rosen, is also considered a toss-up, with the latest three polls this month showing the Republican with a lead. Early voting in Nevada could bode well for Ms. Rosen, but the chairman of the Clark County Republican Party, Carl Bunce, had a different take, stating, \"The current turnout indicates no blue wave of any kind unless Democrats turn out in higher numbers than Republicans on Election Day, which would be against precedent.\"\n\nPrognosticators also see the Tennessee contest between Rep. Marsha Blackburn and her Democratic challenger, former Gov. Phil Bredesen, as a toss-up, with the latest polls showing a close race. In Indiana, Sen. Joe Donnelly is in a tight race against Republican challenger Mike Braun. In Florida, Sen. Bill Nelson is in a close race against Republican challenger Rick Scott. In Montana, Sen. Jon Tester is in a tight race against Republican challenger Matt Rosendale.\n\nIn summary, the chances of Democrats flipping the Senate and gaining a majority have diminished over the past month, with key races showing a shift towards the Republican Party. The prospects are better for Democrats in the House, where most analysts predict they will win at least the 23 seats needed to flip control. The key Senate races are playing out in less Republican-friendly territory compared to the House, with several Democratic incumbents in tight races in Indiana, Florida, Missouri, and Montana. The race for the open seat in Arizona is still considered a toss-up, and the Nevada contest between Sen. Dean Heller and Rep. Jacky Rosen is also considered a toss-up. The race for the open seat in Tennessee is also considered a toss-up, with the latest polls showing a close race.",

In an email to supporters, Booker pledged to \"channel our common pain back into our common purpose.\"\n\nBooker, who previously served as the mayor of Newark, launched his campaign on the first day of February, which is designated as Black History Month. In a video accompanying his campaign announcement, Booker recounted the racial discrimination faced by his family and spoke about the power of civil rights movements.\n\n\"The history of our nation is defined by collective action; by interwoven destinies of slaves and abolitionists; of those born here and those who chose America as home; of those who took up arms to defend our country, and those who linked arms to challenge and change it,\" Booker said in the video.\n\nBooker, who was elected to the Senate in 2013, is the state's first black senator. He plans to travel to the first caucus state of Iowa the weekend of February 9, followed by early battleground states South Carolina and New Hampshire.\n\nLike some of the other Democratic contenders, Booker has said he will not accept campaign donations from corporate political action committees and lobbyists. He also opposes Super PACs supporting any candidacy.\n\nSince his arrival in the Senate, Booker has been widely viewed as a potential contender for president and was a finalist for Hillary Clinton's vice presidential nominee in 2016. Branding himself as a progressive, Booker has embraced a 'Green New Deal' and supports Medicare-for-All health insurance provisions, comprehensive immigration reform, and criminal justice reform efforts.\n\nHowever, Booker has faced criticism from left-wingers for strong ties to Wall Street firms and the pharmaceutical industry. A member of the Senate judiciary committee, Booker is known for his fiery questioning of nominees and administration officials in the age of Trump.\n\nOn Friday morning, Booker participated in call-in interviews with radio shows popular with African American and Latinx listeners. Later in the morning, he will go on television to be interviewed on the popular daytime chat show The View, which has a majority female viewership. His mother will be sitting in the studio audience.",
    " Title: U.S. Healthcare System: A Comparative Analysis and the Path Forward\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has a complex healthcare delivery system, with a mix of private and government-funded insurance plans. Approximately half of Americans receive their health insurance through their employer or their spouse's employer, while over 40% receive it from the government. The remaining portion is either uninsured or obtains health insurance through the private individual market. The ongoing political debate centers on the role the government should play in the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nThe U.S. spends significantly more per person on healthcare than other industrialized countries, with overall medical spending totaling $3.5 trillion or 18% of the national gross domestic product in 2020. This high spending has led to other countries being used as models for solving U.S. healthcare delivery system problems. However, it is important to consider that other countries are often smaller and have more homogeneous populations, and what may work for one society may not be applicable or acceptable in another.\n\nAccording to a Forbes survey, the U.S. accounts for 38% of life-saving and life-extending medical innovations, compared to an average of 15% in other countries. The U.S. also leads the world in the research and development of pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn all other industrialized countries, the demand for healthcare is greater than the money budgeted for it, leading to chronic shortages and strict rationing of healthcare. Rationing can take various forms, such as long wait times, denying elderly access to certain procedures, or prioritizing individuals with political influence.\n\nCanada has a single-payer, nationalized system that is fully funded by taxpayers. In 2018, wait times for specialty care averaged 20 weeks, with 250,000 citizens waiting more than six months for planned treatments within the National Health Service in the past year. Great Britain established a comprehensive government health-care system in 1948, providing every citizen with cradle-to-grave coverage. However, over the past year, about 10% of the population has waited more than six months for planned treatments within the National Health Service, and 36,000 people have waited nine months or more.\n\nSwitzerland has a comparatively large private healthcare sector, with patients responsible for 30% of their own healthcare costs. This has led to a degree of healthcare consumerism in Switzerland, and the country has been fairly successful in holding down costs. However, as officials increase the number of benefit mandates required in insurance plans, healthcare costs are rising.\n\nSingapore has a multi-tiered system with different levels of care depending on the patient's ability and willingness to pay more. This is similar to the system in the U.S. before the passage of Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nWhile universal health insurance coverage is a worthy goal, the critical point is using the best mechanism to allow the greatest number of Americans access to healthcare. Simply having health insurance does not guarantee timely access to healthcare. The American experience with the Veterans Administration hospital system, a comprehensive, government-controlled, single-payer healthcare program, reveals unacceptable wait times and inefficiencies.\n\nThe U.S. distinguishes itself from other countries by a broader use of free markets. The free market offers the best solution to provide the greatest access to healthcare and to control costs. Eliminating third-party payers, greater use of health savings accounts, price transparency, and health insurance reform would put patients, rather than the government, in charge of their own healthcare.\n\nDr. Stark, the Health Care Policy Analyst for Washington Policy Center, emphasizes the importance of allowing Americans to make their own healthcare decisions and use their own healthcare dollars. This would give Americans the best chance to access healthcare and exercise their right to do so.",
    " Title: Chris Christie's Bridge Scandal: Paul Begala Suggests Scandal Will Haunt Christie as Bully Narrative Persists\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent analysis, political commentator Paul Begala suggests that the ongoing George Washington Bridge scandal will likely continue to haunt New Jersey Governor Chris Christie due to its alignment with perceptions of him as a bully. Begala argues that Christie's attempt to distance himself from the bully label by declaring, \"I am not a bully,\" during a press conference was not convincing.\n\nThe scandal, which involves allegations that Christie's staff and appointees disrupted traffic on the world's busiest bridge as political punishment, presents a difficult choice for Christie, according to Begala. He describes this choice as being between being a \"crook\" or a \"schnook,\" with a schnook being a victim or a fool. Begala contends that Christie is not convincing in his portrayal of himself as a victim.\n\nBegala points out that the scandal fits the negative narrative that has been built around Christie, who is known for his bold and forceful leadership style. The positive narrative, which portrays Christie as a straight-talking, no-nonsense leader, is also present, but the negative narrative of a bully is just as powerful and true, according to Begala.\n\nThe legal and political processes surrounding the scandal are ongoing, with the Democratic majority leader of the State Senate, Loretta Weinberg, stating that she is waiting for the subpoena power to continue and for the whole story of who knew what and when to be revealed. This means that continuing subpoenas could lead to further revelations, and there may also be lawsuits from aggrieved commuters, putting individuals under oath.\n\nBegala also notes that the scandal's proximity to the media epicenter, the East Coast, has helped fuel Christie's celebrity but may also contribute to his downfall. The truth, according to Begala, is that there is not much Christie can do about the three dynamics that are working against him.\n\nIn conclusion, Begala suggests that the Chris Christie bridge-closing scandal is unlikely to go away anytime soon and will likely continue to haunt Christie due to its alignment with the negative narrative of him as a bully.",
    " Title: Congress Faces Impasse Over Homeland Security Funding and Immigration Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nCongress finds itself in a stalemate as lawmakers return to the Capitol without a clear resolution to the ongoing funding showdown for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The impasse persists despite a week-long reprieve following the passage of a last-minute funding extension that avoided a shutdown last weekend.\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner, in an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" stated that the cause of the impasse is President Obama's overreach, citing the 38 times Mr. Obama unilaterally changed the Affordable Care Act. However, the funding crisis for DHS stems from Mr. Obama's immigration-related actions.\n\nHouse Republicans faced internal dissent last week over their leadership's strategy, with Speaker Boehner acknowledging disagreements over tactics but asserting unity in the fight against Mr. Obama's immigration actions. Representative Jim Jordan, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, dismissed speculation about the GOP agreeing to Democrats' demands, stating, \"That's not going to happen.\"\n\nWith a new deadline approaching, House Republicans aim to pressure Senate Democrats into negotiations for a funding bill that includes anti-amnesty measures. However, Senate Democrats remain adamant about the passage of a \"clean\" bill, with Senator Dianne Feinstein stating, \"We want a clean bill. We have passed, taken votes on a clean bill.\"\n\nThe Senate will vote on Monday to allow a conference committee, which can be blocked by denying the 60 votes needed to consider forming the committee. Senate Democrats have repeatedly vowed not to go to conference to reconcile the House-passed bill with anti-amnesty measures and the Senate-passed bill without policy riders.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid has vowed not to engage in conference negotiations, and Senate Republicans have surrendered to demands for a clean bill to end a filibuster of the House-passed legislation. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested invoking the \"nuclear option\" to change the Senate's rules to stop filibusters, a tactic Senate Democrats used when they controlled the chamber.\n\nThe standoff between the two parties continues, with no clear resolution in sight, as both sides dig in their heels over the funding for DHS and the future of President Obama's immigration policies.",
    " Title: Congressional Republicans Return to Washington Amidst Town Hall Controversy and Agenda Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Republicans returned to Washington on Monday, following a week-long recess marked by contentious town hall meetings that dominated headlines. The return to the nation's capital, however, offers little respite, as members face a daunting to-do list and the looming impact of President Donald Trump's joint congressional address on Tuesday.\n\nSenators are set to continue the arduous task of confirming Trump's Cabinet nominees, with Democrats employing procedural tactics to slow progress. Nonetheless, Republicans are expected to confirm Wilbur Ross as Commerce Secretary, as well as move forward with the nominations of Ryan Zinke at the Interior Department, Ben Carson at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Rick Perry at the Energy Department.\n\nConservatives are also pushing for the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, a seven-year promise that now appears more precarious due to tense exchanges with constituents and internal GOP disagreements. The repeal effort requires 50 senators, with Vice President Mike Pence acting as a tie-breaker. However, this means Republicans can only afford to lose two lawmakers.\n\nLast week, Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski stated in an address to her state legislature that she would not support a plan that repeals Medicaid expansion under Obamacare nor defund Planned Parenthood as part of the repeal. This could pose a problem if the final version of Obamacare repeal resembles a leaked draft released last week.\n\nAlabama Republican Rep. Mo Brooks admitted last week in a local radio interview that the town hall meetings might halt the repeal effort. \"I'll tell you, Toni, there are in my opinion a significant number of congressmen who are being impacted by these kinds of protests and their spine is a little bit weak,\" Brooks said on \"The Morning Show with Toni & Gary\" on WBHP 800 Alabama radio. \"And I do not know if we're going to be able to repeal Obamacare now because these folks who support Obamacare are very active, they're putting pressure on congressmen, and there's not a counter-effort to steel the spine of some of these congressmen in toss-up districts around the country.\"\n\nThe town hall pressure took the form of organized chants of \"do your job\" or even \"ACA,\" as well as thoughtful but challenging questions from individual voters. One such constituent asked Tennessee Republican Rep. Diane Black a detailed policy question before citing her Christian faith as her reason for supporting Obamacare.\n\nAt a town hall in Kentucky, a woman confronted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about the high numbers of people on food stamps in Kentucky, the lack of coal jobs, and the lack of health insurance. \"If you can answer any of that, I'll sit down and shut up like Elizabeth Warren,\" the woman said, referencing McConnell's recent use of Senate procedure to stop the Massachusetts Democrat from speaking on the Senate floor.\n\nAfter a rocky start, Trump is expected to focus his joint congressional address on policy goals, including health care and tax and regulatory reforms, as well as increased military spending. However, even with a White House ally to enact their party's agenda, Trump has proven to be as much a hindrance as a help.\n\n\"In many respects, this administration is in disarray, and they've got a lot of work to do,\" Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain told an audience in Munich last week. Trump's tone and the content of his Tuesday night speech will ultimately set Republicans' agenda for the near future, and could dictate whether they will be forced to answer new concerns from constituents or focus on their own long-standing wish list.\n\nTrump's propensity to get distracted by personal grievances and his administration's sloppy rollout of its immigration executive order\u2014now stalled in the courts\u2014have put Hill Republicans on defense rather than offense. Additionally, right before the recess, senators were briefed by FBI Director James Comey on the ongoing investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, remain committed to playing defense on the Affordable Care Act and further investigating Trump's ties to Russia. In an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi argued that Trump's former campaign ally and now Attorney General Jeff Sessions needs to recuse himself from overseeing any investigation into Trump's campaign's ties to Russia. Pelosi also argued that Republicans \"don't have the votes\" to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act despite their rhetoric.\n\n\"They do not have a replacement. What they have put forth and outlined will cost more to consumers. It will cover fewer people. It will give tax breaks to the wealthiest people,\" Pelosi said on ABC.",
    " Title: White House, Clinton Campaign Address Affordable Care Act After Criticism from Former President Clinton\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing former President Bill Clinton's criticism of President Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA) as \"the craziest thing in the world,\" the Obama administration and the Clinton campaign have sought to clarify their stance on the healthcare legislation.\n\nIn a news briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest defended the ACA, acknowledging that there are areas for improvement. \"President Obama, with cooperation from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, there are some things that could be done to further strengthen the law,\" said Earnest. Hillary Clinton, if elected president, has vowed to pursue these improvements, with President Obama's support.\n\nClinton's criticism of the ACA was made at a rally in Flint, Michigan, on Monday, where he discussed rising insurance premiums under the ACA. \"You've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people are out there busting it sometimes 60 hours a week wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half,\" he said.\n\nAfter the rally, Clinton's aides and campaign walked back his comments, stating that he is a supporter of the ACA but wants to address lingering gaps in the insurance markets.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump seized on the opportunity at a rally in Arizona, thanking Clinton for being \"honest\" about Obamacare. When asked about Clinton's comments during the White House news briefing, Earnest said, \"It's not exactly clear to me what argument he was making, and so I'll let him and his team explain that.\"\n\nEarnest emphasized the benefits of the ACA, including expanded coverage, limited healthcare cost growth, and consumer protections. Angel Urena, Clinton's press secretary, acknowledged that improvement is needed and outlined Hillary Clinton's proposed measures to address these issues.\n\nHillary Clinton, who was stymied by Congress in the 1990s when attempting to create affordable healthcare, has stated that the current Republican-controlled Congress wants to repeal the ACA altogether, making it impossible for Obama to attempt changes in the law without willing partners on Capitol Hill. Clinton has pledged to \"fix what's broken and keep what works\" if elected.",
    " Title: Key Republican Figures Criticize Trump's Decision to Withdraw U.S. Troops from Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nPeter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America, and a professor of practice at Arizona State University, is completing a book about President Trump's national security team and policies. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nThe withdrawal of American forces from Syria has drawn criticism from three senior Republicans: Sen. Lindsey Graham, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. The U.S. has been accused by the Kurds of betrayal due to the decision to pull out approximately 1,000 troops from Syria.\n\nThe troops in Syria are not on a combat mission but are in an advisory role to prevent the return of ISIS and to provide leverage over events in Syria, a country supported by Russia and Iran. The U.S. withdrawal allows Turkey to carry out military operations against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led group that was instrumental in retaking Syria from ISIS. The SDF is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, which has a restive Kurdish minority.\n\nThe SDF have lost around 11,000 soldiers fighting ISIS, while the U.S. has had 17 soldiers killed in action in both Syria and Iraq over the past five years. The U.S. has previously withdrawn troops from Syria, which precipitated the resignation of then-Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, who saw the move as an abandonment of American allies on the battlefield.\n\nThe U.S. has a history of withdrawing troops from Muslim states, which can lead to the rise of jihadist terrorist groups. After the U.S. pulled out of Iraq, the group that later became ISIS first organized in Syria in 2011, before it invaded Iraq three years later and took over much of the country.\n\nTrump's policy shift on Syria has been criticized for giving America's enemies an early heads-up about U.S. military plans and for potentially allowing ISIS to return. During his presidential campaign, Trump had correctly critiqued the total American troop withdrawal from Iraq under Barack Obama in 2011 as helping pave the way for the rise of ISIS.\n\nThe announcement on Syria also underlines the collapse of any kind of deliberative national security process. Trump appears to make unilateral decisions surrounded by a cabinet of yes-men and acolytes because he has chased out advisers like Mattis, former National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and former Chief of Staff John Kelly, all of whom tended to push back against Trump's more ill-advised decisions.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Authorizes Subpoenas for Mueller Report and Associated Materials\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - The Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee has authorized its chairman, Jerrold Nadler, to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full report on Russia's role in the 2016 election and related evidence. The move brings the U.S. Congress closer to a potential legal confrontation with President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nThe committee voted 24-17, along party lines, to enable Nadler to subpoena the Justice Department for the unredacted Mueller report, all underlying evidence, and documents and testimony from five former Trump aides, including political strategist Steve Bannon. The committee also authorized subpoenas for former White House Counsel Donald McGahn, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson.\n\nAttorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee, issued a four-page summary of Mueller's main conclusions last month, stating that the special counsel did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election. Barr has pledged to release the nearly 400-page report by mid-April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence-gathering sources and methods.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee's focus on subpoenas to obtain the Mueller report stems from the belief that Barr would not comply with a Democratic demand to turn over the report unredacted by a Tuesday deadline. Democrats have expressed concern that Barr could use redactions to suppress evidence of potential misconduct by Trump and his campaign.\n\nNadler stated that he would work with Barr \"for a short period of time in the hope that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report and all the underlying materials.\" If that does not occur, Nadler added, the committee will issue subpoenas and potentially seek a court order to obtain the grand jury material.\n\nRepresentative Doug Collins, the committee's top Republican, criticized the Democrats' actions, stating, \"This is reckless... It's also confusing since the attorney general is doing exactly what he said he would be doing: making as much of the report public as possible under federal law and departmental policy.\"\n\nIn another development, the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee, led by Trump critic Adam Schiff, is reportedly seeking an interview with and documents from a top organizer on Trump's inaugural committee. The Wall Street Journal reported this development, citing people familiar with the request, but the report could not be immediately confirmed by the news organization.\n\nBarr's March 24 letter to lawmakers explaining Mueller's \"principal conclusions\" stated that the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice. Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller's inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump. Trump has denied collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice, while Moscow has denied election interference.\n\nDemocrats have pledged to fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to enforce a subpoena and obtain the full report. \"If the department still refuses, then it should be up to a judge - not the president or his political appointee - to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record,\" Nadler said.\n\nTrump ally Lindsey Graham, Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter that the House panel's demand for classified information and grand jury testimony was \"dangerous and ridiculous.\" The Justice Department declined comment, while Priebus, Bannon, McGahn, and their representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Justice Department regulations give the attorney general wide latitude on how much to release from special counsel inquiries. Nadler also stated that he would seek a judge's permission to get access to Mueller's grand jury material, which is protected under federal law.",
    " Title: Violent Protests Disrupt G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany\n\nArticle:\n\nThousands of anti-globalization protesters disrupted the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Hamburg, Germany on Friday, setting cars on fire and attempting to block leaders' delegations from entering the summit grounds. Authorities reinforced police presence from other cities, but requested additional support after the situation escalated.\n\nOn the second day of protests, dozens of police officers formed moving lines in various parts of the city and used water cannons to disperse protesters from city streets. At least 45 demonstrators were arrested, 15 were temporarily detained, and 160 police officers were injured, including three who were hospitalized.\n\nHamburg's fire department reported that 11 protesters were severely injured and transported to hospitals after falling from a wall during confrontations with police. The fire department also treated 26 people and took 14 of them to the hospital, but the reason for the protesters climbing the wall remains unclear.\n\nHamburg Police tweeted, \"Our fears have been confirmed. Several of my colleagues were injured in yesterday's riots by high velocity projectiles.\" The city's interior senator, Andy Grote, stated, \"We've asked for a few hundred more police officers - they're on the way.\" Grote described the potential for violence as \"shocking.\"\n\nGerman police reported that all leaders entered the city's convention center safely. The leaders, including German host Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and many others, were meeting to discuss issues such as international terrorism and climate change.\n\nGermany's Justice Minister Heiko Maas told reporters that the violent protests were a disservice to the overwhelmingly peaceful demonstrators. \"Every peaceful protest is welcome,\" Maas said. \"But that is no free pass for unrestrained rampage.\"\n\nThe violence began on Thursday and continued into Friday, with demonstrators breaking windows at the Mongolian consulate and puncturing the tires of a car belonging to the Canadian delegation. Police estimated there were 100,000 people in total at the demonstration on Thursday, with 12,000 participating in the central march. Organizers called off the event once violence broke out.\n\nPolice also reported that one of their helicopters almost collided with a rocket flare, and a pilot of a different helicopter suffered eye injuries after a laser was pointed at them.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump arrived in Hamburg on Thursday following his speech in Warsaw, where he called for defending Western values and rallying against \"dire threats\" to civilizations. \"Just as Poland can not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken,\" Trump said during his speech in Poland. \"Our values will prevail, our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.\"\n\nTrump and Merkel met privately after his arrival on Thursday, discussing issues that include North Korea, the situation in the Middle East, the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and \"some issues on the G20 agenda.\" U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel also participated, according to a German government statement. Trump then had dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\nOn Friday, Trump is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin for about 35 minutes. Trump tweeted early Friday that he is looking forward to his meeting with the Russian president.",
    " Title: Republican Advantage in Senate Elections Shifts in 2016, According to Political Analyst Charlie Cook\n\n Article:\n\n Political analyst Charlie Cook, in a report for the National Journal, asserts that the Republican advantage in the Senate elections observed in 2014 is not expected to persist in the 2016 election cycle. The Senate seats that the Republicans won in 2014 were favorable due to seven Democratic senators hailing from states that former presidential candidate Mitt Romney won handily in 2012, an unpopular president to run against, and fewer seats that the Republicans needed to defend.\n\n In contrast, Republicans will have to defend 24 seats in 2016, while Democrats will only have 10. All 10 Democratic Senate seats are in states that President Barack Obama won in 2012, and seven states that are currently held by Republicans. These states include Florida, Illinois, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\n A silver lining for the Republicans is that the Senate seats up for re-election in blue states were not won by Obama by margins as wide as the red states won by Romney, where Democrats were up for re-election in 2014. The reddest state with a Democratic senator up for re-election in 2014 was West Virginia, which Romney won by 27 points in 2012. By contrast, the bluest state up for re-election with a Republican senator is Illinois, which Obama won by 17 points.\n\n Another silver lining for the GOP is that not all states with Republican senators up for re-election that were won by Obama in 2012 are necessarily competitive. For example, it is very unlikely that Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley will lose in Iowa, even though the president won the Hawkeye State by 6 points in 2012. The competitiveness of the other states will depend on who the Democratic challengers are.\n\n Democrats and Republicans may break even on open seats up for re-election, with the Democrats having three open seats, two in deep blue states, while the Republicans have two open seats, with only one considered competitive. If Democrats want to reclaim the majority in the Senate, they will need to pick up four seats if a Democrat wins the presidential election, and five if they do not.",
    " Title: National Poll Shows Warren and Biden in Close Race for Democratic Presidential Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nA new national poll on the eve of the fourth-round Democratic presidential primary debate indicates a close race between Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden for their party's nomination.\n\nAccording to a Quinnipiac University survey on Monday, Warren stands at 30 percent support among Democratic voters and independents who lean toward the party. Biden, who was the unrivaled front-runner until Warren's surge in the polls over the past couple of months, is at 27 percent. Warren's three-percentage-point advantage is within the survey's margin of error.\n\nThe poll is the third conducted by Quinnipiac since late last month showing Warren with a slight edge over Biden. \"For Senator Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,\" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy emphasized. \"Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stands at 11 percent, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4 percent. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, and billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each registered at 2 percent in the poll. The other candidates in the shrinking but still large field of contenders stood at 1 percent or less.\n\nQuinnipiac's survey differs from a Fox News poll released last week that indicated Biden at 32 percent, with Warren ten points back at 22 percent and Sanders at 17 percent. No other candidate cracked double digits in the Fox News survey.\n\nTwelve candidates have qualified for Tuesday's debate, which is set to be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. They are, in alphabetical order, Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Harris, Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, Sanders, Steyer, Warren, and Yang.\n\nWhile national primary horserace polls have garnered significant attention, the battle for the nomination is a fight for the states and their delegates. A new poll in New Hampshire, the state holding the first presidential primary, indicated a three-way tie at the top.\n\nWarren stands at 25 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State in a Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, with Biden at 24 percent and Sanders at 22 percent. Buttigieg stands at 9 percent, and Harris at 5 percent, with no one else in the field topping 2 percent.\n\nIn New Hampshire's Republican presidential contest, President Trump remains the overwhelming favorite against three extreme long-shot primary challengers, but his support has deteriorated from 88 percent a month ago to 71 percent in the survey. One of the primary challengers, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, saw his support jump from 3 percent in early September to 14 percent in the new survey.\n\nThe Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University poll was conducted Oct. 9-13, with 422 likely Democratic primary voters and 405 likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey's margin of error was plus or minus 4.8 percentage points for Democratic primary questions and plus or minus 4.9 percentage points for GOP primary questions.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 11-13, with 1,195 self-identified registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The survey included 505 Democratic voters and independent voters leaning Democratic with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points.",
    " Title: GOP and Democrats Clash Over ObamaCare Repeal and Replacement Strategy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe battle for the future of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as ObamaCare, intensified on Capitol Hill this week as President Obama and Vice President-elect Mike Pence met with their respective congressional allies to discuss strategy for the Republican's repeal push.\n\nWhile President Obama urged Democrats to \"fight\" for the Affordable Care Act's survival, Pence assured Republicans that the Donald Trump administration will make the law's demise its \"first order of business.\"\n\n\"It was a promise made on the campaign trail,\" Pence said at a press conference after meeting with House Republicans. \"The first order of business is to repeal and replace ObamaCare... People voted for a better health care system, and we owe them that.\"\n\nPence sought to reassure supporters jittery about reports that party leaders could delay repeal efforts and that they have no replacement plan. He also said the repeal process would be a \"two-track approach,\" with incoming GOP President Donald Trump using his executive powers, as leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress draft and pass the requisite legislation.\n\n\"It will be a legislative and executive action agenda to assure an orderly transition to something better,\" said Pence, who with Trump takes office on Jan. 20. He also said the incoming White House team is \"already working on a series of executive actions.\"\n\nSources also told media outlets on Wednesday that Pence said in the meeting that Republicans hope to have a repeal bill on Trump's desk by Feb. 20, one month after the inauguration.\n\nThough Pence boasted Wednesday that Trump could start taking executive action with minutes or hours of being sworn in, he and House Republican leaders were peppered with questions about when the repeal process would be complete and why they don't have an alternative health care plan.\n\n\"We have plenty of plans,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \"We don't want to pull the rug out on people. We do not want people to be caught with nothing.\"\n\nEnding ObamaCare without a substitute plan could result in as many as 20 million Americans losing their health insurance, which would be a political disaster for Republicans.\n\nObama exited his 90-minute, closed-door meeting without comment but reportedly urged fellow Democrats not to \"rescue\" Republicans on what he suggested be called \"Trumpcare.\"\n\nNew Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said afterward that Obama and fellow Democrats had a \"very inspiring\" meeting in which they discussed a strategy to save ObamaCare, then blasted Republicans for their repeal-replace agenda.\n\n\"It would make America sick again, lead to chaos instead of affordable care,\" the New York Democrat said. \"They have no idea what to put in place of [ObamaCare]. They talked about repeal, but for five years they have nothing to put in its place.\"\n\nThe visits come on the second day of the new, GOP-led Congress. Trump replacing Obama at the White House in 16 days puts the GOP's longtime goal of annulling much of the 2010 health care overhaul within reach.\n\nTrump, despite his campaign vows to repeal the law, warned his colleagues on Wednesday not to let Democrats off the hook for a program he called a \"disaster,\" while warning them to be careful in their methods.\n\nThose who voted for Trump and other ObamaCare detractors are already concerned about congressional Republican leaders saying after the election that they'll need two to four years to implement a replacement plan.\n\nObamaCare was created as a way to drive down overall insurance costs by reducing emergency-care visits and other uninsured medical expenses. However, lower-than-projected enrollment among younger, healthy Americans as well as doctors and insurance companies dropping out of the program have contributed to significantly increasing premium costs.\n\nOn Tuesday, as the 115th Congress opened, Senate Republicans took the first step toward repealing ObamaCare. Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., introduced a resolution that begins the process for repeal legislation and calls for two House and two Senate committees to send over a legislative plan by Jan. 27.\n\n\"Today, we take the first steps to repair the nation's broken health care system,\" said Enzi, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He and other leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress are relying on a parliamentary maneuver known as \"budget reconciliation\" to dismantle the law because it avoids a Senate Democrat filibuster and requires only a 51-vote majority for passage in the chamber, not the 60-vote majority.\n\nRepublicans have a 52-to-48 member majority in the Senate and a 241-to-194 majority in the House, which requires only a simple majority for passage. Trump has provided few specifics about how he would revamp the nation's $3 trillion-a-year health care system. Steps he and congressional Republicans have mentioned include greater reliance on tax credits to help people afford coverage. And he has talked about keeping such provisions as allowing young adults to stay on their parents' plan and providing access to coverage for Americans with pre-existing medical conditions.",
    " Title: House of Representatives Investigates Potential Lies by President Trump in Mueller Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nThe House of Representatives is currently investigating whether President Donald Trump may have lied to special counsel Robert Mueller during the Russia probe. In a court hearing on Monday, a House lawyer, representing the House Judiciary Committee, requested files from the special counsel's inquiry, with a focus on the president's statements to Mr. Mueller regarding WikiLeaks.\n\nThe primary focus of the Democratic-led inquiry is on alleged abuse of power by Mr. Trump in US-Ukraine relations. However, the impeachment inquiry is also reportedly scrutinizing the president's statements to Mr. Mueller during the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nDoug Letter, representing the House Judiciary Committee, spoke to the federal appeals court on Monday, revealing that the impeachment inquiry is also investigating whether Mr. Trump lied to Mr. Mueller during the course of the probe. Mr. Letter has requested the redacted parts of the Mueller report and the full transcripts related to those portions.\n\nDuring Mr. Mueller's testimony before Congress in July, he was asked whether Mr. Trump's incomplete written responses showed he was not always telling the truth. Mr. Mueller replied, \"I would say, generally.\" It is unclear what exactly Mr. Mueller meant by his response, but Mr. Letter told the court on Monday he believed it meant the president \"had been untruthful in some of his answers.\"\n\nUS media report that Mr. Letter may have been referring to whether Mr. Trump lied about contacts with WikiLeaks and knowledge that they were going to publish hacked Democratic emails. Mr. Letter added that evidence from the recent trial of Trump adviser Roger Stone strengthened lawmakers' argument for obtaining the secret material.\n\nStone, who was convicted last week of lying to Congress about his work with WikiLeaks, had several calls with Mr. Trump during the 2016 election. The president has said he did not know of any contact between his campaign and WikiLeaks and that he did not discuss WikiLeaks with Stone.\n\nA lawyer for the Department of Justice argued that the impeachment inquiry was not a judicial proceeding and thus it was not legal for lawmakers to view classified grand jury material. However, during the impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon, a federal judge granted the House access to grand jury materials.\n\nFollowing Monday's oral arguments, the appeals panel is considering the matter. Ahead of the news of this additional thread in the inquiry, Mr. Trump tweeted that he would \"strongly consider\" testifying to the impeachment inquiry \"in order to get Congress focused again.\" As he did with the Mueller report, the president has dismissed the impeachment probe as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThis week, eight individuals are due to testify before House lawmakers as a part of the impeachment proceedings. On Tuesday, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the National Security Council who listened in on Mr. Trump's July call with Ukraine's President Zelensky, will testify. The July call sparked a whistleblower complaint that eventually led to the start of the impeachment inquiry.",
    " Title: Biden Consolidates Lead in Democratic Race as Super Tuesday Sequel Yields Comfortable Wins\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a continuation of the primary season, six states held Democratic nomination contests on Tuesday, collectively known as the \"Super Tuesday Sequel.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden emerged as the clear winner, taking Mississippi, Missouri, and Michigan. The results from Washington, Idaho, and North Dakota are still pending, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders will hope to perform better in those states.\n\nThe race appears to be firmly in Biden's control, as he has consolidated his lead following his strong performance. In Michigan, a state that gave Sanders a surprise win in 2016, Biden's victory could mark the beginning of the end for Sanders' campaign.\n\nExit polls indicate that the difference in Michigan was white voters, union voters, and college graduates. Sanders won all three groups in 2016, but on Tuesday, Biden captured these demographics. He carried college graduates 51-44, whites 51-45, and union members, who made up 30% of the primary electorate, 54-42.\n\nBiden's strong performance among black voters, late-deciders, and those looking for a candidate who can beat Donald Trump contributed to his comfortable win. The ease of the result has raised questions about whether the 2016 Michigan primary was a reflection of Hillary Clinton's weakness rather than Sanders' strength.\n\nIn Mississippi, more than 60% of the electorate on primary night was black, according to exit polls. Biden dominated that demographic, winning 86-11. The state's results are significant because they mean Biden will win the lion's share of Mississippi's 36 delegates to the national convention, further extending his delegate lead.\n\nBernie Sanders performed best with the youth vote, ages 17 to 29, according to exit polls. He carried it 82-15 in Michigan and 76-19 in Missouri, but only lost it by 4% in Mississippi, despite being routed in the state. The problem for Sanders was that the age group averaged only 12.5% of the electorate in those three states, not nearly enough to save the day for Sanders.\n\nWhile this may be good news in the short term for Biden, it is a flashing warning sign for the general election if he is the nominee. Young voters were a key part of the coalition that delivered the White House to Barack Obama in 2008, as he won them by a record 34% over John McCain. If Biden does not find some way to improve his standing with this age demographic, he may suffer the same fate as Hillary Clinton, who only won the youth vote by 18%.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Biden made his pitch to Sanders' voters, perhaps with the autumn campaign in mind. \"I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,\" he said. \"We share a common goal, and together we'll defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe epitaph for Sanders' campaign may be that it was premised, in part, on the passion of new young voters who simply did not show up in sufficient numbers at the polling booths. As the primary season continues, the race for the Democratic nomination narrows for Sanders, and the path to victory becomes increasingly improbable.",
    " Title: Migration Trend: Americans Shift from High-Tax States to Low-Tax States\n\nArticle:\n\nOver the past decade, approximately 3.5 million Americans have relocated from high-tax states, such as California and those in the Northeast, to low-tax states like Texas and Arizona. This trend is expected to accelerate, according to a report from the American Legislative Exchange Council co-authored by Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore.\n\nThe Republican Party's tax bill, which caps the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), could reportedly speed up this migration. Laffer and Moore estimate that California and New York will lose around 800,000 residents over the next three years, nearly double the number from the previous three years. Connecticut, New Jersey, and Minnesota combined are projected to lose approximately 500,000 people in the same period.\n\nThe authors of the report suggest that as the migration increases, it will boost real-estate values in low-tax states while hurting high-tax states. In states with high income taxes, such as California, New York, Minnesota, and New Jersey, people can currently deduct their state income taxes on their federal return, but the SALT cap will limit this deduction to $10,000 per family.\n\nWhile 90% of taxpayers are unaffected by the change, high earners in high-tax states will reportedly bear more costs of their state government under the new SALT cap, according to Laffer and Moore. In states like New York, the elimination of full SALT deductibility is expected to cost the state $14.3 billion, according to a report by Fox. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has referred to the tax bill as an \"economic missile.\"\n\nIn contrast, nine states, including Florida, Nevada, Texas, and Washington, impose no tax on earned income. Since 2007, low-tax states like Texas and Florida have gained 1.4 million and 850,000 residents, respectively, from elsewhere in the U.S., according to Laffer and Moore. High-tax states like California and New York combined have lost more than 2.2 million residents during the same period.\n\nLast week, Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott invited residents of high-tax New Jersey to move to Texas, citing his administration's $4 billion tax cut, as reported by \u2588\u2588\u2588. Abbott's invitation followed New Jersey's newly sworn-in Democratic Governor Phil Murphy's budget proposal, which requested a $2.7 billion increase from the prior year's budget, according to the report.",
    " Title: Christ Church Removes Memorial Plaques of George Washington and Robert E. Lee\n\nArticle:\n\nChrist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, has announced the removal of memorial plaques dedicated to its former vestryman and the country's first president, George Washington, and Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The decision was made due to the plaques causing discomfort and perceived unwelcoming atmosphere for some visitors.\n\nIn a letter to the congregation, church leaders stated that the plaques, which have been on display since 1870, are relics of another era and do not align with the church's motto, \"All are welcome\u2014no exceptions.\" The plaques, located on either side of the altar, will be removed by next summer, with a new location yet to be determined.\n\nThe decision has sparked a heated response, with supporters praising the church for its \"courageous\" stand, while critics have compared the church's leadership to extremist groups such as the Taliban or the Islamic State. The church's Facebook page has become a battleground for the debate.\n\nThe plaques, about the size of grave markers, read \"In memory of George Washington\" and \"In memory of Robert Edward Lee.\" The Washington plaque was bought by the first president when the church opened in 1773, and he was a vestryman and contributor throughout his life. Lee attended Christ Church from age 3, and his daughter, Mary Custis Lee, left the church $10,000 in her will upon her death in 1918, which was used to establish the church's endowment.\n\nThe church leaders stated that the lack of information or comment on the two men's lives in the church was part of the problem, as the sanctuary is a worship space, not a museum. The church has small metal markers on the Washington family pew and at the location where Lee was confirmed, but there is no additional context provided.\n\nThe church's website promotes itself as \"a church where George Washington worshipped\" and displays a picture of its famous patron. It is unclear whether the church could divorce itself from Washington entirely, as the website and Washington's historical connection to the church are significant.\n\nIn recent years, monuments dedicated to Lee have been under scrutiny, with incidents of violence in Charlottesville this year surrounding a Lee statue that the city is trying to remove. In response, a church Lee attended in Lexington, Virginia, changed its name from R.E. Lee Memorial Church to Grace Episcopal Church. The Washington National Cathedral also removed a stained-glass window with an image of Lee.\n\nChrist Church, however, stated that the two men were inextricably linked in history and had to be considered together, as they were erected together and visually balance each other. In their letter to parishioners, the church's leadership praised Washington as \"the visionary who not only refused to be king but also gave up power after eight years, and a symbol of our democracy.\" Lee was described in less-glowing terms, as a longtime parishioner who for some \"symbolizes the attempt to overthrow the Union and to preserve slavery.\"\n\nThe leaders wrote, \"Today our country is trying once again to come to grips with the history of slavery and the subsequent disenfranchisement of people of color.\" Despite his generosity to Christ Church, Washington was a more regular attendant at Pohick Church, which stands south of Mount Vernon. A staffer at Pohick said they have no plans to delete Washington from their church.",
    " Title: Obama Adjusts Economic Turnaround Timeline Amidst Approaching Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shift from his 2009 statement that a failure to right the economy in three years would mean a \"one-term proposition,\" President Barack Obama has seemingly moved the goalposts for economic recovery. During a campaign trail appearance in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the President stated, \"Now, we knew from the beginning that our work would take more than one year, or even one term -- because let's face it, the middle class was getting hammered long before the financial crisis hit.\"\n\nThis potential adjustment in the President's timetable for economic recovery comes a day before the Labor Department is set to release the October jobs report. Last month's survey showed a decrease in the jobless rate, providing seemingly good news for the economy and Obama's re-election campaign. However, some economists have questioned the accuracy of the statistic, and the report being released on Friday is the last major economic survey before Election Day.\n\nPresident Obama has consistently argued that he needs more time to complete the work he started. In an August 2011 fundraiser, he said, \"When I said change we can believe in, I did not say change we can believe in tomorrow.\"\n\nHowever, the claim that \"we knew from the beginning\" it would take more than one term is a departure from what Obama told NBC's Matt Lauer in February 2009. At the time, Obama stated, \"A year from now, I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress, but there's still going to be some pain out there. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition.\"\n\nRomney's campaign spokesman, Ryan Williams, responded to Obama's Green Bay remarks, stating, \"Four years ago, President Obama made a series of commitments to the nation and said that he did not deserve a second term if he failed to keep them. Now, faced with a record of broken promises and failed policies, the President is trying to reissue and repackage the same pledges and mislead Americans into believing that the results will somehow be different.\"\n\nThursday marked the first day since Super Storm Sandy that both candidates were out on the trail in full force. They bickered over who can claim the mantle of the \"change\" candidate. Romney's campaign asserts that the former Massachusetts governor is the only one offering \"real change.\" Obama, on the other hand, argues that his opponent is merely offering to return America to the policies of the George W. Bush administration, policies that he claims unfairly favor the wealthy.\n\nThe President was campaigning Thursday in Wisconsin, Nevada, and Colorado, while Romney made a three-stop swing through Virginia. Romney's campaign also revealed Thursday that it is planning a rally in Pennsylvania, a state that has backed Democrats in recent presidential races. All four states are important battlegrounds.",
    " Title: UN Arms Trade Treaty: Assessing the Impact on Second Amendment Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) faced challenges during the month-long conference held in New York City in July, but as noted by Ted Bromund of the Heritage Foundation, the concept of the ATT is not easily discarded. The treaty's proponents, including numerous countries and left-wing nongovernmental organizations, are pushing for its implementation.\n\nOne question that has arisen is whether the UN's argument that the ATT will not infringe on Second Amendment rights is honest. Katie, in a recent post, posed this question, and it deserves further scrutiny.\n\nThe Obama administration has stated that they will not accept any treaty that infringes on the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens to bear arms. Given President Obama's stance on gun control and his feelings about the right to bear arms, the ATT has become a significant issue.\n\nContrary to the common belief that a two-thirds majority in the Senate is necessary for UN treaties to take effect, this understanding is too simplistic, as noted by Ted Bromund in a separate article. If the ATT conference produces a treaty that is open for signature, President Obama may sign it immediately. The U.S. will then be under a legal obligation not to defeat the ATT's \"object and purpose.\" The interpretation of this phrase will rest with the State Department's lawyers, whose decisions can not be predicted and are not easily subject to legislative oversight.\n\nFurthermore, Americans should be cautious about the UN's claims that the ATT will not infringe on their Second Amendment rights. A report by the UN Coordinating Action on Small Arms titled \"The Impact of Poorly Regulated Arms Transfers on the Work of the UN\" recognizes that states have a right to \"individual or collective self-defense\" and that the ATT does not aim to impede or interfere with the lawful ownership and use of weapons. However, it also states that because of the problem of diversion, or the transfer of weapons to the illicit market, the arms trade must be regulated in ways that would minimize the risk of misuse of legally owned weapons.\n\nThe Obama administration has also echoed claims that the ATT will not pose a threat to domestic gun owners. However, a Washington Times editorial sees through this assertion, stating that the agreement's language is broad, vague, and poorly defined, and could be stretched in ways that would pose a threat to the Second Amendment.\n\nIn conclusion, the ATT will not prevent violence, terrorism, and intra-state conflicts, as its backers contend. The logistics alone are impossible, and the fact that the Obama administration is agreeing to come together as equals with dictatorial regimes like Iran is unconscionable.\n\nGiven the Obama administration's record on honesty and transparency, Americans should approach the administration's assurances about the ATT with skepticism. The soaring gun sales in Obama's first term and the subsequent skyrocketing gun stocks since his reelection may tell you everything you need to know about whether Americans take the administration at their word.",
    " Title: San Francisco Police Department Instructed Officers Not to Use Body-Worn Cameras During Journalist's Home Raid\n\nArticle:\n\nA San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) memo obtained by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press reveals that police were instructed not to use body-worn cameras during a high-profile raid of journalist Bryan Carmody's home last year.\n\nIn the two-paragraph memo, Lieutenant Pilar Torres states that officers conducting the raid were told not to utilize their department-issued body-worn cameras (BWC) for the operation, as the video footage could compromise the confidential investigation.\n\nKatie Townsend, legal director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, commented, \"Body-worn cameras are designed to increase police transparency and accountability. The fact that officers were instructed not to use their bodycams during an illegal raid of a journalist's home is deeply troubling.\"\n\nIn an email response to Reporters Committee questions, SFPD spokesman Sgt. Michael Andraychak said the department is not able to provide additional information about the memo \"due to pending administrative investigations.\"\n\nThe SFPD raided Carmody's home with search warrants and a sledgehammer on May 10, 2019, about a month after the freelance journalist refused to reveal the source of a leaked police report concerning the death of Jeff Adachi, a longtime San Francisco public defender. Officers seized computers, cameras, and phones from Carmody's home before conducting a separate search of the journalist's office.\n\nAll of the search warrants were later deemed illegal under California's \"shield law,\" which protects journalists' confidential sources and materials. In March, San Francisco agreed to pay Carmody $369,000 to settle a claim filed by the journalist.\n\nThe incident sparked nationwide outrage, especially among journalists and press freedom advocates. The unexplained presence of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at the search, and the fact that agents questioned Carmody about his source, amplified the press freedom concerns in the case.\n\nLast May, the Reporters Committee called for an investigation into the raid. The Reporters Committee and a coalition of 60 media organizations then urged a California court to return Carmody's seized materials. The Reporters Committee, First Amendment Coalition, and Northern California Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists also sued to unseal Carmody's arrest and search warrant records.\n\nThe Reporters Committee has also pursued records related to the FBI's presence during the raid. According to an FBI document obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit the Reporters Committee filed in September, FBI agents knew Carmody was a journalist when they questioned him. It is unclear whether the FBI followed Justice Department guidelines requiring authorization from the attorney general before questioning a member of the news media.\n\nThe Reporters Committee regularly files friend-of-the-court briefs and its attorneys represent journalists and news organizations pro bono in court cases that involve First Amendment freedoms, the newsgathering rights of journalists, and access to public information.

    " Title: Conservative Figures Allegedly Harassed and Attacked by Antifa in Philadelphia\n\nArticle:\n\nOn August 6, 2018, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and Communications Director Candace Owens claimed they were harassed and attacked by Antifa during a breakfast outing in a Philadelphia cafe. According to their Twitter posts, the incident occurred shortly after their arrival, with Antifa members reportedly surrounding the establishment and using bullhorns.\n\nKirk and Owens alleged that they were met with hissing, chanting, and screaming upon leaving the cafe. Kirk also stated that he was doused with water, and the police had to intervene for safety reasons.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Owens and Kirk shared their experiences, accusing Antifa of violence and labeling them as an \"all-white fascist organization.\" They also claimed that the police force protecting them was all-black and Hispanic.\n\nBoth Kirk and Owens appeared on Hannity, a Fox News program, to discuss the incident on August 6, 2018. In subsequent tweets, Kirk and Owens expressed their views on the incident, criticizing Antifa and suggesting a connection between the incident and a call for confrontation made by Representative Maxine Waters.\n\nIt is important to note that the characterization of Antifa as an \"all-white\" organization is not universally accepted, as the group is known for its anti-fascist and anti-racist ideology. Additionally, the allegations made by Kirk and Owens have not been independently verified, and the specific details of the police force's ethnicity are not publicly available.\n\nThis incident is a part of a broader debate surrounding free speech, political violence, and the role of public figures in inciting confrontations. The Turning Point USA and Antifa have been involved in several similar incidents in the past, further fueling the ongoing discourse.",
    " Title: Obama Nominates Jeh Johnson as Homeland Security Secretary\n\n Article:\n\n President Barack Obama has announced his intention to nominate Jeh Johnson, former Pentagon attorney, as the next Secretary of Homeland Security. The nomination will be made official at a ceremony on Friday. If confirmed by the Senate, Johnson will replace Janet Napolitano, who left the administration to head the University of California education system.\n\n Johnson served as the general counsel for the Department of Defense during Obama's first term. During his tenure, he provided legal review and approval for every military operation approved by the President and the Secretary of Defense.\n\n The nominee is described as a critical member of the President's counterterrorism team and someone who worked closely with Homeland Security officials during his years at the Pentagon. His specialties include cybersecurity, and he played a key role in repealing the Pentagon's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy that banned openly gay servicemembers.\n\n Johnson also provided legal guidance in the use of unmanned drones against terrorism suspects overseas and in the use of military commissions instead of civilian courts to try suspects. He led a crackdown on unauthorized news leaks at the Defense Department.\n\n During a speech at Britain's Oxford University last year, Johnson expressed the view that the nation's war on terrorism should not be endless, and the focus should shift to law enforcement and intelligence operations.\n\n Johnson's nomination could face scrutiny during a Senate confirmation hearing, with potential topics including his role in national security, human rights, and the use of military commissions and drones.\n\n Elisa Massimino, president of Human Rights First, praised Johnson for grappling with the challenges of protecting national security while respecting human rights and upholding American ideals during his time at the Pentagon.\n\n However, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) criticized Obama for nominating a \"loyalist and fundraiser\" to lead what he called a \"mismanaged\" department. Sessions expressed concern that the department needs a proven manager with strong relevant law enforcement experience, recognized independence and integrity.\n\n Johnson, a native of Wappingers Falls, N.Y., also served as general counsel to the Air Force during President Clinton's administration.",
    " Title: Budget Battles: A Historical Perspective on the Recurring Fiscal Conflicts in the U.S. Congress\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Congress and the presidency have been embroiled in a series of recurring budget battles, with each new resolution over taxes and spending leading to another round of fighting. The latest fiscal cliff, as some call it, has once again brought the nation's budget process into the spotlight, with the federal government potentially shutting down or failing to raise the debt ceiling in the coming weeks.\n\nOne of the main drivers of these budget battles is partisan strategy, as polarization has made almost every issue more contentious on Capitol Hill. In recent years, Republicans have taken the initiative to use the budget as a means to handcuff Democratic presidents.\n\nThe strategy has deep roots, dating back to the 1960s when conservative Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans focused attention on the rising deficits to force President Lyndon Johnson to accept deep spending cuts. In 1995 and 1996, Republicans shut down the federal government with their push for spending cuts, a tactic they continued to employ throughout President Bill Clinton's term.\n\nSince 2010, a growing number of Republicans have been willing to use aggressive techniques to force President Barack Obama's hand on this issue. They have demonstrated a willingness to shut down the government and threaten not to raise the debt ceiling, which would send the country into default.\n\nWhile there have been moments when Democrats have challenged Republican presidents, the difference is that they have usually done so symbolically to make a statement about Republican policies, whereas the new generation of Republicans appears willing to follow through on the threat.\n\nAnother reason the budgeting process is becoming ever more brutal is because, historically, once legislators break the barrier of using a certain tactic, the practice can become normalized. The best example is the filibuster, which has become a routine weapon in partisan combat since the 1970s.\n\nThe budget wars are also fueled by the 24-hour news media, which is constantly in search of dramatic stories to win attention. The budget war offers great fodder, with the possibility of a fiscal cliff providing political junkies a bit of the kind of thrill that \"Breaking Bad\" fans have felt every time Walter White extricates himself from another bind.\n\nAt some point, there will be pressure to reform the process. The latest round of budget battles has led a larger number of Republicans, like Sen. John McCain, to be openly critical of their colleagues and call for a very different approach. As Rep. Peter King, an opponent of the Affordable Care Act, explained, \"I still think we should try to repeal the bill. But you repeal it the same way you passed it. You get bills through both houses of Congress, and you get the president to sign it.\"\n\nBudget reform is possible, and there have been several moments in U.S. history when Congress overhauled the entire budget process. It might be time to start that debate again.",
    " Title: Former CIA Agent Claims Islamic State Cells Present in U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer CIA agent Bob Baer has stated that Islamic State (ISIS) cells are present within the United States, with some members having entered the country by crossing the Mexican border. Baer made these comments during an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Baer, intelligence agencies are aware of some individuals they suspect of being ISIS members and are working to gather evidence to apprehend them. However, they fear there may be more individuals they are not yet aware of.\n\nISIS, currently known as the Islamic State, has taken control of large portions of Syria and Iraq, claiming to have established a caliphate from which they plan to wage global jihad. A spokesman recently stated that ISIS intends to raise the Islamic flag in the White House.\n\nOn Tuesday, ISIS released a video featuring American journalist Steven Sotloff, marking the second such video in the past two weeks. The group had previously threatened to behead Sotloff if the United States did not cease airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. American journalist James Foley was beheaded in a previous video.\n\nBaer suggested that the killings of Foley and Sotloff were a response to U.S. airstrikes hindering ISIS' efforts in Iraq. \"They have no choice in their minds but to strike back,\" Baer said.\n\nAt least four Americans are publicly known to be held by ISIS, according to Baer, who stated that the group essentially grabbed the first American they could to carry out their grisly actions and release them on video. Baer expects ISIS to continue beheading Western captives as they continue to be hurt by American attacks.",
    " Title: AstraZeneca-Oxford Coronavirus Vaccine Shows Positive Results in Early-Stage Trials\n\nArticle:\n\nAn experimental vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University against the new coronavirus has shown an immune response in early-stage clinical trials, according to data published on Monday. The vaccine, known as AZD1222, has been described by the World Health Organization's chief scientist as the leading candidate in a global race to halt a pandemic that has killed over 600,000 people.\n\nThe vaccine, which has not caused serious side effects and elicited antibody and T-cell immune responses, was developed by Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca, which has put it into large-scale, late-stage trials to test its efficacy. AstraZeneca has signed agreements with governments worldwide to supply the vaccine should it prove effective and gain regulatory approval. The company has stated it will not seek to profit from the vaccine during the pandemic.\n\nThe trial results, published in The Lancet medical journal, showed a stronger immune response in 10 people given an extra dose of the vaccine after 28 days, echoing a trial in pigs. However, the early-stage trial could not determine whether one or two doses would be needed to provide immunity.\n\nAstraZeneca's Chief Executive, Pascal Soriot, stated that the company is on track to produce doses by September, but the availability of the vaccine this year depends on how quickly late-stage trials can be completed, given the dwindling prevalence of the virus in Britain. Late-stage trials are underway in Brazil and South Africa and are due to start in the United States, where prevalence is higher.\n\nThe trial included 1,077 healthy adults aged 18-55 years with no history of COVID-19. Researchers said the vaccine caused minor side effects more frequently than a control group, but some of these could be reduced by taking the painkiller paracetamol. The antibody levels generated were \"in the region\" of those seen in convalescent patients.\n\nAstraZeneca's biopharma chief, Mene Pangalos, stated that the firm was leaning towards a two-dose strategy for later-stage trials, and did not want to risk a single or lower dose that might not work. The trial results do not provide information on the vaccine's efficacy in preventing COVID-19.",
    " Title: Trump's Economic Speech in Detroit: A Blend of Conservative Policies and Populist Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shift from his previous political rhetoric, Donald Trump delivered a policy-focused economic speech in Detroit on Monday, addressing issues of taxes, regulation, and trade. The speech aimed to unite Republicans and provide a more substantial policy agenda, following a week of controversy over his attacks on the family of a slain Muslim American soldier and his resistance to backing top Republicans in their reelection bids.\n\nIn the speech, Trump emphasized the need for \"only great and well-crafted trade deals where we as a country for once benefit.\" However, he also appealed to his \"America first\" philosophy by stating, \"Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.\"\n\nThe speech was met with 13 interruptions from protesters, but Trump remained calm and delivered a policy agenda that Republicans could potentially rally around. The agenda included:\n\n1. Adopting the House Republican proposal for individual income tax rates, which would lower the top federal rate (currently 39.6 percent) and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three \u2013 33 percent, 25 percent, and 12 percent.\n2. Reducing the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.\n3. Allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of child-care spending from their taxes.\n4. Tariffs against any countries that \"cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods.\"\n\nTrump's tax plan is projected to raise more revenue than his earlier proposal, which had been forecast to cost $10 trillion over a decade. However, economist Jared Bernstein, a former member of President Obama's economic team, questions the plan's benefits for average families and sees a significant loophole for the wealthy in Trump's plan for \"pass-through\" income.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, president of American Action Forum and the chief economic adviser to GOP presidential nominee John McCain in 2008, calls Trump's tax plan a \"peace offering to House Republicans\" but also notes Trump's outreach to labor by adopting Democratic positions on trade and infrastructure. Trump's infrastructure plan is said to be double what Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is proposing.\n\nHowever, Holtz-Eakin criticizes Trump for his focus on reviving American steel, stating that it is not a forward-looking vision. Economist Donald Grimes from the University of Michigan agrees that infrastructure spending is needed but notes that Trump provided no details and that there are limits to what the federal government can do alone. Grimes also points out that Trump's trade protectionism may not align with economic realities, especially in Detroit, where the economy is not solely manufacturing.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's economic speech in Detroit presented a blend of conservative policies and populist agenda, aiming to solidify the Republican base and counter the narrative that he lacks substance. However, the specifics of his plans, particularly regarding infrastructure and trade, remain to be seen.",
    " Title: One Federal Employee Lost Job Due to Sequestration, According to Government Audit\n\nArticle:\n\nA government audit conducted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has revealed that only one employee in the entire federal government lost a job due to sequestration. The audit, released last month, found the only permanent cut came at the U.S. Parole Commission, which eliminated one position.\n\nSen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, commented on the audit's findings on Wednesday, stating that the audit shows the concerns over sequestration's impact on jobs were overblown.\n\n\"Despite relentless warnings about the dire consequences of sequestration's budget cuts, it appears sequestration resulted in only one layoff,\" he said. \"While that's good news for federal employees and other workers, it is devastating to the credibility of Washington politicians and administration officials who spent months\u2014and millions of dollars\u2014engaging in a coordinated multi-agency cabinet-level public relations campaign to scare the American people.\"\n\nA year ago, sequestration was a significant part of the political conversation in Washington. The cuts, which kicked in on March 1, 2013, reduced spending at nearly every federal department and agency. President Obama and Democrats on Capitol Hill warned of devastating impacts on government services and a major dent to the economy.\n\nCongress blunted some of the impacts, passing legislation to keep air traffic controllers and meat plant inspectors on the job. However, most agencies ended up coping with the cuts, which ran as high as 7 percent.\n\nThe White House famously closed itself to public tours, while other agencies took deeper actions. Seven departments or agencies did furlough employees, but even that was less than a third of government agencies and departments surveyed by the GAO. Instead, those 15 departments and agencies that didn't furlough employees ended up using leftover savings or cutting other programs.\n\n\"NASA slowed down development of the program that will allow the U.S. to stop relying on Russia for trips to the International Space Station. At the same time, NASA\u2014like most agencies\u2014did not furlough any employees,\" Mr. Coburn wrote in a letter to the White House budget office.\n\nHe asked Director Sylvia Burwell to explain why some programs were cut but federal employees were spared. The budget office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAccording to the GAO, nearly every agency or department affected by sequestration canceled or limited bonuses, cut travel and training, and limited overtime. Nearly half of agencies and departments offered employees early retirement or bonus payments to get them to leave early. However, most managed to avoid furloughing or cutting jobs altogether.",

Illing, in an article, outlines ten reasons why he believes Gore could bridge the party's establishment and progressive wings.\n\nAccording to Illing, Gore, who is not currently in office, has the cachet to unite the two factions of the Democratic Party. He notes that Gore's political life may seem distant, but his activism and business acumen have kept him in the public consciousness.\n\nThe proposal has received positive reactions from various media outlets, including Powerline, Newsbusters, the Legal Insurrection blog, and PJ Media, which summarize the trend as \"Anybody but Hillary!\"\n\nRumors about Gore's potential presidential bid have circulated for about a year, along with reports that he has become a vegetarian. However, Gore has denied any interest in running for office and has been busy with climate matters and the \"Live Earth - Road to Paris\" concert, scheduled for September 19, to promote \"climate action\" with singer Pharrell Williams and other artists.\n\nIn a recent interview at an advertising awards symposium in France, Gore declined to back Hillary Clinton for the White House, stating that it was \"too early\" to weigh in on the matter. This response has sparked renewed speculation about Gore's potential candidacy.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Enforces Church Amendment Against University of Vermont Medical Center Over Abortion Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is taking action against the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMC) following a nurse's claim that her supervisors compelled her to participate in an abortion against her will. Jordan Sekulow, an attorney representing the nurse from the American Center for Law & Justice (ACLJ), stated on \"Fox & Friends\" that President Trump, through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the first president to enforce the federal law, the Church Amendment, which was passed by Congress in 1973.\n\nOn May 9, 2018, the anonymous Catholic nurse filed a conscience and religious discrimination complaint against UVMC, alleging they violated the law by forcing her to assist in an elective abortion despite her conscience-based objection. The nurse believed she was assisting in a miscarriage, but later discovered it was an abortion.\n\nIn response to the allegations, HHS's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has given UVMC, located in Burlington, Vt., 30 days to change its policies. Sekulow claims that UVMC's policy dates back to 2017, when the former CEO of Planned Parenthood New England came in as a new chairman of the Board of Trustees and the medical center started performing elective abortions. Sekulow asserts that the former Planned Parenthood chairman \"definitely has an animus to pro-life nurses, medical professionals, even doctors.\"\n\nUVMC responded Wednesday, stating they have \"robust, formal protections that safeguard both our employees' religious, ethical, and cultural beliefs, and our patients' rights to access safe and legal abortion.\" The medical center added they \"do not discriminate against any employees for exercising their rights to opt out of procedures to which they object, including 'termination of pregnancy.'\"\n\nSekulow contends that UVMC is disregarding the nurse's rights by stating, \"If we can accommodate you, we will. That's not the federal law that was passed by Congress. That's not what HHS enforces... You must accommodate the objector.\"",

That's our mission.\" He also emphasized the U.S.'s readiness to assist.\n\nPompeo further explained, \"Maduro has to see that this is falling apart on him. I said earlier today that he still rules, there's no way he can govern. The situation on the ground continues to get worse for the Venezuelan people.\"\n\nHe continued, \"This week, while Maduro managed to maintain control over the military in some regards, there were many military who left, a senior intelligence officer departed, a very senior official who had been closely connected to Maduro as well as his predecessor. He has to see how tenuous this is. He was in fact prepared to leave and then ultimately chose not to. He understands that time is limited and I think he's searching for as much leverage as he can get before he ultimately makes his departure. I don't know if that will be next week or a month from now, but the Venezuelan people can see conditions continue to deteriorate, and that means he can't maintain his presence there.\"\n\nAccording to Pompeo and other administration officials, Maduro was persuaded by the Russians to remain in the country after being ready to leave permanently for Cuba late last week.\n\nWhite House National Security Advisor John Bolton stated on Twitter about continued Russian interference, \"The United States will not tolerate foreign military interference in the Western Hemisphere. President Trump has made it clear that there will be costs for those who further Maduro's usurpation and repression.\"\n\nDuring his time in Finland, Pompeo will also deliver a speech on Arctic policy and meet with several leaders from the Arctic Council.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Return to Debate Preparations After Al Smith Dinner\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing a light-hearted evening at the Al Smith dinner, where President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney engaged in friendly banter, the two presidential candidates have returned to their campaign trails, preparing for their third and final debate on Monday in Florida.\n\nAt an event at George Mason University on Friday, President Obama continued to make jokes, but they carried a more pointed tone. \"Romney is changing up so much and backtracking and side-stepping, we've got to name this condition he's going through,\" said the president. \"I think it's called\u2026'Romnesia,'\" he added to cheers and laughter. \"I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.\"\n\nAfter campaigning in Virginia, President Obama will spend the weekend at Camp David preparing for the debate. Meanwhile, Romney headed to Boca Raton, the site of the debate, where he will hold a fundraiser and begin another round of debate preparation.\n\nThe debates this year have taken on an outsize importance, and as the race tightens, the stakes for Monday's faceoff could not be higher. Following their first matchup, Mitt Romney received his most significant polling boost all year. And following the second debate, President Obama had his best day of fundraising ever, including the 2008 campaign.\n\n\"This race is close,\" said Albert May, a professor of political communication at George Washington University. \"Anything that moves the polls a point or two is going to be important.\"\n\nMonday's debate will focus on foreign policy, an area of expertise on which the president has traditionally polled better. Last week's debate, however, exposed a chink in the president's record, particularly when it came to his understanding and announcing the causes for the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead.\n\nA new report out today suggests that the CIA station chief in Libya reported to Washington within 24 hours of the attack that there was evidence that terrorists were behind the assault. Romney has scored points on foreign policy by criticizing the president for not quickly and categorically ascribing the attack to terrorists.\n\n\"Of course the debate is important,\" said a Romney campaign staffer, unauthorized to speak for attribution. \"Given the president's shifting record on Libya, I imagine it will come up in a debate on foreign policy.\"\n\n\"On Monday, the President will discuss how he's kept his promise to the American people to end the war in Iraq in a responsible way, refocus on al-Qaeda, and put forward a plan to end the war in Afghanistan,\" said an Obama staffer on background. \"In contrast, all that Mitt Romney has offered in blunder and bluster. He said he would not move heaven and earth to get bin Laden. He called Russia, rather than al-Qaeda, our number one foe. He has failed to outline a plan to end the war in Afghanistan and even said he would have left tens of thousands of troops in Iraq.\"\n\n\"We need a President who not only keeps us safe in the world, but also understands the need for steady leadership and keeping us out of endless wars. On these points, Mitt Romney has failed,\" said the Obama staffer. \"This debate might not have as much impact as the first debate, largely because they've tested each other. It also might not just be about foreign policy, and it won't be just about Libya. They'll talk about Libya, China, and Russia.\"\n\nAccording to a comprehensive Gallup study, only two debates between 1960 and 2004 moved the meter and quantifiably changed the direction of the polls and the outcome of the election. But this year's debates seem to be altering the electoral landscape.\n\nFollowing the first debate two weeks ago, and a lackluster performance by Obama, Romney saw a sustained bounce in the polls, drawing him close to Obama or putting him ahead of the president nationally, according to a flurry of polls. The Obama campaign was bolstered today by fresh NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls that found Obama with healthy leads in two key swing states, holding a 51-43 lead over Romney in Iowa and a 51-45 lead in Wisconsin.\n\nThe debates matter in another way. President Obama had his best fundraising day ever following last week's debate in New York, according to the AP. The AP also crunched the numbers to reveal the biggest campaign contributors. Both candidates have big-name backers. Hollywood director Jeffrey Katzenberg, Obama's single biggest contributor, gave the campaign $2.5 million. And Sheldon Adelson, who has said he would be willing to give Romney $100 million, cashes in as his biggest supporter with a whopping $34.2 million.",
    " Title: Hispanic Advocacy Group Questions Hillary Clinton's Immigration Stance Following 2007 License Cancellation Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nAt least one Hispanic advocacy group is questioning Hillary Rodham Clinton's commitment to their stance on immigration, following former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's confession that he canceled driver's licenses for illegal immigrants in 2007 to support Clinton's presidential campaign.\n\nIn an interview with former Obama strategist David Axelrod, Mr. Spitzer revealed that the Clinton campaign had asked him to abandon the proposal to avoid complicating her 2008 presidential campaign, as she had struggled to answer whether she supported the policy during a debate.\n\nCarlos Vargas, co-director of the Dream Action Coalition, a group of illegal immigrant \"Dreamers,\" expressed disappointment, stating, \"Dreamers and Latinos are truly disappointed that Hillary Clinton would throw the immigrant community under the bus, especially since she has criticized others for doing the same.\"\n\nThe group noted that Clinton's record is becoming increasingly suspect as she attempts to secure the Democratic presidential nomination once more. Hispanic-rights advocates have been dismayed as they've observed both parties experimenting with legalization and pro-immigrant bills, only to abandon them when the politics become too challenging.\n\nThe issue of licenses for illegal immigrants was a contentious political debate in 2007, arising just a few years after the September 11, 2001, hijackers used valid licenses to board the planes they turned into missiles, resulting in the deaths of nearly 3,000 Americans.\n\nClinton initially avoided taking a clear stance on the issue, appearing to support and oppose it at different times. Eventually, she announced that she would not support states issuing such licenses. However, in her current campaign, Clinton has stated that she would now support such licenses.\n\nClinton's two major opponents for the Democratic nomination argue they have been consistent on Hispanic-rights issues throughout their careers, taking stands even when they were unpopular. The specific details regarding the Clinton campaign's request to Mr. Spitzer and the implications of this incident are not available in the provided source text.",
    " Title: Sanders Endorses Opponent of DNC Chairwoman, Criticizes DNC Process\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that escalates the ongoing tension between the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Bernie Sanders campaign, the Vermont Senator has endorsed the primary opponent of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. In an interview set to air on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Sanders expressed his support for Tim Canova, a candidate running in Florida's 23rd congressional district.\n\nSanders stated, \"Well, clearly, I favor her opponent. His views are much closer to mine than Debbie Wasserman Schultz's.\" Canova, who teaches at Nova Southeastern University Shepard Broad College of Law in Fort Lauderdale, was asked in 2011 to serve on Sanders' Wall Street reform advisory panel.\n\nCanova, in response to Sanders' endorsement, accused Wasserman Schultz of ignoring her home district's economic issues. \"In her own votes in the House of Representatives, I think she's making the problems worse,\" Canova told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield. He also expressed doubt that his political rival could heal intra-party rifts created during the primary.\n\nSanders sent out a fundraising email on behalf of Canova earlier in the day. The email stated, \"The political revolution is not just about electing a president, sisters and brothers. We need a Congress with members who believe, like Bernie, that we can not change a corrupt system by taking its money.\"\n\nIn a response to Sanders, Wasserman Schultz insisted she would remain neutral in the Democratic presidential race despite the Vermont senator's endorsement of her primary opponent. \"I am so proud to serve the people of Florida's 23rd district and I am confident that they know that I am an effective fighter and advocate on their behalf in Congress,\" Wasserman Schultz said. \"Even though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent, I remain, as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the presidential Democratic primary. I look forward to working together with him for Democratic victories in the fall.\"\n\nThe Sanders campaign has long been critical of Wasserman Schultz's performance as head of the DNC, claiming that the DNC has favored Hillary Clinton, Sanders' presidential primary challenger. Sanders and his supporters have complained about the nomination process and ways they believe it has helped Clinton, including debates held on Saturday nights, closed primaries in major states such as New York, and the use of superdelegates\u2014essentially free-agent party and union stalwarts who are overwhelmingly backing Clinton.\n\nCanova has called for greater regulation of Wall Street, writing on his campaign website that \"we are now in a new Gilded Age.\" Like Sanders, he also opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\n\nWhile Sanders has a strong ability to raise money and could impact the race, he did not fare well in Wasserman Schultz's congressional district during the March Florida presidential primary, scoring 30.1% of the vote compared with Clinton's 68%.\n\nThe ongoing feud between Sanders and Wasserman Schultz has been escalating, with Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, slamming Wasserman Schultz after she criticized the behavior of Sanders' supporters at the party's raucous Nevada convention last week. Wasserman Schultz has pushed back against Sanders' accusation that the party had rigged the system against him.",

The event, now in its seventh-decade, is known for its speakers poking fun at political figures, including themselves.\n\nHaley, a former governor of South Carolina, joked about her ethnicity and the recent DNA test results of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who claimed Native American heritage. \"I get it. You wanted an Indian woman, but Elizabeth Warren failed her DNA test,\" Haley said. She also added, \"When the President found out that I was Indian-American, he asked if I was from the same tribe as Elizabeth Warren.\"\n\nHaley, a Republican, also made light of her unexpected decision to step down as U.N. ambassador, joking about a rumor that rapper Kanye West had been sworn in as her replacement. \"Oh wait, that could really happen,\" she quipped.\n\nIn addition to her ethnicity and political career, Haley touched on the current state of U.S. politics, noting the \"toxic political environment\" that has led politicians to \"describe their opponents as enemies or evil.\" She emphasized, \"In America, our political opponents are not evil.\"\n\nHaley also made humorous remarks about her personal experiences, such as feeling prepared for being a Republican in New York due to growing up in rural South Carolina, and joked about encountering Attorney General Jeff Sessions on LinkedIn.\n\nThe high-powered crowd at the dinner included Governor Andrew Cuomo, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, CBS anchor Jeff Glor, and Wall Street financier Stephen Schwarzman. The event raised almost $4 million for Catholic children's charities this year. The dinner honors the late governor of New York and America's first Catholic presidential nominee, Alfred E. Smith.",
    " Title: Vice President Mike Pence Criticizes CNN's Coverage of Border Facilities, Denounces Comparisons to Concentration Camps\n\nArticle:\n\nVice President Mike Pence visited migrant shelters in the McAllen, Texas, area on Friday and subsequently criticized CNN's coverage of his trip on Twitter, labeling the news network as \"dishonest.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets, Pence stated, \"CNN is so dishonest. Today we took reporters to a detention facility on the border for families and children and all told us they were being treated well.\"\n\nThe vice president's tweets followed CNN's reporting of a large group of crowded migrants, primarily men, who were shown shouting \"no shower!\" to cameras. During the prime-time show Anderson Cooper 360, Pence's interview with CNN senior White House correspondent Pamela Brown was aired, but the broadcast split the screen, only showing the sizable group of male migrants, while none of the footage of Pence visiting with children was shown, according to Fox News.\n\nPence also defended U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents from the comparisons made by freshman Democrats likening holding centers to concentration camps during the interview with CNN. He asserted, \"The Nazis killed people. Our Customs and Border Protection as you heard today are saving lives every day.\"\n\nIn addition, Pence emphasized that the crisis at the southern border is not a \"manufactured crisis,\" but a real issue overwhelming the system. To illustrate this, he and his team also visited an overcrowded facility for adult men, many of whom had been arrested multiple times. These men were in a temporary holding area due to the refusal by Democrats in Congress to fund additional bed space.\n\nPence expressed disappointment that CNN did not broadcast the full story, focusing on the men in the temporary facility while ignoring the compassionate care being provided to families and children at other facilities. He concluded his tweets by stating, \"Our great @CBP agents deserve better and the American people deserve the whole story from CNN!\"",
    " Title: Trump's Call for Investigation of Clinton's Email Scandal and Comparison to Executive Power Abuse\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the recent presidential debate, a heated exchange between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton regarding Clinton's private email server and emails has sparked controversy and debate. Trump stated that if he wins the election, he would instruct the Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton's situation, citing numerous lies and deception. Clinton responded by commenting that it is good that someone with Trump's \"temperament\" is not in charge of the law in the United States, and Trump retorted, \"Because you'd be in jail.\"\n\nThis exchange has led to discussions about Trump's potential abuse of executive power and comparisons to a banana republic. However, the article argues that the focus on Trump's desire for Clinton's investigation overlooks the real anger over how Clinton seems to have been treated differently by the Department of Justice (DOJ) compared to \"normal\" Americans.\n\nThe article points out that Trump is not suggesting he can send Clinton to a prison cell, but rather that he will investigate her. Trump believes that an investigation will lead to her being held accountable for her actions. The article also notes that Clinton remains unconcerned about the potential seriousness of her private email server scandal.\n\nThe article also touches on the case of Jeffrey Hurant, the CEO of gay escort site Rentboy.com, who pleaded guilty to federal charges of promoting prostitution and forfeited $10 million in revenue. The article questions why there is more outrage about Trump wanting to have Clinton investigated by the DOJ than there is about the DOJ's treatment of Hurant and Rentboy.com.\n\nThe article also discusses Clinton's desire for a special prosecutor to examine trade deals between U.S. companies and other countries, and questions whether this prosecutor would target countries or American businesses who \"take advantage\" of sweet deals. The article also mentions Clinton's desire to name Supreme Court justices inclined to strike down the Citizens United decision, and the potential consequences of overturning this decision, including the criminalization of certain types of privately funded political speech.\n\nThe article concludes by reminding readers of the DOJ's targeting of speech that questions climate change science or goes after commenters who say unkind things about a drug war-promoting judge. The article suggests that the real outrage should be focused on the government's treatment of ordinary citizens, rather than Trump's call for an investigation of Clinton.",
    " Title: Philadelphia Safe Injection Site Moves Forward Despite Federal Objections\n\nArticle:\n\nA Philadelphia nonprofit's plan to open a safe injection site, named Safehouse, has been ruled not to violate federal drug laws by a judge, bringing the United States' first medically supervised heroin consumption facility one step closer to reality. The Justice Department had argued that the proposed site would violate the \"crackhouse statute,\" a decades-old law. However, Judge Gerald Austin McHugh ruled on Wednesday that Safehouse aims to \"reduce drug use, not facilitate it.\"\n\nThe Justice Department, in a statement by Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, has announced its intention to pursue further judicial review. The department also stated that it would take immediate action against any attempts to open illicit drug injection sites in other jurisdictions while the case is pending.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Safehouse in February, around the time it identified a location in Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood, home to one of the nation's largest open-air drug markets. U.S. Attorney William McSwain argued that Safehouse would be in violation of part of the Controlled Substances Act, passed in the 1980s, that makes it illegal to operate facilities for the purpose of drug use or distribution.\n\nHowever, many cities and states are already in violation of the statute due to the legal marijuana boom and the proliferation of needle exchanges. Judge McHugh noted that there's no evidence that lawmakers considered safe injection sites when writing the statute, as they weren't popular then.\n\nSafehouse would not supply the drugs. Instead, it would provide a place for people to inject intravenous opioids with clean syringes, with medical personnel standing by, ready to prevent an overdose. Participants could also access social services. This \"harm reduction\" strategy is favored by advocates and medical professionals, as it can help save the lives of people who aren't yet ready to get off drugs entirely.\n\nThe Trump administration has a different view. Last August, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein argued in an op-ed for The New York Times that safe injection sites would destroy neighborhoods like Kensington. \"Injection sites destroy the surrounding community,\" he wrote. \"When drug users flock to a site, drug dealers follow, bringing with them violence and despair, posing a danger to neighbors and law-abiding visitors.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has used the \"crackhouse statute\" to try to block or delay proposed sites around the country. With the opioid crisis still raging, ten countries\u2014including Canada, Australia, and Norway\u2014have safe injection sites, and several American cities have publicly mulled them, including San Francisco, Seattle, and New York. However, these efforts\u2014including a plan to authorize safe injection sites in California\u2014have been chilled by warnings of legal action from the Trump administration.\n\n\"Philadelphia is being devastated. We've lost about three people a day,\" Ronda Goldfein, president of Safehouse, told NPR Wednesday. \"And we say we had to do something better and we couldn't sit back and let that death toll rise. And the court agreed with us.\"",
    " Title: DNC Hack and Antifa: A Look at Media Bias and Government Bureaucracy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe narratives surrounding the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails and the Antifa movement have raised questions about media bias and government bureaucracy at their worst.\n\nIn 2016, U.S. intelligence agencies attributed the hack of DNC email accounts to Russia, leading to the publication of about 20,000 stolen emails on WikiLeaks. However, the finding was reportedly based largely on the DNC's strange outsourcing of the investigation to a private cybersecurity firm.\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has maintained that the Russians did not provide him with the DNC emails. When it was discovered that the emails had been compromised, then-DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz refused to allow forensic detectives from the FBI to examine the DNC server, prompting questions about the FBI's acceptance of this refusal.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, former FBI Director James Comey was put into the role of prosecutor, judge, and jury in the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. This proved disastrous, with Comey admitting under oath to deliberately leaking his own notes to the media to prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\n\nComey's investigation of Clinton showed no prosecutable wrongdoing, a judgment that in normal times would not be the FBI's to make. It has since been disclosed that Comey offered this conclusion before he had even interviewed Clinton, suggesting ethical adjustments may have been made.\n\nComey was also less than truthful when he testified that there had been no internal FBI communications concerning the infamous meeting between Clinton's husband, former president Bill Clinton, and then-attorney general Loretta Lynch on an airport tarmac. In fact, there was a trail of FBI discussion about that supposedly secret rendezvous.\n\nBefore he was fired, President Donald Trump drafted a letter outlining his anger, but it seemed to have little to do with obstruction of justice. Instead, Trump's anguished letter complained about Comey's private assurances that the president was not under FBI investigation, which were offered at about the same time Comey would not confirm that reality to the press.\n\nThe media has also faced criticism for its portrayal of the Antifa movement. Antifa rioters in Charlottesville were praised by progressives for violently confronting a few dozen white supremacists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis. The supremacists were pathetic losers without any public or political support for their odious views, and they were condemned by both political parties. Yet Antifa's use of violence was compared perversely by some progressives to American soldiers storming the beaches on D-Day.\n\nLater, Antifa thuggery in Boston and Berkeley against free speech and against conservative groups without ties to white supremacists confirmed that the movement was fascistic in nature. It was recently disclosed that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security had warned the Obama administration in 2016 that Antifa was a domestic terrorist organization that aimed to incite violence during street protests. That stark assessment and Antifa's subsequent violence make the recent nonchalance of local police departments with regard to Antifa thuggery seem like an abject dereliction of duty.\n\nDoubts about the official narratives of the DNC leaks and the errant behavior of James Comey, and misinformation about the violent extremists of Antifa, illustrate media bias\u2014not to mention entrenched government bureaucracies that are either incompetent, ethically compromised, or completely politicized.",
    " Title: Secret Service Agents Under Investigation for Alleged Impairment During White House Incident\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo Secret Service agents, Marc Connolly and George Ogilvie, are under investigation for alleged impairment while on duty, according to a report released by the Department of Homeland Security inspector general on Thursday. The incident occurred on March 4, when the agents, who had spent five hours at an Irish bar and restaurant less than a mile from the White House, allegedly drove into the scene of an unattended package investigation.\n\nThe report states that Connolly, the deputy special agent in charge of the president's protective detail, and Ogilvie, an agent, were probably \"impaired by alcohol.\" The inspector general, John Roth, released the report before testifying at a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nThe report details that Ogilvie bought 14 drinks in three hours at the bar. He told investigators he consumed fewer than three drinks all night, and Connolly said he had just two beers. Two other Secret Service employees said they consumed three drinks that Ogilvie bought, and he told investigators he gave away the rest but couldn't remember to whom.\n\nUpon arriving at the White House, Ogilvie drove his government-issued SUV past barriers that other agents had erected around the package they were investigating. His car passed \"within inches\" of the package, the report said. One officer on the scene, who has more than 25 years of experience, told investigators \"he had never seen anything like this.\"\n\nThe report also mentions that the incident is part of a series of embarrassments for the Secret Service, whose main job is to protect the U.S. president. The inspector general's office is investigating two more Secret Service incidents in March alone.\n\nIn one case, agents may have used agency computers to access the job application of Jason Chaffetz, now the U.S. House member who leads the committee with oversight responsibility for the service. In the other, a senior manager allegedly sexually assaulted a female subordinate after another farewell bash that involved drinking.\n\nRepresentatives Chaffetz and Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, released a joint statement on Thursday, stating that the report's findings point to the need for a \"major cultural overhaul\" within the Secret Service.\n\nSecret Service Director Joseph Clancy said in a statement, \"Behavior of the type described in the report is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.\" Connolly and Ogilvie have been placed on administrative leave, and the Secret Service's Office of Integrity has requested \"supporting information\" behind the inspector general's report. Once that information is reviewed, the service will propose disciplinary actions that the two agents can contest.\n\nConnolly has notified the Secret Service that he plans to retire, according to a government official who asked not to be identified.",
    " Title: Foreign Companies Warn of Intellectual Property Concerns in China as Chinese Industries Grow\n\nArticle:\n\nForeign companies have expressed concerns about the potential theft of intellectual property and pressure tactics used by Chinese partners and officials in various industries, particularly in renewable energy sectors such as wind turbines and solar panels.\n\nBusiness groups representing these companies claim that Chinese companies leverage corporate ties to coerce foreign partners into disclosing sensitive information. They also allege that Chinese officials have demanded access to technology as part of a review process to ensure product safety for Chinese consumers.\n\nRenewable energy, specifically wind turbines, is one area where China has employed these tactics to foster domestic industries. In 2005, Beijing mandated that 70% of each wind turbine installed in China must be domestically manufactured. Spanish wind turbine leader, Gamesa, trained over 500 Chinese suppliers to manufacture components for its turbines and set up a plant in Tianjin to assemble them. Other multinational wind turbine manufacturers followed suit.\n\nThe Obama administration questioned this policy as a violation of World Trade Organization rules, but by then, Chinese state-controlled enterprises had already begun assembling turbines using the same suppliers. China is now the world's largest market for wind turbines, and they are predominantly produced by Chinese companies.\n\nA similar industrial evolution occurred in solar energy soon after. China required that its first big municipal solar project only use solar panels that were at least 80% made in China. Companies rushed to produce in China and share technology. The Chinese government also heavily subsidized the manufacture of solar panels, primarily for export. Chinese companies ended up producing most of the world's solar panels.\n\nSome within the Trump administration fear a similar situation may arise in the automotive industry. Shortly after opening China to foreign auto companies, Chinese officials held a competition among global automakers to determine which would be allowed to enter the market. The competition included a detailed review of each company's offer to transfer technology to a joint venture with a Chinese state-owned partner.",
    " Title: FCC Balances Net Neutrality Demands with Cautious Approach Amidst Presidential Pressure\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is grappling with the delicate issue of net neutrality, as Chairman Tom Wheeler considers a hybrid approach that would regulate the relationships between content companies and Internet service providers, while leaving the consumer side largely untouched. This stance took a turn on Monday, as President Obama strongly endorsed full net neutrality, urging the FCC to reclassify wired and wireless broadband Internet as a \"common carrier\" service subject to strict government oversight.\n\nAlthough the FCC operates independently, it remains unclear how the Commission will reconcile the President's strong net neutrality stance with the more cautious plans it has been exploring for several months. In response, Wheeler released a statement on Monday, outlining areas of agreement and disagreement with the President's position.\n\nBoth the President and the FCC agree on the importance of an open Internet platform, where no players are favored over others, and Internet companies should not be able to block content or degrade its delivery. However, the FCC appears less enthusiastic about reclassifying Internet providers as \"common carriers.\" This classification would grant the government the power to ensure that companies such as Comcast and Verizon treat all traffic that flows across their networks equally.\n\nIndustry groups argue that common-carrier reclassification could stifle innovation, as government regulation might choke out the entrepreneurial spirit that led to the growth of the Internet in the first place. In his statement, Wheeler acknowledged that common-carrier reclassification \"brings with it policy issues that run the gamut from privacy to universal service to the ability of federal agencies to protect consumers.\"\n\nThe FCC is also keen on ensuring its case for rule changes is legally sound, following the D.C. Circuit Court's January decision to strike down its 2010 Open Internet Rules due to insufficient authority to impose the demands. Reclassifying broadband providers as common carriers would help establish the FCC's authority, but the Commission would need to prove that this change will benefit consumers and the Internet as a whole.\n\nWheeler emphasized the need for more time to examine the potential approaches and ensure that any changes can withstand legal challenges. The FCC aims to make a case that the chosen approach will benefit consumers and the Internet as a whole, as it navigates the complex and sensitive issue of net neutrality in the face of presidential pressure.",

The G7 foreign ministers aim to persuade Russia to cease its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after a tumultuous week that included the nerve gas attack and the U.S.'s airstrikes on a Syrian airbase.\n\nThe U.S. received broad support from Europe following the airstrikes. Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, who is hosting the meeting, stated that the missile strike contributed to a \"renewed harmony\" between the U.S. and its partners ahead of the first meeting of G7 foreign ministers since President Trump took office.\n\n\"We need to remember that not 10 years ago, but 100 or 120 days ago, the concern in Europe was that the United States and the EU were moving apart,\" Alfano told Sky TG24 Sunday. \"I welcome this renewed harmony.\"\n\nWith relations between the U.S. and Europe seemingly improving, there has been no indication that President Vladimir Putin is planning to change his stance on the Assad regime in Syria. Russia and Iran issued a joint statement on Sunday, stating that they would \"respond to any aggression\" in response to the airstrikes in Syria.\n\n\"What America waged in an aggression on Syria is a crossing of red lines,\" the countries said, according to The Sun. \"From now on, we will respond with force to any aggressor or any breach of red lines from whoever it is, and America knows our ability to respond well.\"\n\nH.R.

McMaster added that Russia will have to decide whether it wants to continue backing a \"murderous regime\" as Trump weighs the next steps against Syria.\n\nTillerson is expected to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov after the G7 meeting.

    " Title: U.S. Elections and Their Impact on Foreign Policy: A Neutral Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe upcoming U.S. elections are raising questions about the potential impact on foreign policy, as the two major candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, present distinct yet similar perspectives from an international standpoint.\n\nIn domestic terms, there is a significant difference between the two candidates, with Donald Trump being associated with white nationalist sentiments, as reported in various news outlets. However, from a global perspective, the differences between the two are minimal.\n\nTrump, who has been unpredictable in his campaign, could lead a party that has shown a willingness to consider extreme measures, such as Ted Cruz's proposal to bomb Syria. The possibility of the Republican Party, under Trump's leadership, taking charge raises concerns about the potential consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, Hillary Clinton, who has advocated for U.S. intervention in the past, such as her role in pushing President Obama to enter the Libyan operation, is perceived as having a tendency to initiate overseas wars. This tendency, according to some analysts, suggests a potentially dangerous approach to foreign policy.\n\nTherefore, from an external viewpoint, there is a valid reason to be concerned about the foreign policy decisions of either candidate, as both have shown a propensity for interventionist policies. As Medea Benjamin, an American political activist, stated in an interview, whichever candidate wins the presidency, a hawkish approach to foreign policy is likely to prevail in the White House.",
    " Title: GOP Candidates Face Criticism Over Minimum Wage Stances\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate over the federal minimum wage, Democrats have been pressing Republican candidates and officeholders to take clear positions on the issue this year. Most Republicans have expressed opposition to raising the federal minimum wage above its current level of $7.25 per hour.\n\nRecent surveys indicate that a majority of voters support increasing the federal minimum wage. However, in a speech before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie expressed opposition to raising the minimum wage, stating, \"I'm tired of hearing about the minimum wage... I don't think there's a mother or a father sitting around the kitchen table tonight in America saying, \u2018You know, honey, if our son or daughter could just make a higher minimum wage, my God, all of our dreams would be realized.'\"\n\nCritics argue that Christie's statement overlooks the fact that many workers are forced to take minimum wage jobs due to a dismal labor market. While Christie's argument is that most parents aspire to more for their children, the socially stratified nature of America with limited upward mobility suggests a need for measures to redistribute wealth and opportunity and invest in disadvantaged communities through increased education funding, public works projects, and the like.\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker also faces criticism for his stance on the minimum wage. Earlier this month, Walker's administration rebuffed a workers' coalition's effort to raise the state's minimum wage in accordance with a state law that calls for the minimum to be a \"living wage.\" The administration responded to their effort by asserting that $7.25 an hour is a living wage, despite MIT calculations indicating that a single parent would need to earn $21.17 an hour to make a living wage in the state capital of Madison.\n\nWalker also stated last week that the minimum wage does not \"serve a purpose,\" and he prefers to help Wisconsinites secure higher-paying jobs rather than raise the minimum wage. However, it is estimated that 500,000 workers in the state would see a raise if the minimum wage went from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour.\n\nThe Republican Party's approach to the minimum wage has been criticized for its perceived lack of sensitivity and disregard for basic facts. It is argued that minimum wage hikes do not lead to job losses and that most minimum wage earners are not high school students who just need a \"starter wage.\" However, the GOP's stance on the minimum wage remains largely opposed to raising it above the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.",
    " Title: President Trump Accuses Democrats of Meddling in Midterm Elections over Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump accused Democrats on Tuesday of meddling in the upcoming midterm elections by continuing the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In a series of tweets, the President referred to the 13 investigators working on the special counsel's investigation as \"The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama)\" and claimed they are \"meddling\" with the midterm elections.\n\n\"The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!\" Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nThe President also criticized the Democrats for not investigating Hillary Clinton's campaign, stating, \"Why aren't the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton. It's a Rigged Witch Hunt, that's why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!\"\n\nThe special counsel's investigation, which has been underway for just over a year, remains ongoing, and it is unclear when it may conclude. In another tweet, the President expressed his desire to focus his energy on other issues, such as North Korea's nuclear program, trade deals, the Veterans Affairs Choice program, the economy, rebuilding the military, and other matters.\n\n\"Sorry, I've got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.\" he tweeted.",
    " Title: Pew Report Reveals Political Polarization in American Attitudes Toward Climate and Energy Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report released by the Pew Research Center on Wednesday indicates a significant political polarization in American attitudes toward climate and energy issues. The report, which surveyed 2,002 adults in 2014, found that global warming is one of the issues most sharply divided across party lines, along with other climate and energy issues such as offshore drilling, fracking, and nuclear power.\n\nThe report reveals that only 27% of Republicans believe the Earth is warming due to human activity, while 71% of Democrats hold this belief. This trend of political polarization has been developing over the past two decades, with attitudes toward climate and energy issues continuing to diverge despite the science behind these issues remaining consistent.\n\nThe report found that party identification was more likely to determine a respondent's stance on these issues than even their level of education or scientific knowledge. However, respondents with a greater understanding of science proved less afraid of scientific advancements and futuristic-sounding technologies. They were more likely to support using animals in scientific research, approve of expanding nuclear power, and consider genetically modified foods safe to eat. They were \"especially likely\" to approve using bioengineered organs for human transplant.\n\nPolitics was not the only factor at play in other science-based issues, such as the safety of eating GMO foods, space travel, animal research, and biomedicine. Respondents were far less likely to have their views determined solely by their political leanings in these cases. Interestingly, in the case of evolution, religion played a central role in determining people's stances. However, those same respondents didn't necessarily use religion to determine their stances on other scientific topics.\n\nThe report also revealed a surprising correlation between political parties and government spending on scientific research. The majority of both parties\u201483% of Democrats and 62% of Republicans\u2014said government investment in scientific research paid off in the long run. This finding suggests a bipartisan agreement on the importance of government investment in scientific research.",
    " Title: Washington Post Places Story on Kavanaugh Coaching Basketball in \"Public Safety\" Category, Sparks Controversy\n\nThe Washington Post published a story on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh returning to coach his daughter's basketball team, which was placed under the \"public safety\" category, sparking controversy among conservatives. The story, which was published over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, was written by an author who has previously covered Kavanaugh and was automatically defaulted to the public safety category, according to a spokesperson for The Washington Post.\n\nThe story, which was not categorized as \"local,\" can still be found on a page cataloging the Post's public safety stories. The placement of the story above a story about a 6-year-old child struck by a bus in Charles County, Md., was criticized by National Republican Senatorial Committee member Logan Dobson, who questioned its placement.\n\nSeveral Twitter users, including Ashe Schow, Chuck Callesto, Just Jeff, The Daily Wire, and Ellen L. Carmichael, expressed their disapproval of the story's categorization, with some calling it \"gutter journalism\" and \"biased.\"\n\nBrett Kavanaugh, 53, was confirmed by the Senate mostly along party lines, 51-49, on Oct. 5. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) was the only Democrat to vote to confirm Kavanaugh.",
    " Title: Tom Steyer's $100 Million Climate Change Campaign Targets Key 2016 Races\n\nArticle:\n\nCalifornia billionaire Tom Steyer has announced plans to spend $100 million on the 2014 midterm elections to make climate change a prominent issue in this year's elections. However, sources familiar with Steyer's plan revealed that he might be willing to invest more than the initial $100 million, with a focus on key battleground states for the 2016 presidential race.\n\nSteyer's strategy involves targeting Senate or gubernatorial contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida, and possibly Pennsylvania. The strategy could position Steyer as a counterweight to big conservative donors like Charles and David Koch. However, the extent to which $100 million will impact the post-Citizens United political landscape, or whether climate change can compete with issues like jobs and the Affordable Care Act on the presidential campaign trail, remains unclear.\n\nSteyer's operation, through his NextGen Climate Action super PAC, aims to influence the debate about climate change in Senate races in Iowa and New Hampshire and the gubernatorial contest in Florida. He may also invest in the governor's race in Pennsylvania, where former Bill Clinton environmental aide Katie McGinty is running against Republican incumbent Tom Corbett.\n\nIn addition to the 2016 focus, Steyer's strategy includes targeting states where a candidate who supports action on climate change faces an opponent who denies climate change. This description aligns with the governor's race in Florida and the Senate race in Iowa.\n\nWhile Republican Governor Rick Scott of Florida has stated that science has not proven that humans are causing climate change, Democratic former Governor Charlie Crist, a potential challenger, has been a vocal critic of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill and held annual conferences on global warming during his tenure as governor. Scott is reportedly planning to spend up to $100 million for his reelection effort, potentially matching Steyer's entire nationwide campaign.\n\nFlorida is a significant example for climate advocates of how sea-level rise can threaten communities. Steyer also plans to target states that are crucial for determining whether Democrats can maintain control of the Senate in 2014, such as Iowa and New Hampshire. Furthermore, he aims to sway governor's races in states where the winner could take action on climate change without waiting for Washington. This could suggest involvement in Pennsylvania to support Katie McGinty or other Democratic gubernatorial candidates.\n\nDuring a gathering of wealthy climate donors at Steyer's ranch in February, Steyer and his PAC's chief strategist, Chris Lehane, outlined the approach. The event included a briefing on potential climate change effects from Columbia University climate researcher James Hansen, as well as fellow billionaires and some of Steyer's oldest friends from the financial community.\n\nThe New York Times previously reported that Steyer aims to spend about $50 million of his own money and raise another $50 million from green-minded donors for the 2014 elections. NextGen officials confirmed these figures but emphasized that $100 million is not the ceiling for what Steyer's PAC may spend this year.",
    " Title: Report Suggests Midlevel Bureaucrats, Not Congress, Initiated $4.2 Billion in Tax Credits to Illegal Immigrants\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by the Center for Immigration Studies, set to be released on Monday, claims that the federal government distributed approximately $4.2 billion in tax credits to illegal immigrants in 2010, a decision that was allegedly made by midlevel bureaucrats and has not received full congressional scrutiny. The report, authored by CIS fellow David North, alleges that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued these funds through the \"additional child tax credit\" (ACTC) to individuals using an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), a common indicator of an illegal immigrant.\n\nThe study suggests that the issue has been known for some time, but Mr. North delved into the data to examine the reasons behind this occurrence, stating that the tax credit expanded beyond its initial scope, and midlevel IRS managers manipulated the law, resulting in billions of dollars being paid to illegal immigrants.\n\nAccording to Mr. North, there is no evidence that the decision to allow illegal immigrants to collect the tax credit was made by top leaders at the IRS, and he asserts that it was not the intent of Congress. \"I've been in government, and I know how these things work out. It struck me that [GS-] 15s, 16s, got together at some point and decided this is how we should handle it, and it stuck,\" Mr. North said.\n\nDuring the government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, the IRS was unavailable for comment. In the past, the agency has maintained that it does not have the legal authority to deny illegal immigrants the tax credit and also disputes that it has the legal authority to deny claims without documentation showing that the children actually reside in the U.S.\n\nThe ACTC was created to assist those who earn too little to qualify for the full child tax credit. The ACTC is refundable, meaning that even if the taxpayer does not owe income tax, they could still receive a payout from the IRS. This setup, combined with the use of the tax credit by illegal immigrant workers, has led to an increase in fraud, particularly since the number of filers using ITINs has risen from 796,000 in 2005 to 1.5 million in 2008 and 2.3 million in 2010, according to the IRS's official auditor.\n\nThe IRS has attempted to limit the issuance of ITINs in an effort to reduce fraudulent tax credit payouts. The numbers are now valid for only five years, and a stricter review of identity documents is required. However, abuses still persist for existing ITINs, Mr. North argues.\n\nInvestigators identified one address in Atlanta where 23,994 ITIN-related tax refunds were sent, including 8,393 refunds deposited to a single bank account. Mr. North considered these strong indications of fraud. He also suggested that the IRS should look for cases where an ITIN filer goes from claiming no dependents to claiming four or five dependents the next year.\n\nMr. North used an auditor's report to identify a town in Delaware and another on Virginia's Eastern Shore with large concentrations of ITIN filers. Frankford, Del., had one address where 627 ITINs were registered, despite the town having a population of just 862. Parksley, Va., had a single address with 100 ITINs registered, in a town of 847 residents. Mr. North visited both towns and found that while Frankford seemed oblivious to the situation, Parksley was different. One tax counselor in town told him she suspected a rival business was responsible for the ITIN applications.",
    " Title: White House and Congressional Leaders Disagree on Impact and Necessity of Federal Spending Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House and Congressional leaders are at odds over the impact of the $85 billion in federal spending cuts, which are now in their second week. Gene Sperling, the White House's top economic adviser, stated on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the cuts will not have a significant immediate impact but will have a \"slow grind\" effect over the long term.\n\nIn contrast, President Obama and his Cabinet have repeatedly warned that the cuts will result in furloughs or pay cuts for middle-class wage-earners such as teachers, Capitol Hill janitors, and air traffic controllers, potentially causing 90-minute delays at major U.S. airports.\n\nSperling declined to directly address whether the worst-case-scenario rhetoric has hurt the president's credibility on the issue. Instead, he emphasized independent economists' forecasts that the cuts will result in 750,000 fewer jobs and slower economic growth.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that the cuts are similar to the average American's pay decrease when the payroll tax holiday expired. The Kentucky Republican argued that the cuts, known as sequester, are a \"modest reduction of 2.4 percent in spending over the next six months.\"\n\nCongress agreed to the sequester in 2011 after failing to agree on more specific reductions to defense and some domestic spending. The cuts were intended to be so drastic that Democrats and Republicans would be forced to compromise before they started.\n\nSperling rejected several Republican-backed plans and stated that no compromise would be reached unless the party agrees to tax increases. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., responded by stating that Congress agreed to such increases in January \"at the president's request\" and questioned why Obama and other Democrats will not agree to additional spending cuts.\n\nAyotte argued for potential pay freezes for federal employees and reforms to the federal food stamps program. However, she also stated she would consider tax reform that comes with entitlement reforms but would not agree to revenue increases to pay for additional government spending.\n\nEarlier on the show, Sperling said the Republican strategy is flawed because the cuts will take resources from several of the party's most valued positions, including national defense and border security. Sperling hinted at Democrats' likely strategy for retaking the House in 2014, stating, \"Our hope is as more Republicans start to see this pain in their own districts, they will choose bipartisan compromise over this absolutist position.\"\n\nSperling also dismissed a plan backed by at least some Republicans to give the president some flexibility in the cuts. He compared it to saying, \"You have to cut off three of your fingers but you can choose which ones.\"\n\nSperling also addressed an email sent to Bob Woodward in which he said The Washington Post reporter might \"regret\" writing a story that said Obama has \"moved the goal posts\" on sequester. He told ABC that he and Woodward share a mutual respect and he hopes they can \"put this behind us.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that any tax increases were unacceptable. \"I'm not going to do any more small deals,\" he said. \"I'm not going to raise taxes to fix sequestration. We don't need to raise taxes to fund the government.\"\n\nAll of this comes ahead of a new, March 27 deadline that could spell a government shutdown and a debt-ceiling clash coming in May. House Speaker John Boehner said his chamber would move this week to pass a measure to keep government open through Sept. 30. McConnell stated a government shutdown was unlikely to come from his side of Capitol Hill. The White House said it would dodge the shutdown and roll back the cuts, which hit domestic and defense spending in equal share.\n\nSperling said the White House is committed to trying to find a way that Republicans and Democrats can reach a compromise. The billions in cuts apply to the remainder of fiscal 2013, which ends Sept. 30. But without a deal, they will continue slashing government spending by about $1 trillion more over a 10-year period.",
    " Title: Global Economic Downturn Affects U.S. Job Market, Causes Concern Among Economists\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. job market experienced a setback in May, with the addition of only 69,000 jobs, according to a report released on Friday. This news, coupled with the ongoing debt crisis in Europe and slowing growth in China and India, has caused global financial markets to falter. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 2.22 percent, or 274.88 points, erasing its gains for the year, and the main index of the German stock market closed down 3.4 percent.\n\nYields on U.S. and German government bonds dropped as investors sought safety, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to another record low of 1.46 percent, and the German two-year bond falling below zero. The report has led to increased uncertainty, with manufacturers expressing concern about Europe's economic situation and its potential impact on global growth.\n\nEllen Zentner, the senior United States economist for Nomura, a financial services firm, stated, \"Manufacturers are very concerned about Europe because a blowup in Europe means a global slowdown.\" She added, \"It hasn't translated into layoffs\u2014businesses are just hiring less.\"\n\nCharles Ingram, vice president for marketing and sales at Eriez Magnetics, which produces industrial equipment, said the company was still hiring and still getting orders, but was closely monitoring the situation. \"We're very diverse, so if one or two industrial markets are down, we're O.K.,\" he said. \"But if there's a general recession, that would be a real problem, and that's certainly a possibility.\"\n\nThe jobs report showed gains in health care, transportation and warehousing, and wholesale trade, while construction jobs fell by a seasonally adjusted 28,000. Even some bright spots, like booming auto sales, failed to meet expectations or to bolster manufacturing employment by much\u2014only 12,000 jobs.\n\nGovernment job reductions also contributed to the slowdown, driven by cutbacks at the local level. Patrick J. O' Keefe, the director of economic research at J. H. Cohn, a consulting firm, said, \"It appears to me now that that was a premature call [that the labor market had achieved escape velocity].\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve could potentially step up its stimulus campaign in response to the slowdown. Several members of the Fed's policy-making committee have recently stated that they were not inclined to change current policy, but that position has always been contingent on continued growth. The economy needs to grow by about 125,000 jobs each month just to maintain the current unemployment rate.\n\nFears of a global slowdown were also evident in other economic data released on Friday. Cooling exports dampened the nation's major manufacturing index, though it remained in positive territory. This news came on the heels of several worrisome reports, including falling consumer confidence, an uptick in new claims for unemployment benefits, and a downward revision of the country's overall economic growth in the first quarter, to a 1.9 percent annual rate from 2.2 percent.\n\nThe jobs report is based on two surveys, one of businesses and the other of households. The household survey showed a net gain of 422,000 in the number of people employed, and also an uptick in the percentage of the working-age population who have jobs. However, David Rosenberg, the chief economist with Gluskin Sheff, an investment firm, said much of that gain was in part-time work, while the number of full-time workers fell.\n\nSome analysts said it was too soon to declare a significant slowdown. The recovery's roller-coaster trajectory may be largely illusory, the product of seasonal adjustment distortions and, this year, the unusually warm winter. Many economists say the weather effect, which caused some growth to occur earlier in the year than it otherwise would have, should be over by now. However, historically, May is the month that is most reduced after a warm winter. Seasonal adjustments were also making the winter look better than it was and the spring look worse.\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed, those who have been looking for work for more than half a year, rose by 300,000, even as hundreds of thousands of jobless workers lost their unemployment checks because of cutbacks. The long-term unemployed have the most difficulty finding jobs, and many of them say they have not seen any improvement in the job market.\n\nGlen Barry of Carmel, N.Y., who worked for the government at the county level for 25 years as a computer operator and was laid off in December 2010, said, \"Nobody has lists and lists of hundreds of available jobs. A lot of people work a job and a half now. Instead of having four people doing the work, they have two people doing the work.\"",
    " Title: Trump Announces Continuation of White House Coronavirus Task Force, Shift in Focus\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the White House Coronavirus Task Force, established in January to coordinate the response to the virus, will continue indefinitely and will shift its focus to reopening the nation and manufacturing vaccines. The announcement came a day after Vice President Mike Pence and other officials stated that the group's work would be transferred to federal agencies as soon as this month.\n\nTrump's latest thinking on the task force drew mixed reactions, with some critics arguing it was too soon to disband the group. However, the president left the composition of the task force and its focus somewhat unclear. Trump suggested that he may remove some members and add others, but did not specify who he had in mind. He stated that the group would focus more on \"safety\" and reopening the economy, as well as vaccine production.\n\nSpeaking during a trip to Arizona on Tuesday, Trump seemed to link a decision to disband the group with his broader desire to reopen the nation and recharge its economy. He suggested that winding down the group signaled a new phase in the government's response to the virus.\n\n\"I'm viewing our great citizens of this country to a certain extent and to a large extent as warriors,\" Trump said when asked about the task force. \"Will some people be affected, badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open.\"\n\nDemocrats and other critics blasted Trump's plan to reduce the scope of the task force on Tuesday, especially given the threat that death tolls would rise as states reopen businesses and other parts of their economies. The virus has killed more than 70,000 Americans, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of new daily cases has slowed but remains high. \"President Trump waves the white flag of surrender and winds down his \u2018 task force,'\" said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee. \"As the death toll soars, it is the task force that gets buried.\"\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the former Democratic presidential candidate, slammed the decision as a \"true American tragedy\" and predicted that \"thousands will unnecessarily die\" because of Trump's \"contempt for science.\"\n\nIn other news, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was hospitalized for a gallbladder condition and infection. The details of her condition and prognosis are not yet available.",
    " Title: Centrist Libertarian Ticket Gains Traction Among Moderate Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine has joined Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush in considering a vote for the Libertarian ticket, led by former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson and former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld. This development marks a shift in the political landscape, as the Libertarian ticket, traditionally associated with the rightmost precincts, is gaining traction among moderate Republicans.\n\nThe Johnson-Weld campaign has been emphasizing moderation, positioning itself as the \"sane\" and \"responsible\" choice, and focusing on problem-solving rather than fear and anger. This approach has resonated with voters in the center, with the Libertarian ticket drawing 8-10 percent in national polls.\n\nThe shift in the Libertarian Party's positioning is noteworthy, as it is seldom associated with moderation in U.S. politics. The party is often perceived as a balance wheel against the politics of factional revenge, upholding rights for all and a strong rule of law. In Europe, liberal parties, often seen as the nearest analogue of libertarian, are often perceived as occupying centrist or middle positions between labor or revolutionary parties on the left and blood-and-soil or religious parties on the right.\n\nThe emergence of the Libertarian ticket as a moderate force in the U.S. political landscape may not guarantee success as an independent force, given the country's first-past-the-post system. The German Free Democrats, despite an illustrious history, have come on hard times and are now shut out of representation in the Bundestag. Parties with similar traditions have struggled in Sweden, Italy, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, though they form governments in several other European countries either alone or as part of coalitions.\n\nThe development of the Libertarian ticket as a moderate force may have a significant impact on the political landscape, particularly after the November elections. The wider significance may come in how libertarian ideas are regarded by others and in how libertarians regard themselves. The shift in the Libertarian Party's positioning may signal a broader realignment in U.S. politics, with libertarian ideas potentially playing a more significant role in the center of the political spectrum.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows, Unemployment Rate Drops, and Wage Growth Remains Modest\n\nArticle:\n\nThe pace of hiring in the United States is beginning to slow, according to a report released recently. After the longest stretch of uninterrupted job growth on record, many economists anticipate a decrease in the rate of hiring as employers face increasing difficulties in finding new workers. The U.S. economy added 164,000 jobs in April, compared to a monthly average of 191,000 additions over the past year.\n\nThe unemployment rate has also decreased, falling to 3.9% in April after remaining at 4.1% for six consecutive months. The decline was partly due to a decrease in the labor force participation rate, a statistic that some economists interpret as a potential sign of decreasing job optimism among the population. However, economists expect the unemployment rate to continue declining in the coming months, with the Federal Reserve forecasting a 3.6% rate for next year.\n\nWage growth, despite the tightening labor market, remains sluggish. Wages rose 2.6% from a year earlier in April, extending a period of slow growth that has puzzled many policymakers and investors. Although some companies have reported labor shortages and increased hiring costs, this has not yet had a significant impact on overall wage inflation.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's monetary policy is unlikely to be significantly affected by these trends, as the report shows the same broad economic trends persist: the economy is generally strong, but inflation does not appear to be escalating out of control. This allows the central bank to raise interest rates next month, as well as consider one or two more increases later in the year, according to economists. Investors see a slightly lower chance of at least four rate increases this year, but the probability remains above where it was a few months ago.\n\nInterpreting market reactions to jobs reports has become increasingly challenging, as the economy enters the later stages of its cycle. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, a measure of the U.S. currency's strength, jumped immediately after the jobs report, typically a sign of a strong report. However, benchmark Treasury yields were down, suggesting some investors see weakness in the numbers. This phenomenon has been observed in recent jobs reports, partly because it is becoming more difficult to interpret the numbers as the economy matures.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Proposes Expansion of Estate Tax, Countering Senate Republicans' Elimination Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nBernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and potential 2020 presidential candidate, has unveiled a proposal to significantly expand the estate tax, a levy that has diminished over the years. Simultaneously, Senate Republicans are working to abolish the estate tax entirely.\n\nSanders' new proposal, titled the \"For the 99.8 Percent Act,\" would leave the majority of estates untaxed while implementing a graduated rate structure for the estates of the extremely wealthy, peaking at a maximum rate of 77 percent. This policy would, in essence, mirror Sen. Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax proposal, although the specific implementation details differ.\n\nBoth senators aim to generate revenue from the wealthiest Americans and deter the accumulation of vast dynastic wealth. Their plans share a common goal, yet they pursue different routes. The US tax law previously allowed rich individuals to pass down $5.5 million untaxed to their heirs, but the 2017 Trump tax bill doubled that exemption to $11 million. Earlier this week, Senate Republicans introduced legislation to eliminate the estate tax entirely, allowing billions to pass tax-free from today's rich individuals to their children.\n\nSanders' 2016 campaign proposed a lower top rate for a similar plan. In the new proposal, Sanders suggests a multi-tiered structure for taxing the largest estates, including:\n\n* A 55 percent bracket on wealth from $50 million to $1 billion\n* A 50 percent bracket from $10 million to $50 million\n* A 45 percent bracket from $3.5 million to $10 million\n\nThe majority of Americans do not inherit nearly that much money, but these relatively high rates would significantly impact the tax liability of the wealthiest American families. For instance, Sanders' staff estimates that Warren Buffett's tax liability would nearly double, from $33 billion to $64 billion.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, Sanders aims to raise revenue from the biggest winners of the past generation of economic change and break up the large fortunes that allow a small number of very wealthy individuals to exert disproportionate influence over the political system.\n\nConservatives typically argue against estate taxes, or \"death taxes,\" by citing the supposed problems of family farmers and other owners of illiquid assets. The real policy argument from the right, however, is that wealth taxes are a particularly harmful form of taxation because, over the long term, the accumulation of capital is the key to productivity and economic growth, and taxing wealth discourages that.\n\nSanders' staff estimates that his proposal would raise about $2.2 trillion in a 10-year window, but the exact nature of the window is uncertain due to the impact of his plan being highly sensitive to the exact timing of the deaths of a relatively small number of ultra-wealthy individuals.\n\nWarren's wealth tax proposal would levy an annual fee of 2 to 3 percent on large fortunes, and her team estimates it will raise $2.7 trillion in a standard Congressional Budget Office 10-year scoring window. These numbers are not exactly the same, but they are broadly similar and reflect the fact that these are essentially two different ways to reach the same goal. Warren's plan, by taxing large fortunes at a slow and steady pace rather than in a single huge spurt when someone dies, has the advantage of being less sensitive to timing issues, while Sanders' proposal may do a better job of tapping directly into the intuition that the government should try to prevent the emergence of an entrenched oligarchy.\n\nOn a more substantive level, experts in tax avoidance have, in recent years, tended to favor the wealth tax direction as perhaps easier to enforce. However, under either scheme, the avoidance issue is really going to come down to fussy details that neither senator has yet delved into.\n\nBroadly speaking, the message of these dueling plans is that the left wing of the Democratic Party is eager to tax the rich, but has not yet reached a consensus on exactly how to do it.",
    " Title: Trump Nominates Rick Perry for Energy Secretary, Despite Previous Call to Eliminate Department\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has reportedly nominated former Texas Governor Rick Perry to serve as secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy. According to CBS News and NBC News, Perry beat out two other contenders for the Cabinet post, Sen. Joe Manchin and Ray Washburne.\n\nOn Monday, Perry attended a meeting at Trump Towers but did not take questions from reporters. The Energy Department is the same federal agency Perry once wanted to eliminate. In a Republican presidential primary debate in November 2011, Perry infamously forgot the name of the department when asked which departments he would shut down.\n\nPerry's nomination comes despite his ties to the Dakota Access pipeline battle. He sits on the corporate board for Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Dakota Access LLC, which is pushing to build the pipeline. The Obama administration blocked the Dakota Access Pipeline easement through Lake Oahe, but the Trump administration is expected to take a different approach.\n\nThe president-elect, who has previously invested in Energy Transfer Partners and supports the pipeline, told Fox News Sunday he would intervene if the conflict isn't resolved by his inauguration.",
    " Title: Parliamentary Crisis and Brexit: A Look at the Current State of Affairs in the U.K.\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing Brexit process has significantly impacted the functioning of parliamentary democracy in the United Kingdom. This week, British Prime Minister Theresa May submitted her negotiated deal for withdrawal from the European Union to Parliament, a move that has been the focus of her premiership. The deal was rejected by a significant margin, with 432 votes against and 202 in favor.\n\nHistorians are finding it challenging to find a parallel example of a government's main legislation being so decisively rejected by Parliament. Typically, losses by 60 or 90 votes would lead to a prime minister's resignation or a no-confidence vote. However, despite the rejection of her government's primary piece of legislation, Theresa May's no-confidence vote was easily won.\n\nThe current situation in Westminster is complex, with two interconnected crises at play. The first is a crisis of responsibility in Parliament, as Theresa May's deal may not align with the hard Brexiteers' desires, but they lack the votes or the courage to oust May and face parliamentary and public scrutiny of their Brexit plans. They also do not have the votes in Parliament to pass their preferred terms.\n\nThe second crisis stems from the unique nature of the U.K. system, where Parliament is supposed to be sovereign. However, Brexit was decided by a national referendum, going against the media and parliamentary consensus. This has led to a situation where many Tory and Labour MPs, who campaigned on election manifestos committing to delivering Brexit, are against the project altogether. They hope to demonstrate that Brexit is harmful or \"impossible\" in some way, hoping that the passage of time will increase an ascendant majority for Remain.\n\nThe rejection of May's deal increases the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit at the end of March or the possibility of Parliament delaying or cancelling Brexit altogether, potentially leading to another national referendum on the issue. The U.K. government and Parliament are currently grappling with the implications of this unprecedented situation, and a solution to these twin crises is not yet in sight.\n\nParliament has expressed its confidence in May's leadership, but the vote was largely symbolic, as the government lacks a working political majority willing to stand behind any Brexit deal. The U.K. must either Leave or Remain, and it is up to Parliament to decide when and how.",
    " Title: Rep. Paul Ryan Distances Himself from Government Shutdown Tactics for Obamacare Repeal\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) has distanced himself from the idea of shutting down the government as a means to force the repeal of President Obama's health-care law, a tactic some Republicans, such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), have advocated. In an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Ryan stated that he is not in favor of a government shutdown as a strategy to achieve this goal.\n\nThe debate over the potential government shutdown is notable due to the Democrats' unwillingness to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a position that is unlikely to change. Furthermore, the Republican Party lacks the political leverage to compel Democrats to repeal the law. A government shutdown will not defund Obamacare, nor is it likely to alter public opinion about it.\n\nDespite these realities, many Republicans remain undeterred, and for good reason. The current discussion of a government shutdown to defund Obamacare highlights a shift in the character of Capitol Hill. The legislative process has traditionally been focused on numbers, with the most significant numbers being vote counts. Party leaders, such as House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), are among those who still adhere to these rules.\n\nHowever, a new breed of legislator prioritizes a different number: ideology. Senator Cruz hinted at this new political calculus in his remarks about repealing Obamacare at Young Americans for Liberty in Arlington, VA, on Wednesday. \"Right now, we don't have the votes... I'm going to be perfectly candid, we can't win this fight,\" Cruz told the 300 libertarian students. \"The only people who can win this fight are you. The only way we win this fight is if the American people rise up in overwhelming numbers and demand our elected officials to do the right thing and stand for principle.\"\n\nDemographics suggest that Young Americans for Liberty and like-minded voters may not have the numbers to make a repeal feasible. However, they can significantly influence the selection of the next Republican candidate for Congress during the 2014 primaries. This demographic shift is the math that fuels Cruz, or at least ensures that his shutdown-the-government views must be taken seriously by the Republican establishment.\n\nThe political polarization of America, particularly among Republicans, has replaced the old vote-counting mindset with an ideological one, where legislators prioritize standing firm for their constituents' demands, even if that is at odds with legislative realities. Cruz and his allies are seeking any legislative means available to achieve what their constituents want: the end of Obamacare. The fact that there are no viable legislative means at their disposal is less important than the attempt, as in their states, the Republican primaries virtually decide the winner, and failure in a noble cause is seen as better than accession to a hated one.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan, who holds views on strict financial austerity that elicit cheers from the ideologues, finds himself in a delicate position. He is also part of the old school, using his position as House Budget Committee chairman as a bully pulpit from which to move the Congress rightward and toward greater acceptance of his ideas on entitlement reform. He is an ideologue with real power, and therefore must tread carefully or risk losing either his clout or his aura.\n\nThe current political climate in Washington, D.C., is uncertain, with no clear direction as to how this situation will unfold. Tea party Republicans in the House brought the nation to the brink of a debt crisis in 2011 and feel they have only the sequester to show for it. For legislators who sought major entitlement reform, that is a disappointing return. The House's 40 failed attempts to kill Obamacare underscore the stakes as Republicans see it. If, instead of entitlement reform, America simply gets another entitlement, the die will be cast, and America will be put on the path to becoming another Greece, living beyond its means due to programs imposed upon the people by a massive and expanding government. Liberty will be dead, and the economy will not be far behind.",
    " Title: Secretary Kerry Discusses U.S.-Russia Relations and Syria Conflict at Indiana University\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry addressed a packed auditorium at Indiana University on Thursday, where he was speaking at the opening of a school of international studies. In his speech, Kerry referenced his 2004 presidential campaign, joking about his loss in Indiana.\n\nKerry's visit focused on promoting the Obama administration's recent international agreements, including deals on Pacific trade and Iran's nuclear program. However, he also addressed darker issues, such as Russia's intervention in Syria's civil war. Russian warplanes have been supporting President Bashar Assad's government for the third week, according to the Ministry of Defense, targeting what they claim are \"terrorist targets.\"\n\nThe U.S. has been struggling to find forces to oppose Assad and the Islamic State. After his speech, Kerry sat down with NPR's Steve Inskeep, discussing the challenge of convincing Russian President Vladimir Putin to target only Islamic extremists, not the Syrian rebels who oppose Assad.\n\n\"If they're supporting Assad, they're going to attract great difficulties for themselves and for any hope of a unified, secular Syria,\" Kerry said. \"Putin does not have a simple, easy track here,\" he added. \"This is not a situation where he's just moved in and taken over and everybody says, 'Oh, wow, he's doing something we couldn't.' No, he's not. He is not going to be able to stop the war by being there.\"\n\nRegarding the U.S.'s efforts to help U.S.-backed Syrians under attack by Russian aircraft, Kerry stated, \"We are now having that discussion with the Russians right now. I talked to my counterpart today, to [Foreign Minister] Sergey Lavrov. We raised the issue of this 'deconfliction' process. We're very near coming to an agreement on exactly how that will work, and my hope is that it will lead to a broader set of understandings about where the targeting ought to be and what is truly helpful and what is not.\"\n\nWhen asked about the goals of the \"deconfliction\" talks with Lavrov and whether they would go beyond keeping U.S. and Russian warplanes out of conflict with each other, Kerry responded, \"That's the immediate, that's the short-term, de minimus deconfliction, but it is possible that if you have adequate cooperation on the early steps of this horrible word 'deconfliction,' then it may be possible to actually engage in a broader conversation about how ISIL is going to be defeated, and who will bear what responsibility.\"\n\nKerry concluded by expressing uncertainty about Russia's full strategy in Syria, stating, \"It remains to be seen what their full strategy is in Syria.... If Russia is there to go after ISIL, and to in fact help prevent the takeover of the country and to secure a political track that could result in the end of the war, that could be positive. If Russia is there to uphold Assad, and fake it with respect to the extremists and terrorists, that's a serious problem.\" He also emphasized the need for nonviolence in the region, particularly from the Palestinians and their leadership.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Final Five Supreme Court Nominees Ahead of July 9th Announcement\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Trump has revealed that he will announce his pick to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on July 9th, with two women among the five finalists. The age of the finalists averages 48 years old, and their conservative backgrounds are undisputed. The president did not disclose the names of the finalists, but several legal analysts, sitting jurists, and confidential sources have identified the following as the \"final five\" for the high court:\n\n1. Amy Coney Barrett, 46, of the U.S. Court of Appeals (7th Circuit). A former editor of the Notre Dame Law Review and law professor at Notre Dame, Barrett was also a clerk for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. During her appointment by Trump to the Court of Appeals in 2017, she faced scrutiny from Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) regarding her Catholic faith and its potential impact on her rulings. Barrett responded, \"It's never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law.\"\n\n2. Joan Larsen, 49, of the U.S. Court of Appeals (6th Circuit). A graduate of the Northwestern University School of Law, Larsen has had a rapid legal career, serving as Deputy assistant attorney general under George W. Bush, justice of the Michigan Supreme Court from 2015 to 2017, and U.S. appellate judge for the past two years. A member of the Federalist Society, Larsen is also a former law clerk for the late Justice Scalia.\n\n3. Brett Kavanaugh, 52, of the D.C. Court of Appeals. Kavanaugh is a favorite of Washington, D.C. legal conservatives, particularly those who began their careers in the Reagan administration. A Yale Law School graduate, he clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. His judicial record is considered more conservative than his mentor, and he played a significant role in the impeachment of Bill Clinton by the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998. He was later appointed to the federal Appeals Court by President George W. Bush. In the Trump administration, Kavanaugh's biggest booster is White House counsel Don McGahn.\n\n4. Mike Lee, 47, Republican U.S. senator from Utah. Trump has mentioned Lee as a potential high court appointee, calling him an \"outstanding talent.\" Raised in law (his father, Rex Lee, was President Ronald Reagan's solicitor general, and his brother, Tom Lee, is a justice of the Utah Supreme Court), Lee clerked for Samuel Alito when the justice was an appellate judge. He also served as general counsel to former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman (now U.S. ambassador to Russia). Considered one of the most conservative of Senate Republicans, Lee would be the first sitting senator to be appointed to the high court since Harold Burton (Republican senator from Ohio) was named by Harry Truman in 1945, and the first Mormon to sit on the Supreme Court.\n\n5. Amul Thapar, 49, of the U.S. Court of Appeals (6th Circuit). Thapar would be the first Indian-American to sit on the high court. A U.C. Berkeley School of Law graduate, Thapar is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and has moved from being U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky, U.S. District judge from 2008 to 2015, and since last year, an appellate judge. As a minority, court-watchers say, he might be an attractive prospect for some Democrats in the Senate to support. McConnell and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have reportedly weighed in with the White House on his behalf.\n\nJohn Gizzi, chief political columnist and White House correspondent for \u2588\u2588\u2588, has reported on these potential nominees.

    " Title: Biden Reverses Position, Says He Would Comply with Subpoena for Impeachment Trial Testimony\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has reversed his earlier position and stated that he would comply with a congressional subpoena to testify in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. In a town hall in Fairfield, Iowa, Biden clarified his stance, stating, \"I would obey any subpoena that was sent to me.\"\n\nThis change in position marks one of the most significant and swift reversals by a candidate in the Democratic primary, according to the New York Times. The reversal came after a day in which the issue dominated his campaign, following his statement to the Des Moines Register's editorial board on Friday that he would defy a Senate subpoena.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Saturday, Biden emphasized his history of cooperating with legitimate congressional oversight requests. However, he also stated that he would not pretend there is any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for his testimony in the impeachment trial.\n\nWhen asked by reporters after an event in Iowa, Biden asserted that, since he has no first-hand knowledge of the events surrounding Trump's impeachment, there would be no basis upon which to call him as a witness. He also stated that he would \"honor whatever the Congress in fact legitimately asked me to do.\"\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of challenging a subpoena in court, Biden said it was too early to say. \"The answer is, I don't think that's going to happen to begin with. Let's cross that bridge when it comes,\" he said, adding, \"I would in fact abide by whatever was legally required of me. I always have.\"\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren also weighed in on the issue, stating that Biden should comply with anything that the Senate issues lawfully. Warren emphasized that the focus should be on Trump and his actions.\n\n\"Donald Trump is being impeached for abuse of power, and that's where our focus should be. Shame on him for trying to switch the focus over to something else,\" Warren told reporters in Iowa. \"Joe Biden has said that he has always abided by every lawful order, and if there's a lawful order for a subpoena, then I assume he would follow it.\"",
    " Title: Anonymous Donors Fuel Political Advertising Through \"Social Welfare\" Organizations in 2012 Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2012 presidential campaign, some of the heaviest advertisers are groups financed by anonymous donors, classified as \"social welfare\" organizations rather than political committees. Peter Overby, NPR's money and politics correspondent, reports that one such group, Crossroads GPS, is spending significantly on high-profile ads and is rivaling the campaigns themselves in ad spending.\n\nFour months before the election, the top three advertisers are President Obama's re-election campaign ($40 million), Mitt Romney's campaign ($32 million), and Crossroads GPS, which has spent $29 million so far. Crossroads GPS, classified as a \"social welfare\" organization for federal tax purposes, is one of the groups looming large in the campaign's ad spending.\n\nAccording to Overby, officially, social welfare organizations are classified under Section 501 (c) (4) of the tax code, which means they perform some kind of public or community benefit. They include groups like local volunteer fire departments, Rotary International, and the League of Women Voters. However, these organizations do not have to disclose their donors, creating a gray area where election law meets tax law.\n\nCrossroads GPS, led by Republican strategist Karl Rove, has run ads in Virginia criticizing the policies of President Obama and Democratic Senate candidate Tim Kaine. Rove recently explained to Fox News why the group can call itself a \"social welfare\" organization: \"It's a social welfare organization because it spends the vast preponderance of its money in furtherance of its social welfare goals. It's an issues advocacy group.\"\n\nCrossroads GPS, formed in 2010, shortly after the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling that loosened some campaign finance regulations, has raised $77 million in its first two years in existence. Overby reports that 90 percent of that came from at most 24 donors, making the \"social welfare\" organization approach appealing due to its anonymity.\n\n\"This is what makes the social welfare organization approach so appealing,\" Overby explains. \"You've got a couple dozen people who are able to play this incredibly powerful role in the election. It's anonymous. Nobody will ever know who they are. Not their business competitors. Not their political rivals. And not the voters.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Reiterates No-Weapons Policy for Ukraine as Obama Meets with President-elect Poroshenko\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama met with Ukraine's president-elect, Petro Poroshenko, for the first time on Wednesday, with the U.S. continuing to rule out providing weapons to help Ukraine fight against pro-Russian insurgents. Poroshenko, who will be sworn in on Saturday, has stated that he will ask for U.S. assistance, including training, advice to modernize Ukraine's military, and a grant of military equipment.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki reiterated this week that \"we'll continue to review their requests,\" but that the U.S. policy has not changed regarding lethal weapons. When asked by a reporter about providing such aid, Obama pointed out that during the Crimea crisis, the U.S. provided non-lethal assistance.\n\nWhile Russian activity will be a prime topic of their meeting, Obama and Poroshenko will also discuss energy supplies for Ukraine and efforts to rebuild its economy. \"We're going to spend a lot of time on the economics of Ukraine,\" Obama said.\n\nObama used his visit to Poland, a crossroads of the old Cold War, to intensify a new-style standoff with Russia over Ukraine. In meetings with Polish and Eastern European leaders, Obama unveiled a $1 billion plan to bolster security for NATO allies and warned Russia that further aggression in Ukraine will bring more sanctions.\n\nUnder the $1 billion plan, more U.S. troops would be rotated throughout Europe, with more land, sea, and air military exercises and training missions throughout the continent. Assistance would also be available for non-NATO nations on Russia's border, including Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova.\n\nRussian activity in Ukraine will also be the major topic when Obama attends the G-7 summit Wednesday and Thursday in Brussels. The president's trip wraps up Friday in Normandy, France, with a commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings. The ceremonies feature a number of world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has clashed with Obama over Ukraine.\n\nObama and Putin do not have a formal meeting scheduled, but Obama said he is sure he will bump into his Russian counterpart. He called on Putin to encourage violent separatists in eastern Ukraine to \"stand down.\" The president said that \"responsible behavior by the Russians\" could help rebuild American-Russian relations that have been \"shattered by Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.\"\n\n\"But,\" Obama added, \"I think it is fair to say that rebuilding that trust will take quite some time.\" Obama also said that \"further Russian provocation will be met with further costs for Russia, including, if necessary, additional sanctions.\"\n\nObama stopped in Poland to help commemorate the 25th anniversary of the nation's first free elections as the Soviet Union and the Cold War collapsed\u2014making Poland a perfect place for Obama to talk about national self-determination in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. World War II began after Germany invaded Poland in 1939, yet the Poles wound up as Soviet vassals. Poland played a major role in breaking up the Soviet Union after the birth of the Solidarity labor movement led by dock worker Lech Walesa.\n\nSince it gained independence in 1989, Poland has been a particularly popular stop for presidents in the post-Cold War era\u2014though Obama does have his share of local critics. Walesa himself, a former president of Poland, told a Polish television network last week that Obama has not been robust enough in the Ukraine crisis.\n\n\"The superpower has not been up to the job,\" Walesa said, \"and therefore the world is at a dangerous point and maybe it really is the case that lots of bad things are happening in the world because there is no leadership.\"",
    " Title: Uzbek Immigrant's Entry into U.S. through Diversity Visa Program Sparks Debate on Immigration Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe individual allegedly responsible for the deadly truck attack in New York City on Tuesday, identified as Sayfullo Saipov, entered the United States seven years ago through the Diversity Visa Program. This detail has become significant as President Trump proposes revisions to his \"extreme vetting\" program in response to the incident.\n\nThe Diversity Visa Program, a State Department program that offers a lottery for individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S., has been a point of contention following the attack. President Trump tweeted early Wednesday, \"The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit-based, not more Democrat Lottery Systems. We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).\"\n\nThe DV program makes up to 50,000 immigrant visas available annually, according to the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services website. Applicants must prove they have a clean criminal record, have a high school diploma or its equivalent, or have at least two years of work experience within the past five years to qualify.\n\nThe program was initially introduced in 1990 by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as part of a bill. Schumer's measure to make a set number of visas available to \"diversity immigrants\" from certain countries was absorbed into a larger House immigration bill, which was sponsored by Schumer and 31 others, including several Republicans. The program has been a subject of debate in Congress several times, most recently with the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act, which called for its elimination.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., sponsored the RAISE Act, and the Trump White House expressed support for the bill, calling the DV program \"outdated\" and stating that it \"serves questionable economic and humanitarian interests.\"\n\nIn response to Trump's comments, Sen. Schumer called on the president to rescind proposed cuts to \"vital anti-terrorism funding\" in his budget. \"I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution - anti-terrorism funding - which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget.\"\n\nFollowing the attack, Schumer kept his post-attack comments to praise of the NYPD. \"Thanks NYPD for rapidly responding to tragic situation downtown. Worried & saddened to hear about injuries & loss of life,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nThe details of Sayfullo Saipov's travel to America and his involvement in the attack are still under investigation.",
    " Title: The Comparative Privacy Concerns of Facebook and the IRS\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate about Facebook's collection of personal information from users, it is worth noting that another entity, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), is currently handling sensitive financial details from individuals, details that are not voluntarily surrendered. Unlike Facebook, users have no choice but to provide this information to the IRS.\n\nWhile Facebook's data collection practices, which involved third-party apps compiling detailed user profiles until 2015, were criticized for being intrusive, the information was based on data voluntarily shared through a service that users were not compelled to use. Those uncomfortable with Facebook's policies can choose to close their account or provide false information.\n\nIn contrast, individuals cannot avoid providing the IRS with details of their finances, businesses, properties, and families. The tax agency can impose penalties for failing to file a tax return or for failing to pay taxes by the deadline.\n\nNotable examples of the IRS's handling of personal data include Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, who was slapped with a substantial tax bill by the U.S. IRS due to his American birth, despite leaving the country by the age of 5. To avoid potential arrest upon returning to the U.S., Johnson paid the bill and renounced his American citizenship.\n\nThe purposes to which the IRS puts the extracted data are more concerning, as well. The IRS has a history of using the information for questionable purposes, carelessly storing data, leaking information through various channels, and hiring employees with questionable backgrounds.\n\nIn 2021, for instance, former IRS agent Ryan Payne pleaded guilty to using other people's Social Security numbers, information acquired during business audits, while applying for a loan and a bank account. Della Ornelas and Randall Ruff, who shared a long-term interest in combining tax collection with fraud, also had careers at the IRS, married, and eventually served prison time.\n\nIn February, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration expressed puzzlement in a report about the issuance of more than $1.7 million in awards to 1,962 IRS employees who had a disciplinary or adverse action, with some employees having serious misconduct such as unauthorized access to tax return information, substance abuse, and sexual misconduct.\n\nAdditionally, hackers have stolen over 700,000 Social Security numbers and other sensitive records from IRS computers in the past couple of years. Unlike the Facebook data, which contained information about preferences and beliefs that people voluntarily shared, the IRS data included information that few people would willingly provide without the threat of fines, penalties, and imprisonment.\n\nBreaches of IRS data can have severe consequences. In 2020, hackers extracted information on nearly 100,000 college students from the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, allowing them to steal upwards of $30 million. Victims of this breach remain at risk of ongoing identity theft due to the sensitive nature of the information the tax agency requires.\n\nIn 2013, the IRS paid out $5.8 billion in bogus refunds as a result of identity theft. The IRS is, therefore, a significant repository of sensitive information and, apparently, a less-than-ideal guardian of that data.\n\nAs users contemplate the potential uses of their pictures and posts on social media, a logical reaction when filing required information for tax day with the IRS is less annoyance and more a healthy dose of fear.",
    " Title: Early Voting Begins in Iowa, Democrats Seem to Dominate\n\nArticle:\n\nEarly in-person voting has commenced in Iowa, marking the first swing state to open polling sites. Residents can now vote in person at their local county auditor's offices or by mail, with some areas offering additional satellite locations. In Des Moines, a line of voters extended down the block at the Polk County Auditor's office on Thursday morning.\n\nPeter Clay, a 62-year-old supporter of President Obama, was among the early voters. He has volunteered for the campaign on his days off from his job as a zookeeper. \"It's important to have a lot of folks showing up today because it shows there's passion and energy in this campaign,\" Clay said. \"This is our first chance to show how much we care about the outcome and to demonstrate we want this president in office for another four years.\"\n\nDemocrats appeared to dominate in Johnson County, where polls opened in Iowa City. Victoria Walton, a librarian in Iowa City and an Obama supporter, said she had no reason to delay her vote until Election Day. \"I'm very concerned about the election, and I wanted to place my vote as soon as possible,\" she said. \"I've already decided, and the debates are not going to change my mind in any way. I've been listening carefully and thinking about this a long time.\"\n\nAleta Alexander, a 63-year-old voter from Waterloo in eastern Iowa, was among several voters who said they were volunteering for the Obama campaign. \"I voted for him in 2008 because I thought for sure he was the president that was for all the people\u2014not just blacks for whites or whatever but for everybody,\" she said. \"And I still believe that. So that's why I'm voting for him again.\"\n\nWhile there were Romney supporters, they were harder to find. Virginia Sourbeer, a retired state legislative staffer and former teacher from Des Moines, described herself as socially moderate. However, she said she was worried about the federal budget and spending in programs like Medicare and Social Security. Sourbeer said she trusted Romney more when it came to the economy. \"I just think that his background, for one thing, and his record in Massachusetts, that he dealt with difficult economic times there, that he'll deal with the issue,\" she said. \"Because we've had somebody who will not deal with the issue the last four years.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee's Iowa spokesman, Tom Szold, said Republicans had intentionally held off on most efforts to promote absentee voting until this week. He said they believed Romney voters would show up on Election Day if not before. \"It's common knowledge that the Democrats are ahead of us in this,\" he said. \"They start much earlier and they focus largely on their base. And we think that's because they're basically worried that their base is not going to turn out on Election Day.\"\n\nHowever, Erin Seidler, President Obama's campaign spokeswoman in Iowa, said promoting early voting made sense. \"We have 40 days to vote in Iowa. Why you would let any one of those days go by without getting folks to the polls is surprising to me,\" Seidler said. The Obama campaign has pushed early voting across the country, urging Iowans in particular to \"Be the First\" to vote for the president.\n\nDemocrats have requested the overwhelming majority of absentee ballots in Iowa. However, Republicans have an 18,000-person lead in voter registration. Polk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald said Democrats have a longer track record of working to get out the early vote. \"Recently Republicans have started doing it,\" he said. \"So the numbers are going to come a little bit closer. But the Democrats have been known for a lot of shoe leather, and working early.\"\n\nIowa is among more than 30 states that allow early voting. This report includes contributions from Clay Masters, Pat Blank, and Dean Borg of Iowa Public Radio, and Omaha Public Radio's Katie Knapp Schubert.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Concedes Presidential Election to Donald Trump, Vows to Respect Result\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton conceded the 2016 presidential election to Republican candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday, acknowledging the deep discontent among voters and expressing her disappointment. In a speech at the New Yorker hotel, Clinton, who became the first female presidential nominee for a major party, admitted that her political career may have ended with a dramatic thud rather than the glass-ceiling-shattering win she anticipated.\n\nClinton's defeat marked a significant shift in American politics, erasing the hope for a Democratic dynasty in the White House. The election results highlighted deep divisions within the nation and revealed the flawed nature of Clinton as a candidate.\n\nIn her concession speech, Clinton expressed empathy for her supporters, stating, \"I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too. And so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort.\" She emphasized the importance of respecting the election result and giving Trump a chance to lead.\n\nClinton's future is uncertain, as she faces ongoing scrutiny over her handling of classified information and questions about corruption within the Clinton Foundation. The State Department is still under court order to continue releasing emails from her private server during her tenure as secretary of state, and watchdog groups plan to continue pushing for more disclosures.\n\nThe FBI investigation into pay-for-play accusations involving Clinton's State Department and Clinton Foundation ensures that corruption allegations will not disappear with the end of the presidential race.\n\nPolitical analysts attribute Clinton's election loss to her being the wrong candidate at the wrong time, as well as the strength of Republican enthusiasm at the state and gubernatorial levels. Lara Brown, an associate professor of political management at George Washington University, stated, \"To not recognize the fact that this change election has been brewing is to miss the fact that the Republicans wiped the floor with the Democrats in 2010 and 2014, and to miss the fact that Republicans had been growing in strength across the states throughout Obama's tenure.\"\n\nClinton's candidacy was also marred by deep questions about her honesty and trustworthiness, largely due to her private email server and admitted carelessness with classified information. The FBI cleared Clinton of criminal wrongdoing, but critics argue that the investigation cemented the notion that she was a political elitist held to a different standard than other Americans.\n\nTom Fitton, president of the watchdog group Judicial Watch, stated, \"The corruption of Hillary Clinton was resoundingly rejected, and the frustration the American people felt was that she wasn't being held accountable.\" Fitton believes the incoming Trump administration should appoint a special prosecutor to renew a federal investigation into Clinton.\n\nBeyond the political and legal questions, Clinton's electoral defeat was a personal setback. Her attempts to break the glass ceiling of American politics have been thwarted twice, first by Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary and then by Trump in 2016. Clinton addressed this painful failure in her concession speech and encouraged young women not to be discouraged.\n\n\"To all the women, and especially the young women who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,\" she said. \"I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday someone will, and hopefully sooner than we may think right now.\"",
    " Title: Trump Signs Executive Order Promoting and Protecting Religious Liberty\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday, marking the National Day of Prayer, aimed at promoting and protecting religious liberty. The event, held in the Rose Garden, brought together evangelicals, Catholics, Jews, and others for a first-of-its-kind gathering.\n\nThe executive order reaffirms the government's commitment to upholding religious freedom laws and includes several key provisions. It directs the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to stop enforcing the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits churches and other non-profits from endorsing political candidates. Additionally, it protects the conscience of employers who do not wish to provide contraception and abortion-inducing drugs in their insurance plans, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe order has received mixed reactions from faith leaders. While some, like Ryan T. Anderson, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, view it as an important first step, others, such as Sen. James Lankford and the Alliance Defending Freedom, have expressed disappointment due to the order's lack of detail and the perceived need for more robust legislative action.\n\nCritics on the left argue that the order could lead to discrimination against gays, same-sex couples, and women. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) initially threatened to sue the administration but later announced it had decided against it.\n\nThe executive order's impact and effectiveness remain to be seen, with some faith leaders viewing it as a step in the right direction in combating the hostility Christians have faced under previous administrations. Franklin Graham, for example, expressed gratitude for a president who is concerned about religious liberty and is not afraid to mention Jesus Christ.",
    " Title: NRA Faces $100 Million in Legal Costs, According to Secret Recording\n\nArticle:\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) has reportedly incurred $100 million in legal costs due to ongoing investigations and internal turmoil, according to a secret recording of the organization's board meeting obtained by NPR. The recording, from a January 2020 meeting, reveals NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre's criticism of investigations by the New York and Washington, D.C. attorneys general, and his disclosure of $80 million in cuts to the NRA's budget to stay afloat.\n\nIn the recording, LaPierre, who is the CEO and executive vice president of the gun rights group, stated, \"The cost that we bore was probably about a hundred-million-dollar hit in lost revenue and real cost to this association in 2018 and 2019.\" He further explained, \"I mean, that's huge.\"\n\nThese figures, not previously reported, represent the first time LaPierre has quantified the financial impact of the ongoing legal battles. For context, the NRA and its affiliates raised more than $412 million and spent more than $423 million in 2018, the last year for which there is public reporting.\n\nTo weather the financial storm, LaPierre stated that he had reduced the size of the organization's budget by $80 million. \"What we did in order to survive and adjust is we took in 2019 and 2020... about $80 million in real costs out of the NRA budget,\" LaPierre said. \"I mean, we kinda reframed this entire association. We took it down to the studs.\"\n\nAlthough the NRA has maintained its membership level, LaPierre acknowledged that there is still much to be done. \"We're not out of the woods yet. We still got ta wrestle with this financial situation,\" he said.\n\nLaPierre also criticized the attorneys general of New York and D.C., comparing their investigations to oppressive tactics from autocratic regimes. \"I've never seen anything like that in the United States of America, to tell you the truth. I mean, that is Cuba, that is communist China, that is Venezuela, it's Russia,\" LaPierre said.\n\nThe offices of the D.C. and New York attorneys general declined to comment.\n\nThe recording was made during an NRA board meeting in Virginia in January, with board members, NRA staff, and a few dozen NRA members in attendance. Ron Carter, the vice president of Save the Second, an organization of NRA members advocating for financial reform and accountability within the National Rifle Association, was present.\n\n\"The repeated statement from LaPierre about the $100 million cost to the NRA should have come with an apology for having manifested the situation,\" Carter told NPR. \"The lack of accountability is troubling for many members.\"\n\nSave the Second is not associated with the recording obtained by NPR. The National Rifle Association did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe NRA announced layoffs and pay cuts in late March, blaming the coronavirus crisis for these measures. The coronavirus crisis also prompted the cancellation of the group's annual convention, which had been scheduled to take place this past weekend.\n\nWhile the coronavirus crisis has undoubtedly affected the organization's finances, the tape of LaPierre from January indicates that many of the organization's financial cuts were underway well before the emergence of the public health crisis. Legal costs remain a heavy burden on the organization, with the ongoing litigation between the NRA and Ackerman McQueen, its former public relations firm, indicating that the firm believes the NRA has paid its outside legal counsel \"over $54 million\" in the last two years.",
    " Title: Republican Proposal to Split 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Gains Momentum\n\nArticle:\n\nRepublican Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona have introduced legislation to divide the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, aiming to create a new 12th Circuit. The proposed legislation, if successful, would remove six states from the San Francisco-based court circuit, leaving only California, Oregon, Hawaii, and two island districts within its jurisdiction.\n\nThe proposed legislation, which was introduced last month, argues that the 9th Circuit is too large, too liberal, and too slow in resolving cases. According to Sen. Flake, the court currently represents 20% of the U.S. population and has 40% of the land mass within its jurisdiction, making it \"too big.\" He stated that it typically takes the court 15 months to hand down a decision.\n\nThe 9th Circuit has been a target of criticism from conservatives for years, often being referred to as the \"Nutty 9th\" or the \"9th Circus.\" The court's reputation as one of the most liberal in the country is largely due to its judicial makeup, with 18 of its 25 active judges having been appointed by Democrats. Former President George W. Bush appointed six justices, while former President Barack Obama appointed seven.\n\nUnder Flake's bill, the new circuit would cover Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Arizona, and Alaska, leaving the 9th with three Pacific states as well as the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam. A separate House version introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs and four other Arizona Republicans would leave Washington state in the 9th Circuit.\n\nEfforts to split the circuit go back to 1941, but carving up the large circuit is not without precedent. In 1929, Congress split the 8th Circuit to accommodate a population boom and increased caseloads.\n\nDemocratic strategist Joe Lestingi pushed back on accusations that the court leans left, stating, \"We don't complain about courts being too conservative. The truth is... the liberal side of that court provides the conflict we need to settle our most basic disagreements.\" He added that the 9th Circuit's track record of rulings being overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court is part of the judicial process.\n\nIn 1998, Congress appointed a commission to reexamine the federal appeals courts' structure, which ultimately recommended against splitting the 9th Circuit. However, the possibility of carving up the large circuit is not out of the realm of possibility.",
    " Title: Rep. Rashida Tlaib Meets with Controversial Pro-Palestinian Organization\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has been criticized for meeting with the Palestine Youth Movement (PYM), a pro-Palestinian organization that has been associated with violent rhetoric and support for terrorism against Israel. The meeting took place during the Arab Texas Festival in Dallas.\n\nThe PYM organization has a history of anti-Israel activity, including a 2018 event in San Francisco where attendees called for the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers. In Facebook postings, the organization has memorialized individuals involved in terrorist attacks against Israel, with at least three of those honored being known operatives of the Hamas terror group.\n\nIn addition, PYM has been involved in campus events, such as one at the University of California, Los Angeles, where attendees chanted \"long live the intifada,\" a phrase often used by those advocating armed resistance against Israel.\n\nIn July 2019, a PYM event in Toronto, Canada, was canceled after it was revealed that the group had hosted an event with a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a group that has committed terror attacks on Israel. In response to the event's cancellation, PYM blamed \"Zionist organizations\" for the campaign against it.\n\nTlaib's interaction with the group is the latest in a series of meetings with anti-Israel groups and supporters of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement that Tlaib has held. Tlaib and her freshman colleague Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) have also faced criticism for attempting to organize a trip to Israel sponsored by an organization called Miftah, which has praised supporters of terrorism and promoted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.",
    " Title: Rep. Mark Amodei Supports Impeachment Inquiry, Holds Judgment on Impeachment of President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) has expressed his support for the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, but has not indicated his stance on impeaching the president, according to a report by The Nevada Independent.\n\nDuring a conference call with reporters on Friday, Amodei stated, \"Let's put it through the process and see what happens. I'm a big fan of oversight, so let the committees get to work and see where it goes.\" He added, \"Using government agencies to, if it's proven, to put your finger on the scale of an election, I don't think that's right. If it turns out that it's something along those lines, then there's a problem.\"\n\nFollowing The Nevada Independent's publication of their article, Amodei released a statement reiterating his support for the impeachment inquiry but not necessarily impeachment itself. He stated that his position mirrored that of Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV).\n\nSen. Cortez-Masto told KTVN-TV, \"I think from all of that information, we have to follow the facts and figure out what happened here.\"\n\nIn response to a Nevada Independent reporter's article, Amodei clarified that the statement, \"Rep. Mark Amodei supports the House's inquiry into whether President Donald Trump should be impeached, but is withholding judgment on whether Trump has crossed the legal line,\" is accurate in the sense that both the House and Senate have unanimously supported a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the whistleblower complaint received on August 12, 2019, should be transmitted to the relevant committees. However, Amodei emphasized that he did not indicate support for impeachment and instead stressed his agreement with Sen. Cortez-Masto's statement.\n\nAmodei further stated that anyone who reads the article and believes there is a vote to convict before the process has played out is in individual fantasy. He expressed a desire to know the facts of what took place between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky.\n\n\"I think that's why we have the committee process. I won't attribute what was in the president's mind. That wasn't a great way to express concern about it. Part of what the committees will do is try to find some context for that and then based on what a fair reading of the context is, they'll go forward from there,\" Amodei told The Nevada Independent. \"I don't care if it was a partisan spy or not. The only thing I get a vote on is, if it comes to the House floor... do I think that there is evidence there that is credible, that says he broke a specific law?\"",
    " Title: FISA Documents Reveal Steele Dossier as Major Component of Carter Page Surveillance Warrant\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Department of Justice has released documents detailing the government's justification for the FISA surveillance warrant against Carter Page, a former campaign adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump. The materials include an October 2016 application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap Page, as well as several renewal applications.\n\nThe heavily redacted documents show that the infamous and unverified Steele Dossier was a major component of the 2016 surveillance warrant. The dossier, which was opposition research funded by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton campaign, contains salacious allegations against Trump. It was also a major component used to justify subsequent renewals.\n\nThe visible sections of the released FISA documents do not indicate the dossier was ever verified. Instead, the FBI claimed that Steele was \u201creliable\u201d based on his previous work. The FISA records also reveal that a September 2016 Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff was a significant part of the government's warrant application.\n\nHowever, London court records show that Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm behind the Steele Dossier. The newly released FISA warrant application, however, seems to indicate the Yahoo News article was an independent piece of corroborating information that justified the surveillance of Carter Page. Republicans question whether the story is an example of circular reporting that merely repeated information from Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that commissioned former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dossier.\n\nBased on what is visible, the dossier is not described to the FISA court as a political document, as the Democrats have asserted; in fact, the FBI speculates to the FISA court that it was commissioned to damage Candidate 1, who is Donald Trump. Page's denials of the Yahoo News reporting were included in the early renewals to the FISA application. The last renewal in late Spring 2017 is particularly important, as by that point, the FBI had dumped Steele as a source after he misled them over his media contacts.\n\nOne of the documents reads: \u201cThe FBI speculates to the FISA court that the U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit candidate 1\u2019s campaign.\u201d \u2588\u2588\u2588 believes that the U.S. person is Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS.\n\nThe unredacted FISA materials also contain only limited references to ex-Trump adviser George Papadopoulos. Media reports had speculated that Papadopoulos' 2016 meeting in London with a professor who had ties to Russia was a key justification for the FISA-authorized surveillance of Page. Papadopoulos has since pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe.\n\nCritics have charged that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who signed off on the FISA application renewals, should not have approved them without more reliable intelligence.\n\nReacting to the document release, Page told \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"I'm having trouble finding any small bit of this document that rises above complete ignorance and/or insanity.\" President Trump also weighed in on Twitter Sunday, calling the situation a \"scam.\"\n\n\"Looking more & more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC,\" Trump wrote. \"Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!\"\n\nThe surveillance of Page became a contentious matter between Republican and Democratic lawmakers earlier this year. Republicans alleged the FBI had abused its surveillance powers and improperly obtained the warrant, a charge that Democrats rebutted as both sides characterized the documents in different ways. The documents, meanwhile, remained out of public view.\n\nHouse Democrats were quick to say that the documents bolstered their arguments. \"For more than a year, House Republicans have bullied the Department of Justice and FBI to release highly sensitive documents to derail the Special Counsel's and other legitimate national security investigations and cover for the President,\" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. \"For the sake of our national security and our democracy, these vital investigations must be allowed to continue unhindered by Republican interference. The GOP must cease their attacks on our law enforcement and intelligence communities, and finally decide where their loyalty lies.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the documents underscore the \"legitimate concern\" the FBI had about Page's activities. Yet Schiff said the materials should not have been released during an ongoing investigation because of national security.\n\nSchiff blamed Trump for making public the House Republicans' initial memo about the FISA applications, a move by Trump that the congressman called \"nakedly political and self-interested, and designed to to interfere with the Special Counsel's investigation.\"\n\nEarlier this year, GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee voted to release a memo claiming the DOJ abused the FISA warrant process in order to hurt Trump's presidential campaign, claiming the warrant against Page was based in significant part on the Steele Dossier. Trump declassified the memo over the objections of the FBI, which warned that the document contained \u201cmaterial omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo\u2019s accuracy,\u201d the Hill report said. \u2588\u2588\u2588's Gregg Re and the Associated Press contributed to this story.",
    " Title: Senator Sherrod Brown Faces Sexual Harassment Allegation, Prepares Legal Action Against Republican Challenger Jim Renacci\n\nArticle:\n\nDemocratic Senator Sherrod Brown is preparing to take legal action against his Republican challenger, Rep. Jim Renacci, following Renacci's release of a statement Thursday evening accusing Brown of sexual harassment from 30 years ago.\n\nIn a lengthy statement by attorney Laura Mills, a \"very credible\" and \"professional\" unnamed woman alleged that Brown made an \"unexpected, uninvited, unwanted, and sudden advance, roughly pushing her up against a wall\" in the late 1980s. The statement did not provide details about when or where the incident allegedly occurred or the events leading up to that point. The two reportedly met through the course of her work.\n\nThe woman chose not to report the incident because it stopped in that moment, according to the statement. Ms. Mills is a former business partner and political donor of Mr. Renacci, according to Cleveland.com.\n\nOn Wednesday, Renacci told the Cincinnati Enquirer that he had heard from \"multiple women\" with abuse allegations against Brown.\n\nIn response, Brown issued a cease and desist letter to Renacci, demanding he stop \"making unsubstantiated and false claims about something that never happened,\" or else he would face \"legal ramifications.\" Campaign spokesman Preston Maddock said in a statement, \"Pure and simple this is character assassination by a failed and desperate candidate who every day reaches new lows. This will not be tolerated, all legal means will be pursued against Jim Renacci.\"\n\nRenacci has used Brown's contentious 1986 divorce and separate uncorroborated allegations of abuse as a way to paint Brown as hypocritical for voting \"no\" on confirming Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who faced his own allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nRenacci said in a statement Thursday that this new allegation raises \"even more questions and alarm over Mr. Brown's conduct toward women.\"\n\nAccording to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, Brown leads Renacci by 16 points in the Ohio Senate race.",
    " Title: Trump Pardons Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, Convicted of Lying Under Oath in 2007\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has reportedly signed off on a pardon for Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, who was convicted of lying under oath in 2007 in connection with the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity. The pardon, which has been in consideration for several months, was announced on Thursday evening, according to sources speaking to ABC News.\n\nLibby, who served as Chief of Staff to former Vice President Dick Cheney, was found guilty of obstructing justice and making false statements to a grand jury investigating the unauthorized disclosure of Plame's identity. The revelation of Plame's identity put her life at risk and was allegedly orchestrated as a form of retaliation against her husband, Joseph Wilson, who had publicly disputed claims that were used to justify the Iraq War.\n\nIn the aftermath of Libby's conviction, there was significant support from the right for then-President George W. Bush to pardon Libby, with the term \"witch hunt\" being widely used to describe the prosecution of Libby for the release of classified information and lying to a grand jury. However, Bush ultimately commuted Libby's sentence, allowing him to avoid prison but leaving his conviction in place.\n\nNow, Trump is granting a pardon to Libby, reaching back over a decade for this action. While it has been reported that the pardon has been on Trump's mind for months, the timing and the choice of Libby as the recipient of the pardon have raised questions.\n\nIn recent years, several individuals connected to the Trump administration have been charged and pleaded guilty to making false statements in connection with the ongoing investigation into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Michael Flynn, Rick Gates, and George Papadopoulos have all pleaded guilty to making false statements and agreed to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Alex Van der Zwaan, the first person sentenced in connection with the Trump\u2013Russia investigation, is currently serving time for making false statements. Before Van der Zwaan's sentencing, Mueller made it clear that he wanted jail time for the Dutch lawyer, emphasizing that knowingly making a false statement to an investigator is a crime with consequences.\n\nWith the pardon of Libby, Trump appears to be sending a message that lying under oath is not a significant offense, as he has the power to pardon anyone.",
    " Title: Trump Associates Face Growing Legal Fees Amid Investigations\n\nArticle:\n\nRoger Stone, a confidant of President Donald Trump, has stated that legal fees related to ongoing lawsuits and congressional inquiries will cost him at least half a million dollars. Stone has set up a legal defense fund at WhoframedRogerStone.com to help offset these costs.\n\nFormer National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has also established a website to help pay off his legal fees, as the financial burden of probes into Russia's alleged election interference grows for Trump associates.\n\nStone is being sued by Project Democracy, a group run by former Obama administration lawyers, for alleged involvement in the release of emails from Democratic Party officials. Stone anticipates that this lawsuit will cost more than the preparation for an upcoming hearing before the House Intelligence Committee on Sept. 26 and potential testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nStone told TheDC that he has spent around $100,000 to dismiss the lawsuit from Project Democracy. Stone and others in Trump's orbit are not the only ones facing burdensome legal fees.\n\nReuters reported Tuesday that President Trump is using donations to his campaign and the Republican National Committee to pay off some of his legal fees, a legal procedure. An RNC spokesman told Reuters that the party covered a little over $230,000 in legal fees for the president.\n\nThe Daily Beast also reported Monday that Flynn's legal fees are estimated to exceed $1 million.

    " Title: Progressive Groups Oppose Grand Bargain, Risking Economic Stability and Retirement Entitlements\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of progressive organizations, led by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, has expressed opposition to a grand bargain budget agreement in the upcoming lame duck Congress. In an op-ed published in the \u2588\u2588\u2588 newspaper, Trumka argued against any fixes to Social Security and Medicare as part of the agreement.\n\nThe opposition to a grand bargain could potentially harm the economy, negatively impact the middle class, and put retirement entitlements at risk. For nearly a century, progressives have worked to establish a secure and comprehensive safety net. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, this mission is largely accomplished.\n\nAs the nation approaches its most significant demographic aging period, the challenge is to maintain the safety net. A responsible approach to fixing the safety net requires a balance of measures that ensure the programs' health and solvency, including new revenue, modest reductions in benefits for some recipients, and a commitment to not raising payroll taxes for working-class people in the future.\n\nThe authors of the op-ed argue that over the past five decades, the top two progressive economic priorities have been on a collision course: public investments in people and jobs versus the safety net. In the 1960s, federal investments in infrastructure, education, research, and other areas outstripped spending on major entitlement programs by a ratio of 3 to 1. By 2012, the ratio was reversed, with the U.S. spending $3 on major entitlement programs for every dollar spent on creating economic growth through public investments. By 2022, the ratio will be 6 to 1. The authors contend that this trend line must change to create the economic growth and middle-class opportunities desired.",
    " Title: Trump Criticizes Bipartisan Immigration Proposal, Calls It \"Horrible\" on Border Security and \"Weak\" on Legal Immigration Reforms\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Wednesday expressed opposition to a proposed bipartisan immigration deal, labeling it as \"horrible\" on U.S. border security and \"very, very weak\" on reforms for the legal immigration system. The Senate proposal, aimed at addressing the demands for protections for young adults brought to the United States illegally as children and dubbed \"Dreamers,\" fell short of what most Republicans believe is necessary, according to the president.\n\nIn an interview with a news agency, Trump stated, \"It's the opposite of what I campaigned for.\" The plan, presented to Trump last week by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, was not detailed in the report.\n\nLast week, Trump drew international condemnation after reports emerged that he had questioned the value of taking immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean nation of Haiti during a closed-door meeting with lawmakers at the White House last Thursday, referring to them as \"shithole\" countries. Trump has since denied using that term.\n\nIn the interview on Wednesday, Trump declined to specify the words he used during the meeting, stating, \"I'm not going to get into what I said, but I will tell you, it was a tough meeting.\"\n\nMany Democrats have said they will not vote for spending legislation to keep the federal government funded past a Friday deadline without an immigration deal, and Republicans will need at least some Democratic votes to pass the funding extension in the Senate. Trump said a deal on immigration is still possible, stating, \"Time is running out.\"\n\nDemocrats said the negotiated plan addressed Trump's priorities, including $2.7 billion for additional border security funding. However, the proposal was criticized for not providing enough funding for the wall Trump has promised to build on the U.S.-Mexican border, a project opposed by Democrats.\n\nThe proposal was also criticized for being \"very, very weak\" on curbing visas for extended family members of immigrants and failing to end a diversity visa lottery program. Trump stated, \"Lindsey - he meant well - but I said, 'Well, how many Republicans agree with this?'\"\n\nTrump blamed Senator Durbin for leaking the language he used in the meeting, a disclosure that prompted critics to denounce Trump as a racist, an accusation he denied. Trump campaigned for president in 2016 promising a hard line on immigration, including deporting all of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country and a \"total and complete shutdown\" of the entry of Muslims into the United States. As president, he has signed three orders banning entry of most people from several Muslim-majority countries as well as rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.",
    " Title: Koch Network Launches New Super PAC Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Koch network, a powerful donor group associated with free-market billionaire Charles Koch, has launched a new super PAC, Americans for Prosperity Action, on Monday. This move bolsters the network's political influence ahead of the upcoming midterm elections in November.\n\nThe Americans for Prosperity Action super PAC allows the network to directly advocate for voters to support or oppose specific candidates. The new super PAC is an extension of Koch's long-standing grassroots wing, Americans for Prosperity, which operates in 36 states. However, the Americans for Prosperity group, being a nonprofit, faces restrictions on its political activity.\n\nSuper PACs, unlike nonprofits, can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence candidate elections, as long as they do not coordinate their spending decisions with the politicians they support.\n\nThe launch of the new super PAC follows tensions between Koch officials and President Donald Trump over trade and immigration policies. Koch's aides have criticized Trump's trade policies with China and other countries, labeling them as protectionist, which they argue will harm American businesses and consumers.\n\nThe rift between the two parties widened when the Republican National Committee warned Republican donors and GOP candidates using the Koch network's in-house data program to reach voters to avoid the Koch network and its political operation.\n\nIn a statement about the new super PAC, Koch officials stated they are \"committed to working with anyone to advance positive policies.\" The Koch network has not yet disclosed the amount they will spend through the new political committee, but they previously indicated they were likely to expend up to $400 million over the two-year election cycle to aid candidates and advance free-market policies.\n\nRepublicans are currently fighting to maintain their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where Democrats need to flip 23 seats to seize the chamber.

    " Title: Supreme Court's Decision on Asylum Policy Sparks Controversy, Concerns for Asylum Seekers\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to allow the implementation of a new asylum policy, which restricts asylum seekers from entering the United States at any point along the border, has sparked controversy and concerns among the left. Critics argue that the policy has questionable legal standing and could harm asylum seekers.\n\nThe policy, which is part of President Donald Trump's immigration agenda, has been met with opposition due to its potential violation of international humanitarian law and the United States' historical debt to Central America. The policy, they argue, disregards the legal rights of asylum seekers and ignores the country's responsibility to provide humanitarian aid.\n\nUnder U.S. law, individuals can seek asylum at any point along the border. However, it is unclear whether the Trump administration has the legal authority to enact the new policy, which is part of the ongoing legal challenge.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to allow the policy's implementation has been criticized for disregarding the health, safety, and legal rights of asylum seekers. The decision is seen as part of a troubling pattern of deference to the Trump administration's wishes.\n\nThe implementation of the policy is expected to push more asylum seekers into Mexico, a country that is ill-equipped to offer humanitarian aid. Asylum seekers in Mexico face dangers such as kidnapping, sexual assault, overcrowded shelters, and slim employment prospects. They also have difficulty finding lawyers, which significantly decreases their chances of having their asylum cases approved.\n\nMexico does not have the infrastructure to absorb tens of thousands of asylum seekers, nor does it have a legally robust asylum process. Individuals fleeing persecution in Central America, for example, on account of sexual orientation, are not likely to find protection in Mexico. The U.S. regularly accepts asylum seekers from Mexico who have suffered from the same kinds of persecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision was both premature and unnecessary, according to critics, and is part of a troubling pattern of deference to the Trump administration's wishes. The decision was made before the lower courts had a chance to fully consider the case, and it is seen as a departure from the Court's traditional approach to emergency action.\n\nThe increase in nationwide injunctions issued by district judges has been cited as a common response to the Court's aggressiveness. However, many emergency stays have been issued in cases where no nationwide injunction is at stake, or in more or less routine disputes over information the government must provide when it is sued.\n\nIn the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid, the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation. There is enough here to support impeachment, but whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter.",

In an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal, Scott W. Atlas of the Hoover Institution argues that the cost of implementing such a system would be prohibitive.\n\nFor instance, the estimated cost for single-payer healthcare in California alone is approximately $400 billion annually, more than twice the state's current annual budget. Nationwide, the cost of \"Medicare for All\" over its first decade is estimated to exceed $32 trillion. Doubling federal income and corporate taxes would not be sufficient to cover these costs, and further restrictions on health-care access could result.\n\nIn 2017, a single-payer bill passed by New York's state assembly would have cost $173 billion annually, significantly more than the state's current annual revenue. Even when factoring in savings from eliminated insurance premiums and co-payments, the revenue would not be sufficient to cover the costs.\n\nIn 2014, Vermont had to abandon plans for a single-payer system due to the estimated $2.5 billion annual cost, almost double the state's current budget, and the requirement for an 11.5 percent payroll tax increase and a 9 percent income tax increase.\n\nCost is not the only concern. Atlas points to waiting times in countries with single-payer systems, such as the United Kingdom and Canada, where long wait times for medical appointments and treatments are common. In contrast, wait lists are not a significant issue in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, Atlas argues that single-payer systems impose long delays in the debut of new drugs for cancer and other serious diseases. For example, in 2011, the Food and Drug Administration approved 32 new cancer drugs in a decade, while the European Medicines Agency approved 26. All 23 drugs approved by both Europe and the U.S. were available to American patients first.\n\nProponents of Medicare for All often argue that they do not want to fully nationalize healthcare, as Canada has done. Atlas counters that the poor and middle class would suffer the most under a single-payer system, as they would be unable to circumvent the system. He also notes that countries with the most experience with single-payer systems, such as Sweden and Denmark, are moving toward private provision of healthcare.\n\nAtlas suggests that the United States' healthcare system is flawed due to a lack of market-based solutions. He proposes ways to address issues such as pre-existing conditions, drug trials, and licensing of healthcare professionals without causing costs to spiral out of control.\n\nGiven the Republican Party's reluctance to engage in healthcare policy following the passage of Obamacare, it seems unlikely that market-friendly solutions will be implemented any time soon. If \"Medicare for All\" is adopted, the cost would be substantial, not just in terms of taxes, but also in terms of potential restrictions on healthcare access and delays in treatment.",
    " Title: Major Companies Under Scrutiny for Advertising on Russian Social Media Platform Known for White Supremacist Content\n\nArticle:\n\nOver 100 companies, including Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Adidas, and Reebok, have announced a boycott of Facebook in protest of divisive political speech. This move coincides with a public pressure campaign led by Joe Biden and other top Democrats to press Facebook to enforce stricter control over President Trump's postings. However, many of these companies, such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Adidas, and Reebok, have been regular advertisers on VK, a popular Russian media website known for its laissez-faire attitude toward online hate speech and a haven for white supremacists and neo-Nazis, who have been banned from Facebook.\n\nVK's popularity among white supremacists and neo-Nazis has been documented for years by media outlets and watchdog groups. Despite this, the companies that joined the Facebook ad boycott continue to market their products and brands on their VK pages, including Starbucks, Ford, Unilever, Colgate, Vans, The North Face, and Patagonia. On July 2, Colgate ran a promotion on VK offering prizes to members who purchased its products and used the VK app to scan the product code.\n\nCoca-Cola has run advertising campaigns on VK, including a controversial 2016 ad in which the company included the disputed territories of Crimea and the Kuril Islands on a map of Russia. Pepsi has also been an advertiser on the site and reportedly collaborated with VK on a payment app in 2018. Both still have an active presence on the platform.\n\nNone of the companies responded to inquiries about whether they would stop marketing on VK. Starbucks told the \u2588\u2588\u2588 that its temporary pause in advertising \"applies to all social media platforms.\" Microsoft, Honda, Reebok, Vans, Patagonia, Colgate, The North Face, Unilever, Pepsi, and Coca-Cola did not respond to request for comment.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League said VK has become \"an international hub for white supremacists\" who have been kicked off mainstream U.S. social media websites such as Facebook. Although VK has taken some recent steps to crack down on hate groups, organizations like the National Socialist Movement and the Ku Klux Klan still maintain an active presence on the website. Last month, Focus magazine reported the far-right Russian Imperial Movement, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, has been holding paramilitary training sessions for foreign white supremacist groups this summer, which are bookable over VK.\n\nVK also complies with Russian laws against \"gay propaganda,\" which prohibit content that is considered supportive of same-sex relationships. Several gay-rights groups were barred from the website last October after a judge ruled that their posts violated the law.",
    " Title: U.S. Coronavirus Death Toll Surpasses 9/11 Toll\n\nArticle:\n\nThe death toll from the coronavirus pandemic in the United States has surpassed the number of people killed in the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. As of March 30, the virus's death toll in the U.S. exceeded 3,100, surpassing the 2,977 victims who were killed in the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and four hijacked planes on September 11.\n\nWhile the virus is incomparable to the sudden deaths on American soil in a terrorist attack, its slow-moving toll on civilian lives promises to upend American society in peacetime as only terror has done. The number of confirmed cases is still rising rapidly, meaning many more people will likely die from COVID-19 in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nThe impact of September 11 went far beyond its initial death toll. Thousands of people were injured in the attacks, and thousands more died of diseases caused by exposure to toxic substances in the aftermath of the rubble of the Twin Towers. Its economic impact was similarly grim: In the three months following the attack, New York City's economy lost 143,000 jobs each month and $2.8 billion in wages, according to a New York Times report from 2004.\n\nThe coronavirus's effects will be far-reaching, as well. An estimated 160,000 people have been infected with the coronavirus in the United States, resulting in more than 20,000 hospitalizations and placing an unprecedented strain on the nation's health care system. In addition, more than 3 million people have filed for unemployment due to the shuttering of non-essential businesses across the country. As the economy stumbled, the Congress passed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package\u2014the largest of its kind in modern history.",
    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's Approval Ratings Skyrocket Following Sandy Response\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's approval ratings have surged significantly, according to three consecutive surveys over the past 24 hours. The Quinnipiac University poll, released Tuesday morning, indicates that 72% of Garden State voters approve of Christie's job performance, a 16-point increase since before the storm hit the state in late October.\n\nOn Monday, Christie announced his intention to seek a second term as New Jersey governor. The day prior, a Fairleigh Dickinson University survey showed his approval rating at 77%, a 21-point increase since late October. A new Rutgers-Eagleton survey also reported a 19-point jump in Christie's favorable impression, with 67% of respondents viewing him favorably.\n\nIn his re-election bid announcement, Christie emphasized his commitment to leading New Jersey through the storm's aftermath and the subsequent rebuilding and restoration process. \"The public needs to know that I'm in this for the long haul. The person who has helped to lead them through the initial crisis wants to be here to lead them through the rebuilding and restoration of our state,\" he said at a news conference.\n\nAccording to the Rutgers-Eagleton poll, 59% of New Jersey registered voters support a second term for Christie, while 32% oppose his re-election. In both the Quinnipiac and Fairleigh Dickinson polls, a significant factor in the increase in Christie's overall approval rating was a substantial rise in support from Democrats.\n\nMaurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, commented, \"Gov. Chris Christie never looked more like a 'Jersey Guy' than when he stood on the Seaside boardwalk after Sandy, and, just about unanimously, his New Jersey neighbors \u2013 Republicans, Democrats, Independents \u2013 applauded.\"\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential campaign, Christie served as a top surrogate for Mitt Romney and was considered a potential running mate for the GOP nominee. However, he faced criticism from some Republicans following Romney's loss for his appearance with President Barack Obama in New Jersey during the storm's aftermath and his praise of the president and the federal government's assistance to New Jersey immediately after the storm.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll indicates that the vast majority of New Jersey voters, including two-thirds of Republicans, view the GOP criticism of Christie as \"nonsense.\"\n\nThe news of Christie's re-election bid was widely expected. Much of the electoral speculation in New Jersey now centers on which Democrat will challenge Christie in the fall, with much of the focus on two-term Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who is seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party. Newark's Democratic mayor said in mid-November his decision on running for governor has been delayed due to Sandy.\n\nOther potential candidates include state Sen. Richard Codey, who served as governor for 14 months following the November 2004 resignation of then\u2013Gov. Jim McGreevey, as well as State Sen. Barbara Buono and Assembly member Lou Greenwald.\n\nAccording to the Rutgers-Eagleton poll, Christie has large leads over all of his potential Democratic challengers in hypothetical 2013 general election matchups.\n\nNew Jersey and Virginia are the only two states to hold gubernatorial contests in the year after a presidential election. Because they are the only contests in the election cycle, they often receive outsized attention.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll was conducted November 19-25, with 1,664 New Jersey registered voters questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.4 percentage points. The Rutgers-Eagleton poll was conducted November 14-17, with 1,108 New Jersey registered voters questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.",
    " Title: House Declines to Consider New Senate GOP Bill on National Emergencies Act\n\nArticle:\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced on Wednesday that the House would not take up a new Senate Republican bill aimed at curbing the National Emergencies Act. Pelosi stated that the goal was to constrain President Trump, not to address broader presidential powers issues.\n\nPelosi's comments came in response to a new bill by Sen. Mike Lee that would, in the future, limit a president's powers under the 1976 Emergencies Act. The bill would not apply retroactively to President Trump's recent border emergency declaration or to the more than two dozen other emergencies still in effect from previous presidents.\n\nDemocrats argue that the GOP is using the Lee bill as political cover to support President Trump's wall declaration, while also preventing future presidential power abuses. Senators face a showdown vote on Thursday on the wall declaration.\n\nThe House has already passed a resolution to overturn the declaration, and it appears that enough Republicans and Democrats in the Senate will approve it as well. However, President Trump has vowed to veto the bill, and there is not enough support currently to override him.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday that Republicans do not question President Trump's powers, but they have misgivings about his decision to divert funds from the Pentagon for additional border wall construction.\n\nThe president is invoking the National Emergencies Act, a post-Watergate piece of legislation that grants the Executive Branch strong powers to rearrange funds if the president declares an emergency is ongoing. In this case, President Trump plans to take more than $6 billion from the Defense Department for wall-building.\n\nSenate Majority Leader McConnell stated, \"I think most of my members now believe this is not a constitutional issue, but rather this grant of authority to any president, not just this one, but any president, was too broad back in the 1970s when it was passed.\"\n\nHis Democratic counterpart, Sen. Charles E. Schumer, said Republicans have long complained about an overbearing Executive Branch. This, he said, is their chance to reel it in.\n\n\"The vote tomorrow boils down to something very simply for our Republican friends: Do you believe in the Constitution and conservative principles?\" Mr. Schumer said.\n\nHowever, Republicans argue that Democrats are being hypocritical, as they did not object when President Obama claimed executive powers to create the DACA deportation amnesty, and Democrats also voted for border fencing in the past.",
    " Title: Vice Presidential Debate Moderator Faces Criticism for Question Delivery\n\nArticle:\n\nTuesday's Vice Presidential debate, moderated by Elaine Quijano, was met with criticism for its disjointed and unfocused nature. The conversation often meandered, with the candidates speaking past each other rather than engaging in substantive discussion.\n\nQuijano, the debate's moderator, faced criticism for her handling of the debate. David Axelrod, CNN's senior political commentator, observed on Twitter that Quijano seemed \"intent on running through her questions, even when significant exchanges are happening.\"\n\nOne notable example occurred when Quijano switched topics as Sen. Tim Kaine was pressing Gov. Mike Pence to explain why he had not defended his running mate Donald Trump on six different issues. Instead of allowing what may have been a revealing conversation to continue, she moved the discussion along.\n\nJeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic's national correspondent, tweeted shortly after that moment, \"Elaine Quijano should occasionally go where the debate is going, and not stop these interesting arguments.\"\n\nKenneth Li, the managing editor at Newsweek, asked, \"Why change the topic at the best moment?\"\n\nAt other times, Quijano seemed powerless to stop the candidates from bickering with each other. She was even forced to reprimand both candidates at one point, telling them, \"Gentlemen, the people at home can not understand you when you speak over each other.\"\n\nOn at least one occasion, Quijano was similarly powerless in getting the candidates to address her question. \"I'll remind you both, the topic was North Korea,\" she told the candidates as they attacked one another over the Clinton and Trump foundations.\n\nQuijano had an extremely challenging task, as there is only one vice presidential debate, and the format required her to address nine topics in just 90 minutes. Moreover, both candidates were more interested in attacking each other's running mates than answering the questions at hand. They also had two different styles, which made moderation difficult: Kaine was notably aggressive and interrupted Pence frequently, while Pence cast a more thoughtful, reflective posture.\n\nHowever, Quijano's performance served as a reminder that debates are not scripted events, and they require moderators who can be fluid and adapt to the direction the candidates choose to take the discussion.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans to Cede Control to Democrats Over Weekend Amid Ongoing Filibuster Dispute\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans are reportedly planning to cede control of the chamber to Democrats over the weekend, as a result of the ongoing dispute over filibuster changes on nominations. The move comes as Senate Republicans have been withholding unanimous consent to shorten debate periods and bring various nominations to the floor, slowing the chamber's schedule.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is aiming to get through four of the remaining ten nominations before adjourning for the year, with the process expected to continue into the mid to late weekend after working around the clock for the next couple of days.\n\nAccording to reports, Senate GOP Whip John Cornyn (Texas) has stated that it is up to individual senators whether they wish to stay in Congress on Friday and Saturday to vote on the nominees. Cornyn added that his leadership would ensure at least one Republican senator remains on or near the floor to object to Democratic requests to waive various procedural hurdles.\n\nA GOP senator, speaking anonymously, stated, \"I'm not sure how many Republicans will stick around.\" The senator continued, \"I don't think the Democrats remembered how important it is to get unanimous consent on little things to make this place work.\"\n\nThe filibuster changes have been a contentious issue, with Democrats arguing that the changes are necessary to expedite the confirmation process and allow the government to function more efficiently. Republicans, on the other hand, argue that the changes undermine the Senate's tradition of bipartisanship and the ability of the minority party to block nominations.\n\nRegardless of the political implications, it appears that the Senate will continue to operate under the new filibuster rules, with Democrats moving forward with the confirmation process and Republicans objecting where possible. The Senate is expected to adjourn for the year after the remaining nominations are confirmed or the weekend comes to a close, whichever occurs first.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Obama's Health Care Reform Law\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 5-4 ruling on Thursday, the Supreme Court upheld President Barack Obama's controversial health care reform legislation, a law that has been the subject of intense debate since its enactment in 2010.\n\nSpeaking from the East Room of the White House, Obama hailed the decision as a \"victory for people all over this country whose lives will be more secure because of this law.\" He emphasized that the legislation would provide greater security for individuals across the nation.\n\nThe high court determined that the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance, is valid as a tax, despite being deemed impermissible under the Constitution's commerce clause.\n\nObama acknowledged the contentious nature of the issue since he took office, but maintained that his push for the law was not driven by politics. \"I did not do this because it was good politics,\" Obama said. \"I did it because I believed it was good for the country. I did it because I believed it was good for the American people.\"\n\nThe political implications of the decision are expected to intensify as a major talking point on the campaign trail. Presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney has repeatedly pledged to repeal the law on his first day in office if elected president.\n\nIn response to the decision, Romney reiterated his commitment to repeal the law, stating, \"What the court did not do on its last day in session, I will do on my first day if elected president of the United States, and that is, I will act to repeal Obamacare.\"\n\nObama countered Romney's stance by referencing Romney's own health care law as former Massachusetts governor, a measure that Democrats claim served as the model for the federal health care law due to its inclusion of a mandate to buy insurance.\n\n\"Even though I knew it would not be politically popular, and resisted the idea when I ran for this office, we ultimately included a provision in the Affordable Care Act that people who can afford to buy health insurance should take the responsibility to do so,\" Obama said. \"In fact, this idea has enjoyed support from members of both parties, including the current Republican nominee for president.\"\n\nWith the Supreme Court ruling that the individual mandate is a tax, political analysts predict that Republicans will argue that Obama's legislation imposes a massive tax on the American public. However, Obama stated on Thursday that his administration will continue to defend the law.\n\n\"The highest court in the land has now spoken,\" Obama said. \"We will continue to implement this law.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Justice Kennedy's Contempt for DOMA Supporters Expressed in Marriage Equality Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a 5-4 decision on Wednesday, the United States Supreme Court, led by Justice Anthony Kennedy, struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman for federal law purposes. In his majority opinion, Kennedy expressed contempt for those who hold views contrary to the court's decision, labeling them as bigots and suggesting their views are not deserving of political representation.\n\nKennedy's opinion declared that DOMA inflicts \"injury and indignity\" on same-sex couples and denies \"an essential part of the liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment.\" He argued that the law is motivated by a \"bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group.\"\n\nIn the beginning of his decision, Kennedy briefly addressed federalism concerns, but it is unclear how the federal government cannot have a definition of marriage to guide federal policy and benefits. Ed Whelan of the Ethics and Public Policy Center points out that the federal government has numerous programs that require such a definition. For example, under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, a person who is legally separated but not divorced, or a person whose spouse is a nonresident alien, is treated as unmarried. Similarly, under immigration laws, a marriage entered into for the purpose of gaining an immigrant's admission will be disregarded even though that marriage remains valid under state law.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia, in his dissent, argued that DOMA serves a rather obvious purpose: to settle the question of whether a gay couple married in a state where it is recognized and moves to a state where it is not, the federal government should defer to the law of the state where they reside. DOMA, according to Scalia, settles that question. The full text of the dissent is unavailable in the provided source text.",
    " Title: U.S. Investigators Examine Role of Russian Lobbyist in Trump Tower Meeting\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. officials are examining the potential role of a Washington-based lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin, in a controversial 2016 meeting he attended between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, at Trump Tower. Akhmetshin, a dual U.S.-Russia citizen, confirmed his attendance to The Associated Press on Friday.\n\nThe meeting, which was arranged by Donald Trump Jr., took place in June 2016 and was believed to have been attended by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort. U.S. officials became aware of Akhmetshin's potential involvement in the meeting earlier this week. Three officials expressed concern about his role and are probing it further as part of their larger investigation into ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin.\n\nAlthough Trump Jr. has acknowledged meeting Veselnitskaya, he did not disclose the attendance of Akhmetshin, a well-known figure in the capital's murky world of foreign influence peddling. The lobbyist's role raises new red flags for U.S. officials as they study whether and how the Kremlin might have sought to exert influence over the 2016 Trump campaign.\n\nOne U.S. official referred to Akhmetshin as a known \"IO,\" or intelligence operative. In a March letter to the Justice Department, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) described him as having \"ties to Russian intelligence\" and \"alleged to have conducted political disinformation campaigns.\" Akhmetshin has denied those charges and declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nAkhmetshin and Veselnitskaya, who is alleged to have indirect ties to the Kremlin, previously worked together in Washington, lobbying against the Magnitsky Act, a bipartisan measure that imposed sanctions on several top Russian officials as punishment for the 2009 death in Moscow of an imprisoned lawyer who had exposed massive financial fraud.\n\nInvestigators are scrambling to understand the full context of the previously undisclosed meeting between Veselnitskaya and Trump associates, which The New York Times revealed earlier this week. Among the questions investigators are trying to answer is whether Veselnitskaya was sent to meet with Trump Jr. on direct orders from the Kremlin.\n\nThe June meeting at Trump Tower, which Trump officials say was brief and yielded no useful information, was arranged by a British tabloid reporter named Rob Goldstone, who now works as an agent representing Emin Agalarov, a Moscow pop star whose father is a real estate mogul close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Agalarovs hosted the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow; President Donald Trump owned the franchise at the time, attended the event, and befriended the Agalarovs, with whom he and his son, Donald Jr., remained in contact until at least January.\n\nIn an email days before the meeting, Goldstone told Trump that Veselnitskaya had damaging information on Hillary Clinton, which Goldstone said was \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\" Trump Jr. replied, \"If it's what you say I love it.\"\n\nAkhmetshin and Veselnitskaya worked together lobbying for a group called The Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative, a D.C.-based nongovernmental association that has lobbied against the Magnitsky Act\u2014a 2012 law that sanctions Russian officials for human rights abuses and subsequently infuriates the Kremlin.\n\nTrump Jr. has said his meeting with Veselnitskaya was dedicated largely to discussion of issues related to that law, which is named for Russian lawyer and whistle-blower Sergei Magnitsky, who died in 2009 after being allegedly tortured in a Russian prison.\n\nThe existence of the controversial June meeting was rumored for months, but neither the Senate Intelligence Committee nor, according to CNN, the FBI\u2014both of whom are probing potential ties between Trump's campaign and the Russian government\u2014knew the details before the Times published its stories.\n\nAkhmetshin\u2014whose lobbying tenure has included several high-profile efforts to promote the Kremlin's agenda in Washington\u2014has run afoul of Congress in recent weeks. In a March letter to the Justice Department, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley accused Akhmetshin of failing to register properly under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nAccording to a letter obtained by The Associated Press, Akhmetshin told the Justice Department's National Security Division in April that he is properly registered and did nothing wrong. \"It is my understanding,\" he adds, \"that Veselnitskaya is not 'an agent of a foreign government or foreign political party.'\"\n\nAkhmetshin told The Associated Press on Friday that he had been drafted into the Soviet Army and served from 1986 to 1988, but denied having any spy training.",

Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, criticized the president for \"militarizing\" the federal response to nationwide protests over police brutality.\n\nIn his tweet, President Trump stated, \"Probably the only thing Barack Obama and I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world\u2019s most overrated General. I asked for his letter of resignation, & felt great about it.\"\n\nMattis, who served as Defense secretary for two years before leaving in January 2019, criticized the president for not attempting to unite the American people. He described Trump as \"the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2014 does not even pretend to try.\"\n\nPresident Trump, in response, said, \"His nickname was \u2018Chaos\u2019, which I didn\u2019t like, and changed it to \u2018Mad Dog\u2019. His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations.\" It is noted that the nickname \"Mad Dog\" was given to Mattis in the military long before Trump was elected, as referenced in a 2013 San Diego Tribune article.\n\nThe president further stated, \"I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom \u2018brought home the bacon\u2019. I didn\u2019t like his \u2018leadership\u2019 style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!\"\n\nContrary to President Trump's statement, Mattis was not fired; he resigned after clashing with the president over the administration's policy in Syria.\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany also weighed in, describing Mattis' statement as \"little more than a self-promotional stunt to appease the DC elite.\" She tweeted that Trump \"is the law and order President that has restored peace to our nation\u2019s streets.\"\n\nMcEnany further stated, \"Mattis\u2019 small words pale in comparison to @POTUS\u2019 strong action.\"",
    " Title: New York Magazine's Eric Levitz Argues for a Shift in Mainstream Media's Perspective on Conservatism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent article for New York magazine, Eric Levitz argues for a broader range of right-leaning perspectives in mainstream publications, citing a discussion between Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg and writer Ta-Nehisi Coates about the recent controversy surrounding the hiring and firing of conservative journalist Kevin Williamson.\n\nLevitz references a leaked transcript of a discussion between Goldberg and Coates, in which Goldberg expresses a desire for intellectual diversity at The Atlantic, but Coates suggests that the lines of acceptable discourse should be shifted rather than narrowed. Coates argues that the publication could still have intellectual diversity without conservative opinions, as long as it focuses on perspectives that are further and further left.\n\nLevitz agrees with Coates' argument and provides two main reasons for doing so. First, he argues that most conservative opinion writers are irrelevant to the conservative movement in the age of Trump. Second, he asserts that conservative arguments are obviously wrong and not worth debating, while socialist arguments have yet to be debunked.\n\nLevitz argues that socialist arguments, such as the question of whether the means of production should be socialized, are still relevant and should be presented in mainstream publications. He believes that it is incoherent to declare conservative opinions uninteresting or beyond the pale while still debating the merits of socialism.\n\nLevitz also argues that extreme arguments may contain kernels of truth or contribute to the public's awareness, citing the liberal press's failure to anticipate the outcome of the 2016 election due to a lack of engagement with far-left perspectives.\n\nLevitz concludes by stating that showcasing various shades of opinion on the right is as vital as extending a platform to a newly relevant socialist left. He suggests that this might mean including a Trump-sympathetic writer from time to time, rather than another neoconservative, and recognizing that there are a whole lot of people who dissent from both liberal and leftist orthodoxy and have something worthwhile to say.\n\nNew York Times columnist Ross Douthat responded to Levitz's article, stating that there are conservatives representing various ideological positions within the right, and that these arguments are likely to shape future formations of right-wing and centrist policy. Douthat also warns that exacerbating the problem of polarization in American discourse by widening the range of permissible views on the left while banishing conventional, widely held conservative opinions is not an antidote for the polarization afflicting American discourse.",

Susan Bibeau, Zehaf-Bibeau's mother, wrote in an email to The Associated Press that she and her husband wanted to \"apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos\" their son created.\n\nAccording to the email, Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was \"lost and did not fit in.\" Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson stated during a briefing that while the full extent of Zehaf-Bibeau's motivation is not yet known, his actions were \"linked to his radicalization.\"\n\nAuthorities have not found evidence linking Zehaf-Bibeau to Martin Rouleau-Couture, the man who ran over two Canadian soldiers on Monday. Zehaf-Bibeau was not on the list of 90 or so Canadians that authorities are monitoring for national security reasons. However, his email address was found on the computer of a man who was arrested on a terrorism charge.\n\nPolice learned through their conversation with Zehaf-Bibeau's mother that he had intentions to travel to Syria. He had applied for a passport, and authorities were in the midst of investigating his application. Zehaf-Bibeau was a Canadian citizen and may have also held Libyan citizenship.\n\nZehaf-Bibeau had a criminal record in multiple provinces, according to NPR's Jackie Northam. He was described as a \"fairly recent convert to Islam\" and the son of a senior official of Canada's immigration department. The Globe and Mail reported that he was a laborer and small-time criminal who had a religious awakening and seemed to have become mentally unstable.\n\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was charged in 2004 with drug possession, pleaded guilty, and served 60 days in jail. He was also charged in 2011 with robbery and uttering threats in British Columbia and was sentenced to one day in jail with credit for 66 days already served.\n\nThe Ottawa police have ruled out the possibility of a second shooter in the incident. It is unclear whether the incident is tied to the incident on the previous day in which two soldiers were run down in a car, one killed and the other injured by someone described as having been radicalized by Islam.\n\nThis article is based on reports from The Associated Press, NPR, The Globe and Mail, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Johnson, however, stated that there is no \"credible, specific intelligence to that effect.\"\n\nJohnson emphasized the importance of responsible information sharing, stating, \"We should be responsible in what we decide to share with the American public, so that the public is informed.\" His comments followed a Homeland Security spokeswoman's labeling of Hunter's statement as \"categorically false.\"\n\nJohnson assured the public that they are vigilant in looking out for individuals of suspicion crossing the border, but there is no specific intelligence indicating ISIS is planning to enter the U.S. through the southern border. He used another acronym for ISIS, ISIL, in his statement.\n\nHunter's spokesman, Joe Kasper, confirmed that the congressman stands by his comments. Kasper stated, \"A high level source informed the congressman -- it was also said that DHS is actively discouraging any talk of IS on the border.\" He added, \"The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told.\"\n\nIn response to DHS's statement, Kasper suggested that there is a lack of coordination within the department, stating, \"It's been that way for a long time, and we do not expect that to change.\"",
    " Title: Clinton Foundation to Continue Accepting Foreign Donations During Hillary Clinton's Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Clinton Foundation, led by former President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and their daughter Chelsea, has announced that it will continue to accept donations from foreign governments during Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The decision, outlined in a policy summary to be released on Thursday, permits donations from six countries: Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe new policy allows these countries to donate to the foundation, which has received over $100 million in foreign government donations, while prohibiting other nations from making large donations. However, these prohibited nations would still be allowed to participate in the Clinton Global Initiative, a subsidiary of the foundation where companies, nonprofit groups, and government officials collaborate to address global issues.\n\nThe decision to continue accepting foreign donations during Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign raises questions about potential conflicts of interest. If Hillary Clinton is elected president, will she prioritize the best interests of the United States, or will she prioritize the interests of the Clinton Foundation? This question arises in light of Hillary Clinton's email scandal during her tenure as Secretary of State, where she used a personal email account on an unsecured server for all of her official State Department business, potentially evading congressional oversight and compromising national security.\n\nAdditionally, despite Hillary Clinton's reputation as an advocate for women's rights, she has accepted millions in donations to her Foundation from countries with limited women's rights, such as Saudi Arabia. This raises questions about her commitment to promoting women's rights globally."
