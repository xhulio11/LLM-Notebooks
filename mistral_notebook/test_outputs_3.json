    " Title: Colin Powell Slams Donald Trump as \"National Disgrace,\" Criticizes Benghazi Investigations in Leaked Emails\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of leaked emails, former Secretary of State Colin Powell has criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a \"national disgrace\" and a \"racist\" for his role in the \"birther\" movement, and has dismissed Trump's overtures to African-American voters. Powell also called the repeated investigations into the 2012 attack in Benghazi a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThe emails, first reported by Buzzfeed News, were obtained by the website DCLeaks.com, which a federal law official told NBC News is believed to have ties to Russian intelligence services.\n\nIn a June 17 email to a former aide, Powell called Trump a \"national disgrace\" and \"international pariah,\" saying the Republican presidential contender was \"in the process of destroying himself, no need for Dems to attack him.\"\n\nA subsequent email to the same former aide on Aug. 21 slammed Trump for spurring the \"racist\" so-called \"birther\" movement, the consistently debunked rumor that President Barack Obama was born in another country.\n\n\"Yup, the whole birther movement was racist,\" Powell wrote, according to Buzzfeed. \"That's what the 99% believe. When Trump couldn't keep that up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted that he was a Muslim.\"\n\nThere was no immediate response from the Trump campaign to the emails.\n\nIn another email the same day, Powell dismissed Trump's stated overtures to African-American voters. \"There is nothing he can say that will sway black voters so he might as well say it to white folks,\" Powell wrote.\n\n\"He takes us for idiots,\" Powell, who is black, said in the email. \"He can never overcome what he tried to do to Obama with his search for the birth certificate hoping to force Obama out of the Presidency. Or, demanding his school transcripts to see how he got into Harvard \u2014 (eg, affirmative action).\"\n\nPowell also criticized the repeated investigations into the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate and another facility in Libya that left four Americans dead, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens.\n\n\"Benghazi is a stupid witch hunt,\" Powell wrote in a Dec. 17 email to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\nLed mostly by Republicans, eight Congressional investigations have been launched into the 2012 attack.\n\nIn a 2015 email to Rice, Powell said: \"Basic fault falls on a courageous ambassador who thought Libyans now love me and I am ok in this very vulnerable place. But blame also rests on his leaders and supporters back here. Pat Kennedy, Intel community, DS and yes, HRC.\"\n\nThe revelations mark the latest in a string of headlines around Powell's email correspondence. His online activity has figured heavily in the controversy around Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.\n\nPowell expressed frustration about his name being linked to Clinton's email issues, writing in another leaked email: \"I have told Hilleary's [sic] minions repeatedly that they are making a mistake trying to drag me in, yet they still try.\"\n\nIn July of 2015, Powell complained to his broker at Merrill Lynch that questions raised about Clinton's email and speaking fees impacted his life \u2014 Powell said he had to disclose his past use of emails, and \"I had a gig cancelled because the client, a public university, caught hell from overpaying HRC.\"\n\n\"HRC is the gift that keeps on taking,\" Powell wrote in the July 1, 2015 email, according to the leaked documents.\n\nAnd Powell, not referring to Clinton by name, then went on to apparently describe her as having \"unbridled ambition, greedy, not transformational\" along with some colorful references to her husband's rumored philandering, rumors he attributed to the New York Post.\n\nWhile Powell has described himself as a lifelong Republican, he twice endorsed Obama \u2014 a Democrat \u2014 for president.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Concerns Rise over ObamaCare-Tied Medical Device Tax, Lawmakers Call for Delay\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare display of bipartisan agreement, Democratic and Republican lawmakers have united in expressing concerns over a looming tax on medical devices tied to the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare). The tax, set to take effect on January 1, has emerged as one of the most contentious provisions in the health care overhaul and is facing opposition from both sides of the aisle.\n\nStarting January 1, the Affordable Care Act imposes a 2.3 percent tax on medical devices with the aim of raising nearly $30 billion over the next decade. However, a group of U.S. senators this week revived concerns that the tax could negatively impact one of the few U.S. industries that enjoys a net trade surplus.\n\nIn a letter to Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and North Carolina Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, along with 16 other senators and senators-elect, expressed their concerns. They argued that the medical technology industry directly employs over 400,000 people in the United States and is responsible for a total of 2 million high-skilled manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe lawmakers urged Reid to support a delay in the implementation of the tax, warning of the potential business consequences. \"With this year quickly drawing to a close, the medical device industry has received little guidance about how to comply with the tax, causing significant uncertainty and confusion for businesses,\" they wrote.\n\nAs the year draws to a close and the fiscal crisis looms, it remains unclear whether any changes to the planned tax could be included as part of a broader deal to avert the fiscal crisis. The Republican-controlled House already voted to repeal the tax over the summer, but the Senate has yet to take it up.\n\nLast week, Republican Georgia Rep. Tom Price reiterated his call for the tax to be repealed, stating, \"Doing so is a place where Republicans and Democrats alike can find common ground in efforts to serve the American people.\"\n\nStephen J. Ubl, president of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, also expressed concerns this week, stating that the tax could cost thousands of jobs and is already causing companies to lay off workers and cut back on research and development.\n\nThe tax would target a broad range of devices, from X-ray machines to ultrasound equipment to pacemakers. Equipment makers argue that the tax, when calculated on gross sales, ends up being much higher than 2.3 percent. One industry spokesman with Indiana-based Cook Medical estimated earlier this year that the impact on actual earnings is more like 15 percent. Cook Medical earlier this year announced it was scrapping plans to open five new plants due to the tax.\n\nDozens of other CEOs have issued similar warnings, stating that the looming tax could put whole companies out of business. Despite these concerns, the administration has defended the provision. According to the Treasury Department, the medical device companies could potentially benefit from the law, as the millions of new health care customers insured as a result of the law would increase the demand for hospital equipment, in turn boosting medical device companies' profits.",
    " Title: An Analysis of President Trump's Criticism of the Media and the Role of Journalists in a Free Society\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent rally in Phoenix, President Donald Trump veered off his prepared remarks, launching into a 30-minute tirade against the media, a familiar target for the President. As I watched the event on television, I found myself reminded of a different character: Joe Pesci from the movie \"Goodfellas.\"\n\nWhile I am not equating Donald Trump with the gangster Pesci portrayed in the film, there are times when Trump's rhetoric sounds more like a wise guy from Queens than a dignified occupant of the Oval Office.\n\nAs a former journalist for CBS News for 28 years, I have witnessed liberal bias, elitism, and a few mistakes. However, I never saw anything resembling the \"fake news\" that the President is constantly decrying. I never saw any journalist fabricate stories out of thin air.\n\nDuring his Phoenix rant, Trump accused journalists of attributing stories to unnamed sources that do not exist. While there have been a few instances of journalists making up quotes from nonexistent sources, such incidents are extremely rare. To President Trump, \"fake news\" is simply news about him that he dislikes.\n\nIn early June, CNN reported, and later retracted, a story stating that former FBI Director James Comey would contradict President Trump's assertion that Comey had informed him three times that he was not under investigation. The story led to the resignation of three of CNN's top investigative reporters. While the story was not a fabrication, it was a significant error that tarnished CNN's reputation, particularly at a time when there was widespread mistrust in the media and President Trump was regularly attacking the press.\n\nThe President's criticism of the media is not without merit, as there have been instances of biased reporting. However, it is essential to acknowledge that for many reporters, their animosity towards this President influences their journalism. This bias can lead to mistakes, as evidenced by the CNN incident.\n\nJournalists, as a whole, are not known for introspection, preferring instead to circle the wagons when faced with criticism. As a result, they do not spend a lot of time examining their biases and how those biases affect the way they cover the news.\n\nIn a free country like ours, people need to have confidence in the press. They need to know that reporters are honest brokers of information, holding powerful people accountable and not settling scores. Shouting about \"fake news\" is no way to deal with a press that Donald Trump does not like. Proclaiming \"fake innocence\" is no way to deal with a president that reporters do not like.\n\nIt would be beneficial for both the President and the media to approach their roles with more objectivity and less antagonism. The media should strive to uphold the highest journalistic standards, while the President should refrain from delegitimizing the mainstream media and channeling Joe Pesci's \"Goodfellas\" persona when criticizing the press. In a free society, the press plays a crucial role in holding those in power accountable, and it is essential that they do so without bias or personal animosity.",
    " Title: U.S. Forces Korea Leads the Way in Combating Racism within the Military\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards addressing racial injustice and discrimination within the U.S. military, U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) has taken the lead in implementing reforms and aggressive initiatives to combat racism, setting a precedent unmatched by any other arm of the American military.\n\nUnder the command of Army Gen. Robert B. Abrams, USFK has allowed at least two major demonstrations on military bases, believed to be the only such events on American military installations worldwide. The command has also swiftly banned Confederate flags and regalia on military grounds in South Korea.\n\nIn addition to these actions, Gen. Abrams and other leaders in the theater have launched listening sessions, social media events, question-and-answer forums, and a host of other avenues to hear from service members, their families, and other stakeholders about their experiences with discrimination in the military.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Seoul's raising of a \"Black Lives Matter\" banner this month, which was later reversed due to criticism, underscores the swift action taken by American military and diplomatic personnel in South Korea on this thorny issue.\n\nThe U.S. military has historically been at the forefront of the struggle for equal rights, but Black military leaders have recently spoken openly about the challenges and barriers they have faced in their careers. The Pentagon has also acknowledged criticism from private groups and Capitol Hill about significant racial disparities in the military justice system.\n\nDavid Maxwell, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who served in the Army for three decades, including years of service in South Korea, attributes the swift action to Gen. Abrams' understanding of institutional racism and his decision to take action.\n\n\"My sense is that Gen. Abrams, like many military leaders, has an understanding of institutional racism and decided to take action,\" said Maxwell. \"It was a brilliant move to allow military personnel and their families to exercise their First Amendment rights and demonstrate on behalf of issues that directly affect them. It may cause partisan friction with some elements, but I think Gen. Abrams showed compassion for the issue and demonstrated leadership in recognizing that changes need to be made in society and in our military.\"\n\nSo far, there has been little public criticism of USFK's course of action. Instead, numerous specialists and retired military officials have praised Gen. Abrams for moving swiftly on an issue that the Pentagon as a whole, by its own admission, has often been slow to address.\n\nThe steps taken by USFK began shortly after the death of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis police custody last month. Since then, Gen. Abrams has issued guidance banning the Confederate flag, which he said \"has the power to inflame feelings of racial division\" and must be outlawed.\n\nThe Navy and Marine Corps have already taken similar steps, but Gen. Abrams' move drew attention because the Army has struggled to address its ties to the Confederacy. Army officials have said they are willing to consider changing the names of 10 Army bases named after Confederate generals and officials, but it remains unclear where that effort will go in the face of strong public opposition from President Trump.\n\nIn addition to allowing demonstrations, Gen. Abrams and other officials have led an aggressive social media campaign to combat racial discrimination. During a question-and-answer session on Facebook, Gen. Abrams said the racial tensions sweeping the U.S. have sparked serious conversations within the military. He said it's incumbent on leaders such as himself to guide the process.\n\n\"The topic of race has been considered too taboo to be discussed openly, and only a few have been willing to engage,\" he said. \"We can and must do better. We cannot sit by and hope that 'they' fix it. Things will not improve by themselves.... If you don't think there is a problem, you might be part of the problem. Have the courage to start the conversation.\"\n\nTop leaders at the Pentagon have also been outspoken. Defense Secretary Mark Esper launched a review panel this month to examine systemic racism and discrimination in the military and to recommend concrete changes within six months. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark A. Milley directed all service chiefs to stamp out racism, and he took the rare public step of apologizing for appearing with the president at a photo opportunity in downtown Washington in the midst of heated protests.\n\nEach military service chief has also issued strong statements on racial justice and, in some cases, directed internal investigations into promotion practices and other areas in which Blacks could face discrimination.\n\nAlthough each of those steps is important, specialists say lasting change must take root at lower levels of the military. Leadership from officials such as Gen. Abrams, they say, is crucial.\n\n\"He both says and does\u2014he actually means it,\" said retired Army Lt. Col. Daniel L. Davis, who served as U.S. adviser to the Second Republic of Korea Army. \"It sets a standard that we are all equal here. We all have to pull together, work together as a team. It has a suppressive effect on anybody who may harbor these racist tendencies.\"",
    " Title: Romney's Potential Dilemma: The Impact of the Affordable Care Act Ruling on the 2012 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Supreme Court prepares to rule on the constitutionality of President Barack Obama's health care law, one Republican, Mitt Romney, may find himself in a unique position. While many Republicans are advocating for the court to strike down the Affordable Care Act, Romney, who authored a state-level health care law similar to the federal one, might regret its demise.\n\nRepublican strategists are concerned that if the court invalidates the law, Romney could lose a key issue that has been helping him rally conservative voters. \"Clearly, the Supreme Court overturning Obamacare is the best thing for the country, but it's an open question what's better for November's election,\" said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.). If the law is upheld, he added, \"it might drive our people out to the polls.\"\n\nAs the justices prepare to rule this month, both parties are grappling with how to position their candidates following the decision. In private meetings last week, House Republican leaders began outlining a unified GOP response, regardless of the outcome. The White House, with both the president's political standing and his signature achievement at stake, is hoping for the law to be upheld in its entirety. However, Republicans argue that a severe blow to the law could energize Obama's base and dampen the enthusiasm of their own activists.\n\n\"Obamacare is the one permanent and potentially irreversible [effect] that Obama will have on the country, and if it is overturned, it makes the election, by default, less important,\" a conservative operative involved in the campaign told a news organization earlier this week. \"If the court overturns it, 10 million conservative activists suddenly breathe a great sigh of relief, and may not be quite as intensely active.\"\n\nThe CBS/New York Times poll released Thursday found that more than two-thirds of respondents believe the law should be struck down in whole or in part. The law's survival would provide Romney, who has campaigned to repeal the Affordable Care Act, with a clearer contrast with Obama on health care. \"As president, I will work from my first day in office to dismantle Barack Obama's federal health care takeover and replace it with real reform that strengthens our health care system and puts patients first,\" Romney said Thursday.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have been discussing the potential implications of the court's decision this week, with several lawmakers debating the political ramifications. \"I could argue it both ways, and I have argued it both ways,\" said Rep. Patrick Tiberi (R-Ohio). \"I could see the president, if the mandate is thrown out, using it to rev up his troops.\"",
    " Title: Network News Shows Adapt to Social Distancing Amid Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented move, network news personalities are adapting to the new normal of social distancing amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. This change is being seen across various cable news networks, with hosts and guests filming from different parts of the same studio or remote locations.\n\nOne of the top-rated morning shows, Fox & Friends, has seen a shift in its usual format. Co-hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, and Brian Kilmeade, who are known for their interactions on the \"curvy couch\" in their Manhattan studio, have started practicing social distancing. On Tuesday, only Doocy was seated on the couch, while his co-hosts were situated in different parts of the same studio, one level down.\n\nKilmeade explained, \"To be responsible, to show social distancing, all three of us are apart.\" Doocy added, \"We're doing exactly the same thing people all across America are trying to do, and that is: Stay away from each other, because you don't want to get infected, and you don't want to spread infections.\"\n\nSimilar changes have been observed on other shows. On MSNBC, Morning Joe personalities Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski, and Willie Geist beamed in from different locations on Tuesday. On CNN, New Day co-hosts Alisyn Camerota and John Berman sat at the same desk, but several feet apart, adhering to the recommended six feet of separation guideline.\n\nRepresentatives for Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN have confirmed that their on-air staffers are practicing social distancing. At MSNBC, guests who come to the network's 30 Rock headquarters in New York for on-camera appearances will do so from a \"separate location.\" On-air staffers who sit at the same desk will always be at least six feet apart.\n\nOn Monday, MSNBC anchor Joshua Johnson highlighted the distance between himself and the other people on his panel. \"You may have noticed if you've been watching these specials for the last few days that we've been all at this one table,\" he said. \"We're not doing that anymore.\"\n\nAcross the television news industry, shows have cut out live audiences. At least one prominent host, The View co-host Joy Behar, has taken a temporary leave from her perch out of concern about potentially contracting the illness.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Today show host Al Roker beamed in live from his kitchen after he and fellow host Craig Melvin went into self-quarantine after a staffer on the third hour of the show's franchise tested positive for the virus. \"I didn't have to commute in, so I did sleep in,\" he said.\n\nThese changes reflect the evolving landscape of news production in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, as network news outlets strive to maintain safety while continuing to deliver news to their audiences.",
    " Title: Speaker Paul D. Ryan Announces Retirement from Congress, Sparking Midterm Election Uncertainty\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan (R-WI) announced on Wednesday that he will be retiring from Congress at the end of this year, marking the culmination of a two-decade political career. The announcement has ignited a wave of speculation and soul-searching within the Republican Party, which is already bracing for a challenging midterm election season in November.\n\nRyan made the announcement to his colleagues during the weekly House GOP meeting and later confirmed it at a press conference in the morning. He cited his desire to spend more time with his family as the primary reason for his decision. \"If I am here for one more term, my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend dad. I just can't let that happen. So I will be setting new priorities in my life,\" Ryan said.\n\nDespite his departure from Congress, Ryan expressed his intention to remain active as a lame-duck speaker, stating, \"I'm not done yet. I intend to run through the tape.\" He also downplayed the political implications of his decision, asserting that the GOP has a strong record to run on and will likely hold the House in November.\n\nRumors of Ryan's departure had been circulating for months, and he and his aides had consistently denied them. Several lawmakers are now expected to compete for Ryan's position, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).\n\nRyan has served as speaker for a little over two years and has overseen a turbulent period, facing down conservative rebellions and securing a large tax cut, but failing to repeal Obamacare. His goal of rewriting the federal budget to bring more accountability to social spending programs has also faced opposition, even from within his own party.\n\nRyan has become a key ally of President Trump on Capitol Hill, helping to push the White House agenda. In response to Ryan's announcement, President Trump tweeted, \"Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!\"\n\nDemocrats expressed hope that Ryan, now free from having to face voters, would turn on President Trump and his colleagues. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) said, \"With his newfound political freedom, I hope the Speaker uses his remaining time in Congress to break free from the hard-right factions of his caucus that have kept Congress from getting real things done.\"\n\nHowever, Republicans downplayed the possibility of significant changes in Ryan's behavior and expressed support for him. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), who took over as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee after Ryan gave up the post to ascend to speaker, called the announcement a \"tough day\" for Republicans but added, \"I think the main reason for this is his family. He's never been a lifer.\"\n\nRyan faced a tougher-than-usual election fight back home in Wisconsin this year, with several Democrats vying to challenge him. Kyle Kondik, of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the announcement gives Democrats a much better shot of picking up the seat, which Ryan has held since 1999.\n\nRyan faced a challenge for the seat from Paul Nehlen, a man with white supremacist ties who the state party severed ties with in 2018. His Twitter account was also suspended for anti-Semitism. The retirement announcement comes as Ryan faced a tougher-than-usual election fight back home in Wisconsin this year, with several Democrats battling to face him, and raising plenty of cash from liberal activists who saw ousting Mr. Ryan as the best way to send a signal to President Trump.",
    " Title: Trump's Meeting with Evangelical Leaders: A Potential Tipping Point for Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK -- In a bid to secure the crucial evangelical voting bloc, Donald Trump held a meeting with hundreds of evangelical leaders in Times Square on Tuesday. With the evangelical vote being a significant factor in his bid for the presidency, the meeting seemed to help Trump's case.\n\nFrom mega-church pastors to longtime stalwarts, the leaders heard Trump speak about defending religious liberty, including his desire to repeal IRS restrictions that limit political talk from the pulpit. Trump stated that a repeal may be \"my biggest contribution to Christianity.\"\n\nIn the room, among the 900 or so evangelical leaders, there were quite a few who were not for Trump going into the meeting. However, after the meeting, some minds seemed to change.\n\n\"The ball has moved forward a little bit. And I appreciate Mr. Trump's willingness to reach out to the evangelical community,\" said Matt Barber, founder and editor-in-chief of BarbWire.com.\n\n\"After hearing him today, I will prayerfully consider it as a possibility, in light of the alternative,\" reflected Barber.\n\nThe alternative being Hillary Clinton, Trump made clear his Supreme Court picks would make them proud, unlike what Clinton might bring to the table.\n\nTrump also talked about how evangelicals need to band together because their rights and values are under attack. What pleased some attendees was that Trump did not appear to make any major mistakes or give reason for pause.\n\n\"I can't remember any time during the several hours this morning that his answer disappointed or that there was chagrin about it,\" recalled Gary Bauer, president of American Values.\n\n\"He did something that most Republican nominees in the past have refused to do and that's walk into this room and be willing to sit down, take their questions and really interact with them in a very big way,\" Huckabee told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News.\n\nWith some evangelicals still wary, the brash outsider will need more outreach, but for now at least, it seems to be working.\n\n\"As it pertains to the evangelical vote and the candidacy of Donald J. Trump, today's meeting may very well be a tipping point,\" predicted Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.\n\nA pro-family leader, Rodriguez says he knew plenty of pastors who were skeptical before the meeting, but inside, something changed, he said.\n\n\"After hearing his commitment, his very well-defined, articulated commitment to religious liberty and life, the Supreme Court especially, I think you saw a number of the same pastors walk out going, 'that's what I needed to hear',\" Rodriguez said.\n\nAnd that's something the Trump campaign needed to hear after a rough few weeks of headlines. It will be important for them to build on any progress here by getting evangelicals to move beyond words and work actively for Trump among their flocks.\n\nTrump also announced he's forming an Evangelical Executive Advisory Board.",
    " Title: Ann Romney's Prime-Time Speech at GOP Convention Humanizes Mitt Romney and Highlights Struggles\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a poignant and personal address at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday, Ann Romney, the wife of Mitt Romney, shared her family's struggles with cancer, multiple sclerosis, and the challenges of raising five children. The speech, which was intended to humanize Mitt Romney, served to humanize Ann Romney herself, offering a glimpse into her life and experiences.\n\nAnn Romney, who is known for her attractiveness and polished image, used her speech to convey a sense of familiarity with struggle and a connection with women, particularly mothers, who have faced similar trials. She spoke of the exhaustion, health issues, and the juggling act of raising children and managing a home while her husband pursued his education and career.\n\nBarbara Bair, a delegate from York, Pennsylvania, expressed her appreciation for Ann Romney's speech, stating, \"I was so glad she had this opportunity to talk to the women of America, to have them hear about the trials they went through. And to hear that her husband is a man that stands behind her, supporting her through breast cancer. There is nothing scarier for families than cancer.\"\n\nThe speech was seen as a necessary step to humanize Mitt Romney, but it primarily served to humanize Ann Romney and, by extension, her husband. The aim is to make Mitt Romney more appealing to women who may have been wary of the Republican Party's positions on reproductive and workplace rights.\n\nKitty Dunn, a 65-year-old delegate from Utah who has met the Romneys, commented, \"She may have privilege, but she understands.\"\n\nWhile Ann Romney's speech began with a focus on love, it transitioned into a more robust defense of her husband, his unheralded good works, and his business success. She challenged the notion of fearing success and defended Bain Capital, the company Mitt Romney co-founded, as a dream launcher that has helped many others lead better lives.\n\nAnn Romney's energetic and personal account of marriage, family, and love resonated with many, including Greg Treat, a 34-year-old delegate and state senator from Oklahoma. Treat said, \"I think Ann Romney will make a difference. Michelle Obama is a huge positive for the president, and Mrs. Romney will be for her husband as well.\"\n\nAnn Romney's speech was a powerful and personal testament to her experiences and her love for her family, offering a humanizing perspective on the Romney family and their journey.",
    " Title: Google Bans Far-Right Websites ZeroHedge and The Federalist from Ad Platform Over Policy Violations\n\nGoogle has taken action against two far-right websites, ZeroHedge and The Federalist, for violating its policies on content related to race. The tech giant has banned the websites from its advertising platform, citing derogatory content that promotes hatred, intolerance, violence, or discrimination based on race.\n\nGoogle notified ZeroHedge of the policy violations last week and banned the website from its ad platform. The company issued a warning to The Federalist on Tuesday over comments on articles related to recent protests. After publication of this story, Google backtracked Tuesday, clarifying that The Federalist had been warned about policy violations but still had time to address them. As of Wednesday morning, The Federalist had removed the comments that violated Google's policies, and Google stated it would take no further action.\n\nThe decision comes after Google was notified of research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a British nonprofit that combats online hate and misinformation. The research found that 10 U.S.-based websites, including ZeroHedge and The Federalist, had published what the center says are racist articles about the recent Black Lives Matter protests. The center also found advertisements for many companies that had otherwise made public statements supporting Black Lives Matter and the recent protests running on the websites.\n\nImran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said the center found content on the websites that was outright racist in defense of white supremacism and contained conspiracy theories about George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nGoogle has banned various websites from its advertising platform in recent years, mostly targeting fake news operations. ZeroHedge and The Federalist have become well known in recent years for publishing far-right articles on a variety of subjects. On the recent protests, ZeroHedge published an article claiming that protests were fake, while The Federalist published an article claiming the media had been lying about looting and violence during the protests.\n\nAs the Black Lives Matter protests unfolded over recent weeks, hundreds of corporations eagerly lent their support. This includes Google, which said it has donated $12 million in funding to organizations working to address racial inequities. However, there are other similar websites that continue to generate revenue through Google, causing continued concern for civil rights advocates. In its research, the Center for Countering Digital Hate pointed to examples of articles on other far-right websites that carried advertisements by well-known brands while disseminating false narratives about the protest movement.\n\nCaroline McCarthy, vice president of communications and content at TrueX, a digital advertising company, said companies need to hold Google and other digital advertising companies responsible for where their ads run. \"The reality is that they [brands] have to start by asking questions,\" McCarthy said. \"They have to say, what is my brand content going to be running against? And if the other person on the other side of the conversation can't give them a straight answer, then that's a problem.\"\n\n\"The pressure on the tech companies is only going to come from dollars actually, literally getting pulled,\" she added.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush's Use of 'Anchor Babies' Term Sparks Controversy Among Latinos\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent exchange with reporters in New Hampshire, former Governor Jeb Bush found himself in the midst of controversy after using the term \"anchor babies\" to refer to the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants. During the testy exchange, Bush stated that he does not consider the term offensive and attributed the notion that it is an insult to Democrats.\n\n\"Do you have a better term?\" Bush asked one reporter. \"You give me a better term and I'll use it.\"\n\nHowever, Raul A. Reyes, an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors, argues that the term \"anchor baby\" is a derogatory slur. Reyes, who is active on Twitter (@RaulAReyes), asserts that the term is not only offensive but also inaccurate.\n\nThe term \"anchor baby\" is based on the assumption that having an American-born child can protect undocumented individuals from deportation. The child, according to this line of thought, \"anchors\" a family in the United States and allows them to gain citizenship.\n\nHowever, having a citizen child does not provide any protection from potential deportation. For instance, in the first six months of 2011, parents with U.S.-citizen children accounted for 22% of deportees. Between 2010 and 2012, the United States deported nearly 205,000 parents of citizen kids. In 2013, over 72,000 were deported, according to The Huffington Post. President Barack Obama's executive action plan, currently tied up in the courts, would grant temporary deportation relief to parents of children who meet certain requirements.\n\nAnother misconception surrounding \"anchor babies\" is that people from foreign countries are rushing to the United States to have children. While there has been a phenomenon known as \"birth tourism\" among Asian mothers who temporarily relocate to the United States to have a child, their numbers are statistically small. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 7,955 children were born to foreign residents in 2012. Research has shown that the overwhelming majority of undocumented immigrants come to the United States to work.\n\nReyes' commentary underscores the need for careful and accurate language when discussing sensitive and complex issues such as immigration. The term \"anchor babies\" is not only offensive but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes and misconceptions about undocumented immigrants and their children.

    " Title: Google's Dismissal of Memo Author Sparks Debate on Free Speech and Diversity in Silicon Valley\n\nArticle:\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - A heated debate on free speech and diversity in the tech industry has intensified following Google's dismissal of software engineer James Damore, who authored a controversial memo questioning the company's commitment to hiring women.\n\nDamore, who was terminated by Alphabet Inc's Google on Monday, confirmed his dismissal after writing a 10-page memo that suggested the company was hostile to conservative viewpoints and that women, on average, have more neuroticism.\n\nThe memo, which argued that men may be biologically more suited to coding jobs than women, sparked a wave of criticism from many in Silicon Valley, who found the views offensive and destructive. However, the memo was also embraced by some, particularly on the political right, who hailed Damore as a brave truth-teller.\n\nThe incident echoes past examples of the wide gulf between U.S. conservative activists and the tech sector. In 2014, Brendan Eich was forced out as Mozilla's chief executive after his opposition to gay marriage became public. Most technology executives held the opposite view, and tech companies often gave benefits to same-sex couples well before gay marriage was legalized.\n\nAndrew Torba, chief executive of the social network Gab, which is popular among conservatives, offered Damore a job, stating in an interview that \"censorship is for losers.\" WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange, whose group released hacked emails that helped the campaign of Republican U.S. President Donald Trump, also offered Damore a job on Twitter.\n\nAaron Ginn, co-founder of the Lincoln Network, a group of libertarian-leaning tech workers and investors, said Google should have put Damore through training instead of firing him. \"You're going to make him a martyr. In this hyper-tribal political day we are in, I think you'd want to try to avoid making him a martyr,\" Ginn said.\n\nRecent political feelings have divided two board members of Facebook Inc, according to a report by the New York Times. Last August, Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix Inc, warned investor Peter Thiel in an email that Thiel's support for Trump showed \"catastrophically bad judgment.\" The outcome of that dispute is not known. Hastings and Thiel remain on Facebook's board.\n\nSilicon Valley tech companies have been under mounting criticism for not doing enough to promote gender equality and stamp out sexual harassment. Claims of persistent sexual harassment in the ranks of Uber Technologies Inc and of several venture capital firms have led to management shake-ups. The U.S. Labor Department is investigating Google to see whether the firm has unlawfully paid women less than men. Google denies that it does.\n\nGoogle, which has used the motto \"Don't be evil,\" received accolades from many quarters for treating Damore's memo as a threat to its corporate culture. However, critics argue that the memo's content is toxic to the tech community and categorizes women as weak or incompetent.\n\nJosh Reeves, chief executive at Gusto, a software company, said he expected the topic would come up at its all-staff meeting on Wednesday. Gusto's code of conduct \"specifically prohibits a memo like Damore's,\" Reeves said, if the memo would be offensive to individuals in a protected group.\n\nDamore, who could not be reached for comment on Tuesday, said in an email to \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Monday that he was exploring a possible legal challenge to his dismissal. His case would likely be weak, employment lawyers said, and some lawyers said Google could have faced lawsuits if it had not acted against him. Google said it could not talk about individual employee cases.\n\nU.S. companies have broad latitude to restrict the speech of employees in private workplaces, where First Amendment protections against government censorship do not apply. Damore's title at Google was software engineer, and he had worked at the company since December 2013, according to a profile on LinkedIn. The LinkedIn page also says Damore received a Master's degree in systems biology from Harvard University in 2013. Harvard said on Tuesday he completed a master's degree in the subject, not a PhD.\n\nIndustry experts note that in the early days of tech, it was mostly women who held the then-unglamorous jobs of coding. However, as the value of top-notch programming became clear, men came to dominate the field.\n\nOther tech companies on Tuesday were closely watching the controversy at Google unfold, and grateful they were not the ones caught in another debate over gender and diversity. \"Every large organization has a James Damore - but at tech companies, they're more liberated to share their personal views,\" an executive at one major Silicon Valley firm said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"Tech firms have an abundance of smart, confident people who think they have an obligation to share their wisdom with their coworkers.\"",
    " Title: \"Democratic Loss in North Carolina's 9th District Highlights Shift in Minority Voting Patterns\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recently concluded special election for North Carolina's 9th District, Republican Dan Bishop narrowly defeated Democrat Dan McCready, a race that was initially considered a safe GOP seat. However, the focus has shifted from Bishop's thin margin of victory to the voting patterns that could potentially worry the Democrats.\n\nThe most concerning trend for the Democrats is the significant drop in votes for McCready in ethnically diverse counties, particularly in Robeson County. This county, with a diverse demographic makeup of 38.6% Native American, 24% Black, 25.7% White, 8.52% Hispanic, 2.15% Two or More Races, 0.66% Asian, and 0.275% Other, saw a significant shift away from McCready in Tuesday's election. In 2018, McCready won Robeson County by 15.31 points, but on Tuesday, he won by only 1.11 points, a significant decrease. In 2012, President Obama carried Robeson by 17 points.\n\nRobeson County, with approximately 143,000 residents, is not the stereotypical rural area dominated by racist rednecks, as the Democrats might portray. Instead, 74% of its residents are not white. The shift away from McCready was due to disenchantment among minority voters with the Democrat.\n\nSimilar trends were observed in other ethnically diverse counties, such as Cumberland County, where nearly 60% of its approximately 333,000 residents are Black, Hispanic, or a member of some other minority group. McCready won Cumberland County in 2018, but Dan Bishop won it in Tuesday's election.\n\nThe same scenario played out in most counties, except for the affluent white areas of Mecklenburg County, the only place where the Democrat improved on his 2018 performance. Bishop only flipped two new counties from blue to red, but he turned several from dark blue to pale blue, reducing McCready's margins in enough ethnically diverse rural counties to win.\n\nThe reasons for this shift are clear. Despite the Democrats' attempts to scare minorities with evidence-free claims that the economy is faltering, the majority of Blacks (53%) and Hispanics (54%) answered that the U.S. economy is strong. These are far higher marks than any GOP president has received, particularly from Blacks.\n\nThe unemployment rate among Blacks hit 5.5% in August, the lowest rate on record. Breitbart points out a secondary effect of this record-low unemployment rate often overlooked by the media: the persistent gap between white and black unemployment also narrowed to its smallest on record. This decline in employment inequality is the best on record because it comes in the context of falling unemployment.\n\nPresident Trump acknowledged the positive economic impact of his policies during his North Carolina rally on Monday, emphasizing the creation of jobs and the improvement in the economy. He also criticized McCready for supporting Nancy Pelosi on higher taxes, sanctuary cities, and radical abortion policies.\n\nIn his victory speech, Bishop thanked the President and expressed his support for the President's values. He stated, \"Let's all say a prayer for [the President] because that's what we do. We pray. I hear your values. I'm not ashamed of those values. I will defend those in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nThe voters who elected Dan Bishop to the House of Representatives are not racist rednecks or people who wallow in \"white privilege.\" They are the people who work for a living in places like Cumberland, Richmond, and Robeson counties. They are not all white, and they remember all too well what it was like during the Obama years and how it felt to go hat in hand to the unemployment office. This should worry the Democrats significantly.",
    " Title: New Charges Against Paul Manafort and Associate Konstantin Kilimnik in Mueller Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his longtime associate Konstantin Kilimnik have been indicted on additional charges. The new charges, known as a superseding indictment, allege that the two men conspired to obstruct justice and sought to tamper with witnesses ahead of Manafort's trial next month.\n\nThe charges, filed in Washington DC on Friday, come days after Mueller asked a judge to revoke Manafort's $10 million bail, which has allowed him to remain under house arrest at his Virginia home, over the witness-tampering accusations. Kilimnik, a Russian citizen and Manafort's right-hand man in Ukraine, is accused of conspiring with Manafort to obstruct justice.\n\nKilimnik, who was a longtime employee of Manafort's political-consulting firm, had done extensive lobbying work for him in Ukraine on behalf of the country's then pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. He has denied allegations that he has ties to Russian intelligence.\n\nThe legal pressure on Paul Manafort is growing, and now one of his top deputies is joining him in the prosecutorial crosshairs. For the moment, Manafort is one of the few targets of Mueller's Russia probe to push toward a criminal trial, rather than cooperate with the investigation. The special counsel's team may be hoping the prospect of pre-trial incarceration could help change Manafort's mind.\n\nPerhaps more important is that an alleged line from the Russian government to the Trump campaign could be getting clearer. Kilimnik, a Soviet-born former translator from Ukraine, is reported to be the \"Person A\" described in a previous Mueller court filing as having \"ties to a Russian intelligence service\" up to and including in 2016, when his boss, Manafort, worked as the chair of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nMueller has yet to assert that Manafort's Ukraine and Russian connections resulted in any election-meddling. However, the skeleton for future allegations can now be discerned. Kilimnik appears unlikely to face these new charges in court, as his whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nMueller is investigating whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election. Mueller was appointed after US President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey last May.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mueller asked that Manafort be detained in jail, claiming that he had been using encrypted communication to try to coach two potential witnesses' testimonies. On Friday, Trump denied that he was considering pardoning Manafort. \"It's far too early to be thinking about it,\" Trump told reporters before traveling to the G7 summit in Canada. \"They have not been convicted of anything. There's nothing to pardon.\"",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Face Challenges in Criticizing Obama's Legacy\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Democratic primary race heats up, presidential hopefuls are finding themselves in a delicate position when it comes to criticizing the Obama administration. While the Democratic base still holds a deep respect for President Barack Obama, some early state voters feel that his administration failed to deliver on many of his promises, leaving the political landscape largely unchanged a decade after his presidency.\n\n\"We saw what happened with Obama. There's no change yet,\" said Derryl Mitchell II, a 27-year-old Democratic voter and media marketing firm owner in Charleston, South Carolina. \"We had a chance in 2008 and not much came from it. We're still here\u2014same issues.\"\n\nJoseph R. Biden, who is running on a platform of restoring Obama-era values and stability to the country, currently holds a commanding lead in the crowded primary race. He has kept his political attacks focused on President Trump, while his nearly two dozen rivals have largely held their fire on the former vice president.\n\nHowever, this is expected to change at the first Democratic presidential primary debate next week in Miami, where Biden will be a prime target. The challenge will be to criticize the Obama administration's record without directly attacking Obama himself.\n\n\"I actually think there is probably a good bit of room to go after Obama policies without mentioning Obama by name,\" said Brent Nelsen, a political science professor at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. \"There is still an afterglow from the Obama presidency and I would say most candidates aren't going to go out and criticize Barack Obama personally or the administration directly, but you already hear them taking on things like health care.\"\n\nIndeed, liberal activists have argued that Obama's signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act, didn't go far enough and that his administration's record on immigration was poor. Biden is also vulnerable to criticism for championing policies that didn't receive significant push from the Obama White House, such as a $15 minimum wage or free tuition at community colleges.\n\nRepublican strategist and pollster John Couvillon said Biden is vulnerable on the Obama front and will eventually be hit there. \"With President Obama fading further and further into the rearview mirror, those aspects of President Obama's record could be challenged by competitors,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking at a fundraiser in New York on Tuesday, Biden acknowledged the target on his back. \"There's a target on my back,\" he said.\n\nSome candidates have tiptoed around criticism of the Obama legacy. Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke told MSNBC last week that Biden represents a return to the past. \"You can not go back to the end of the Obama administration and think that that's good enough,\" he said. \"We can not return to the past.\"\n\nHowever, when pressed to explain his comment, O'Rourke tried to thread the needle, praising Obama as the \"greatest president of my lifetime\" while reiterating his argument that it is time for a new generation of leadership.\n\nThe Democratic hopefuls are understandably skittish about criticizing Obama. Last year, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont dared to question the accomplishments of Obama. \"The business model, if you like, of the Democratic Party for the last 15 years or so has been a failure,\" he said at an event in Jackson, Mississippi. \"People sometimes don't see that because there was a charismatic individual named Barack Obama. He was obviously an extraordinary candidate, brilliant guy. But beyond that reality, over the last 10 years, Democrats have lost about 1,000 seats in state legislatures all across this country.\"\n\nThe retribution by Democratic Party faithful was swift and severe. Sanders was even called \"deplorable.\"\n\nSteffen Schmidt, a political science professor at Iowa State University, suggested Biden's rivals focus on what they consider blemishes from Biden's three-plus decades representing Delaware in the Senate. \"Obama went out of two terms with high approval especially among Democrats, so the candidates will need to stick with age, support for tough police action against gangs, his original position on abortion, and other issues Democrats hold against him,\" he said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Biden gets lots of mileage out of his Obama ties. During a campaign swing through Iowa last week, Biden touted the role the administration played in passing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in response to the 2008 recession, which he credited with stopping the country from slipping into an economic depression. \"As a point of personal privilege, I want to say something we don't say often enough to our party and to our nation: Barack Obama was a president of extraordinary character and decency,\" he said in Davenport, eliciting his biggest applause of the evening.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Signals Closer Approach to Iran Deal, Midterm Elections Loom as Key Factor\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama's political team is reportedly nearing a deal with Iran, a development that has sparked concerns among negotiators about the potential reception in the U.S. Congress and the American public. The ongoing negotiations between the Islamic Republic and the Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany, are being closely watched, with the Obama administration working to avoid scrutiny from the Senate.\n\nAccording to a senior White House official, the administration does not plan to seek congressional legislation for years in any comprehensive agreement. This approach has been met with criticism, as some argue that a Republican-controlled Senate could potentially block President Obama from implementing a deal perceived as weak or dangerous.\n\nThe Democrats controlling the Senate have been largely silent on the issue, a stark contrast to their usual vocal opposition on other foreign policy matters. This silence has raised concerns among some observers, who question the Senate's willingness to challenge the president on the Iran deal.\n\nThe Obama administration has reportedly excluded State Department career foreign service officials from the real negotiation process, with political appointees working with Secretary of State John Kerry outmaneuvering any dissenting expert voices.\n\nUndersecretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, who is leading the Iran negotiations, has a history of controversial negotiations, having previously led the unsuccessful attempts to end North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Critics argue that Sherman was duped by North Korean officials during those negotiations.\n\nIn the more than five rounds of talks between the Permanent 5 members of the UN Security Council plus Germany and Iran, Sherman has reportedly ignored signs that the Iranians are not serious about making concessions. The proposed deal from the Obama administration is weaker than the UN's previous 5 resolutions demanding Iran stop enriching all uranium.\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, pro-Israel voters, including evangelical Christians and Jewish voters in key states such as North Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire, Colorado, Arkansas, Alaska, and Louisiana, are being urged to vote in order to potentially flip the Senate to Republican control and prevent a disastrous Iran deal. Eastern European Americans concerned about the rise of Russia and the weak American response in Ukraine are also being encouraged to vote for the president's opposition in the Senate.\n\nIf Iran secures the pending Obama deal, the risk of a nuclear weapon for the Islamic Republic increases significantly. The midterm elections may be the last chance to prevent this calamitous outcome. Richard Grenell, a former spokesman for four United States Ambassadors to the United Nations, including Ambassador Zal Khalilzad, has made these concerns known.",
    " Title: Republicans' Tax Bill: Key Details, Controversies, and Next Steps\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Republican party unveiled their final tax bill on Friday, moving a step closer to a vote next week and potentially signing it into law by the end of the year. The bill, a long-awaited campaign promise, is expected to ease the tax burden of businesses and individuals, with critics arguing that it is weighted more towards businesses than the middle class.\n\nThe bill, which has been the subject of months of negotiations in both chambers, reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, nearly doubles the standard deduction for individuals, and restructures the way pass-through businesses are taxed. The bill retains seven personal income tax brackets, with lower tax rates for most brackets, including a drop in the top rate to 37% from 39.6%. The child tax credit under the bill will be $2,000, and the credit is refundable up to $1,400.\n\nThe bill also makes concessions to win over Republicans from high-tax states like New Jersey, New York, and California, allowing individuals to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local taxes. The conference report, however, does not include specific details on how the plan is funded. The bill leaves the student loan interest deduction untouched and lowers the mortgage interest deduction cap.\n\nUnlike previous versions of the bill, the conference committee version leaves the estate tax intact, doubling the estate tax exemption instead of repealing it. The bill also repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax and makes changes to the individual alternative minimum tax.\n\nRepublican leaders are optimistic about their ability to pass the legislation next week, with House Ways and Means Chairman Rep. Kevin Brady stating, \"I'm confident at the end of the day, the Senate will approve this conference committee report.\" Key holdouts in the Senate, where Republicans have a slim two-vote majority, have signaled their support for the bill, with Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Bob Corker, who initially voted against the GOP tax plan, expressing their support.\n\nOne of the key items Republicans have had to keep a close eye on is how much their bill costs. Under the Senate rules, the bill can not cost more than $1.5 trillion over 10 years and it can not add to the deficit after that. The bill sunsets the individual tax breaks at the end of 2025 and repeals the individual mandate to help finance the bill.\n\nThe bill's release has updated the ongoing debate, with more developments expected in the coming days. The bill's impact on the economy, middle class, and deficit will be closely watched as it moves through the legislative process.",
    " Title: Key Tax Reform Issues Remain Unresolved as Republicans Seek Permanent, Revenue-Neutral Tax Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Trump administration and congressional Republicans work towards unifying around a single tax-reform bill, aiming to pass the legislation this year, key differences between the priorities of the White House, the House, and the Senate remain. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) have stated that Republicans agree on about 80 percent of a tax reform package. However, working through that final 20 percent could take some time.\n\nHere are five tax reform issues that Republicans need to resolve:\n\n1. Permanent vs. Temporary Tax Changes: House GOP leaders are pushing for the changes to be permanent, but some senators and administration officials have expressed openness to temporary tax changes. If Republicans want to pass a tax-reform bill under \"reconciliation\" to bypass a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, the legislation can't increase the deficit outside of the budget window. As a result, a tax bill either needs to be revenue-neutral or make the tax cuts on a temporary basis.\n\n2. Tax Rate Differences: Republicans agree that they want to lower tax rates, but tax plans put forward by House Republicans and the White House diverge on how low to set tax rates for both individuals and businesses.\n\n3. Border-Adjustment Tax (BAT): The biggest fight over tax reform so far this year has centered on the House GOP's BAT proposal. Under the proposal, imports would be subject to a 20% tax that wouldn't apply to exports. However, the proposal's fate doesn't look good, as GOP senators, administration officials, and even some House Republicans have expressed concerns about its impact on consumers.\n\n4. Business Investment: The plan would eliminate the deduction for businesses' net interest expenses, instead allowing companies to immediately write off the full costs of their investments. However, the interest deduction has its defenders, who say that debt financing is important to industries such as real estate, private equity, telecommunications, and agriculture.\n\n5. Infrastructure: The tax plans from House Republicans and the White House do not include infrastructure. However, linking taxes and transportation may not be off the table, as Trump and some lawmakers have floated the idea.\n\nAs the tax reform process moves forward, it remains to be seen how these issues will be resolved and whether a unified tax-reform bill can be passed this year.",
    " Title: \"Sanders Sues DNC, Alleges Data Access Suspension as Undermining Campaign Efforts\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has filed a lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Friday, alleging that the party's decision to suspend his access to the voter files is an attempt to undermine his campaign and aid his competitor, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe lawsuit marks the latest development in a growing controversy that has cast a shadow over both the DNC and Sanders' campaign. The DNC has accused Sanders of playing dirty by illicitly accessing Clinton's campaign files, while Sanders claims the DNC is trying to sabotage his campaign to help Clinton.\n\nClinton, for her part, has remained silent on the matter, with her campaign manager, Robby Mook, stating flatly that Sanders' staff \"stole data from our campaign\" and insisting on an outside monitor to ensure all of the data has been expunged.\n\nThe DNC suspended Sanders' access to its voter data file, which contains detailed demographic, voting history, and personal information of tens of millions of Americans. The DNC stated that a contractor running the data file detected two dozen breaches where Sanders employees accessed Clinton data and even attempted to download it.\n\nSanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, has admitted that one staffer has been fired and others are being questioned for acting \"irresponsibly.\" However, the campaign also argues that the DNC had no legal right to suspend its access, and claims that Democratic Party leaders are trying to aid Clinton's campaign.\n\n\"By their action, the leadership of the Democratic National Committee is now actively attempting to undermine our campaign,\" Mr. Weaver said. \"This is unacceptable. Individual leaders of the DNC can support Hillary Clinton in any way they want, but they are not going to sabotage our campaign \u2014 one of the strongest grassroots campaigns in modern history.\"\n\nDNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, speaking on CNN, defended the decision to suspend Sanders' access, stating that it was the only fair move because he broke the terms of the access agreement.\n\nThe legal battle comes a day before the third Democratic presidential debate, where Sanders, Clinton, and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley are scheduled to face off. Clinton maintains a wide lead in national polls and is ahead in Iowa, but Sanders leads in polling in New Hampshire.\n\nThe controversy over the voter files is not the first time Democrats have faced computer-related problems this year. Clinton's push for the White House was dented after it was revealed she rejected use of an official email account during her tenure at the State Department, instead using an account on a server she kept at her home in New York. The arrangement went against department policy, and the emails are now being released on a rolling monthly basis in accordance with a federal court order.\n\nIn that situation, it was Republicans demanding Clinton submit her server to an independent monitor \u2014 a demand she rejected. Clinton eventually had to turn the server over to the FBI, which is investigating the arrangement.\n\nClinton spokesman Brian Fallon stated on Friday that the Sanders' breach of voter files was not an accident, and Sanders staffers not only looked at the data but at one point tried \u2014 apparently unsuccessfully \u2014 to download data into a spreadsheet for storage and use later.\n\nSanders is paying $10,000 a month for access to the files, but in his court documents he said losing access to the files and his campaign's work on them is costing his operation more than $600,000 a day in value because he cannot access mailing lists he's used to raise money.",
    " Title: White House Signs Bipartisan TRACED Act to Combat Unwanted Robocalls\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards consumer protection, President Donald J. Trump signed the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act into law on Monday. This legislation aims to prevent criminal robocalls, providing American consumers with enhanced protection against unwanted automated calls.\n\nThe TRACED Act updates existing laws and regulations, strengthening penalties, increasing transparency, and fostering government collaboration to combat unwanted solicitation. The White House stated that the President is proud to have collaborated with Congress to pass this bipartisan legislation.\n\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, a robocall attempting to sell a product or service is illegal unless a company has the consumer's written permission. The TRACED Act takes several crucial steps in the fight against illegal robocalls, marking a significant legislative effort that is not only bipartisan but also nearly unanimously supported in Congress.\n\nThe bill requires phone carriers to authenticate the legitimacy of calls, blocking unverified robocalls at no cost to consumers. Senator Thune, who played a key role in the legislation, is thanked for his unwavering partnership on this consumer protection issue. The hope is that the President will quickly sign this bill into law, allowing families to enjoy a new year free of robocalls.",
    " Title: Biden, Buttigieg Warn of Challenges for Democratic Socialist Nominee in Presidential Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview on ABC News' \"This Week,\" former Vice President Joe Biden and presidential contender Pete Buttigieg expressed concerns about the potential impact of a democratic socialist nominee on the Democratic Party and the country as a whole.\n\nBiden cautioned that nominating a democratic socialist candidate, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), could make it more difficult for Democrats to win not just the presidency but also down-ballot elections. He stated, \"Bernie calls himself a Democratic socialist. You're going to win with that label? You're going to help somebody in Florida win? With the label democratic socialist? Cause it's going to go all the way down the line.\"\n\nBiden further suggested that voters in Mid-Western and Southern states might be less willing to support Democratic candidates if the presidential nominee supports democratic socialistic policies. However, he pledged to \"work like hell\" to help Sanders win the election if he secured the nomination.\n\nPresidential hopeful Buttigieg also voiced his apprehensions, stating that a democratic socialist nominee could make it more challenging to win the election. He added, \"I think it will be a lot harder.\" Buttigieg also expressed concern about the potential for further dividing the country, stating, \"When the campaign says that either you're for a revolution or you must be for the status quo\u2014most of us don't see where we fit in that picture.\"\n\nBiden and Buttigieg's comments come after a disappointing fourth-place finish for Biden in the Iowa Caucus, with Sanders emerging as the frontrunner. Biden accused President Donald Trump of being \"desperate\" to pin the democratic socialist label on all Democratic candidates to use as a foil, and nominating Sanders could aid Trump in this effort.",
    " Title: Dan Coats Steps Down as US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe Nominated as Successor\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, President Donald Trump announced that Dan Coats, the current Director of National Intelligence, will step down in mid-August. Trump also revealed his intention to nominate John Ratcliffe, a Republican congressman from Texas, to replace Coats.\n\nCoats and Trump have had differing views on several key foreign policy issues, including Russia, North Korea, and the Iran nuclear deal. As Director of National Intelligence, Coats' role was to oversee all 17 US intelligence agencies, including the CIA and NSA. However, throughout his tenure, Coats' assessments were often contradicted by the president, who has been critical of intelligence agencies.\n\nIn January, the president called his intelligence chiefs \"passive and naive\" in their assessment of the threat posed by Iran. Coats is the latest in a string of Trump administration officials to leave the White House, with former Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson among them.\n\nIn his resignation letter to the president, Coats said America's intelligence community had become \"stronger than ever\" during his two-and-a-half-year tenure. \"As a result, I now believe it is time for me to move on to the next chapter of my life,\" he wrote.\n\nCoats and Trump's differences on foreign policy became particularly evident on issues such as Russian interference in US elections, the Iran nuclear deal, and Trump's attempts at rapprochement with North Korea. Citing a former senior intelligence official, the Washington Post reported that Coats came to see his departure as inevitable given his troubled relationship with Trump.\n\nOne of the most notable instances of their disagreements was last year when the intelligence chief admitted that Trump did not brief him about his behind-closed-doors meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. \"If he had asked me how that ought to be conducted, I would have suggested a different way,\" Coats said of their summit.\n\nCoats' views also diverged from the president's on North Korea. In January, Coats told Congress North Korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons, contradicting a statement by Trump that Pyongyang no longer posed a threat.\n\nDan Coats has served as Director of National Intelligence since March 2017, succeeding James Clapper. Born in Jackson, Michigan, Coats graduated from two universities with degrees in political science and law in the 1960s. He served two terms as a Republican senator for Indiana, from 1989 to 1999 and again from 2011 to 2017. Coats also served as the US ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005 in between his terms in the Senate.\n\nJohn Ratcliffe, the congressman for Texas' 4th District since 2015, is a prominent supporter of the president and his policies. Providing his nomination is approved, Ratcliffe's views are expected to align more closely with Trump's in his new role. Last Wednesday, Ratcliffe defended the president during the testimony of former special counsel Robert Mueller, who led a two-year investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer criticized Ratcliffe's appointment, stating, \"it's clear that Rep Ratcliffe was selected because he exhibited blind loyalty to President Trump with his demagogic questioning of Mueller.\"",
    " Title: \"Manafort, Gates Pleas and the Trump-Russia Investigation: A Closer Look\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his longtime associate Rick Gates have pleaded guilty to lesser charges, leading to speculation about the value of their cooperation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe fact that Gates, who was initially indicted on 32 charges, was allowed to plead guilty to only two relatively lower-level charges suggests that he may have something of value for Mueller. Legal experts presume that Gates may not have any incriminating information about President Trump but could potentially be a dangerous witness against Manafort, who could potentially threaten Trump with his involvement in a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer promising incriminating information about Hillary Clinton on behalf of Russia's government.\n\nManafort is also reported to have offered private briefings to Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch allied with President Vladimir V. Putin, whom Manafort allegedly owed $19 million. Prosecutors are interested in learning how a Republican convention platform plank on Russia's intervention in Ukraine was watered down.\n\nWhile Trump's defenders argue that Gates' credibility as a witness may be tainted due to his plea deal involving lying to the F.B.I., Ty Cobb, the White House special counsel, has stated that Manafort has no damaging information against Trump. Manafort reiterated his innocence and vowed to fight the \"untrue piled up charges\" on Friday.\n\nTrump's argument that the ongoing investigations have no connection to him resonates with many of his supporters. However, history has shown that being surrounded by people who are prosecuted can damage presidents, even when they are not directly implicated. Presidents such as Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton have faced political damage due to investigations of their aides, unrelated to them.\n\nIn the current case, the targets include not just a \"coffee boy,\" as Manafort's former adviser described George Papadopoulos, but the president's top two campaign officials and national security adviser. While Trump has dismissed the relevance of allegations against Manafort due to their business dealings before the campaign, the latest indictment claims that Manafort was scheming to defraud banks while serving as Trump's campaign chairman.",
    " Title: Ongoing Inquiries Surrounding Christopher Steele's Dossier and FBI's Handling of Information\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing investigation surrounding the controversial dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, questions persist regarding the FBI's handling of the unverified document and the links between the bureau and the dossier's creation. During Thursday's testimony, former FBI Director James Comey focused on his discussions with President Trump, but declined to address the dossier in open session due to the sensitive nature of the material.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) has been vocal in his criticism of Comey for the FBI's failure to provide documents and answer questions about Steele and his London-based company, Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd. Grassley has yet to receive a response from Comey on the matter.\n\nFor months, Grassley has expressed frustration in hearings and letters over the bureau's lack of cooperation. This week, he also called out Fusion GPS, the Washington, D.C. firm that hired Steele to collect opposition research on then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, for allegedly not cooperating with his committee.\n\nThe Steele dossier was part of the evidence the FBI used to obtain a FISA warrant for Carter Page, a peripheral adviser in the Trump campaign named in the dossier. In interviews with Fox News, Page has repeatedly denied being the Trump campaign's point person for Moscow and believes he was a target of unmasking efforts by the Obama administration.\n\nQuestions remain over how the unverified dossier was passed around on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly between June and December 2016. The person who brought the dossier to the attention of Senator John McCain last fall, former British Ambassador Sir Andrew Wood, has emphasized that \"Intelligence always needs evaluating...It is always foolish to put yourself in a position to pretend to knowledge that you do not have.\"\n\nIn an email exchange, Wood stated that while he told McCain about the material, he \"had not read and could not vouch for\" it. However, he said the material was \"produced by responsible persons.\"\n\nBritish Court documents obtained by Fox News as part of Steele's defense in a lawsuit brought against him by Russian technology guru Aleksej Gubarev identify Wood as \"an Associate of Orbis.\" The documents also state that Wood was \"aware of the Second Defendant's\" (Steele's) intelligence gathering for the pre-election memoranda.\n\nHowever, in email exchanges with Fox News on June 6, Wood told a different story. He stated, \"I have had no professional relationship with Orbis,\" and when asked about Fusion GPS, he wrote, \"I do not know Fusion apart from the fact that it exists.\"\n\nMcCain's office has not responded to Fox News' latest request for comment on the dossier. In a January 11 press release, McCain stated, \"Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI.\"",
    " Title: Clinton and Trump in Tight Race Despite Advantages, as Election Day Nears\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final stretch of the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump find themselves in a tight contest, despite several advantages for the Democratic nominee. Clinton, who had a more than 6-point lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics national average of polls after a strong stretch following the Democratic National Convention, currently holds a 2.4 percentage point lead.\n\nClinton's team believes her strong performance in Monday's debate will translate into a wider lead going into the second and third contests next month. However, polls have shown Trump ahead in the swing states of Florida and Ohio, and he has at least a fighting chance in all of the other battlegrounds, from purple states such as Nevada and Virginia to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, two states a Republican hasn't won in decades.\n\nClinton's team argues that the next presidential debate on Oct. 9 in St. Louis could be a must-win situation for the Republican. Despite the tight race, both Clinton and her supporters acknowledge they are in a dogfight over the next six weeks that could still go either way.\n\n\"I'm afraid that since Trump is backed into a corner, he'll come out swinging for the gutter,\" said Democratic strategist and Clinton surrogate Jim Manley. \"There's still a long way to go between now and the election in November. There's still lots of ups and downs and many twists to go.\"\n\nIf Clinton loses, the gains her party made in the Obama years could be turned back, from the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reform to regulatory actions on climate change and immigration. Clinton would also go down as the Democrat who lost to Trump\u2014a status she clearly does not want.\n\nClinton's campaign has been sidelined at times by storylines like the controversy over Clinton's use of a private email server at the State Department, which overshadowed her campaign and fed into the narrative that Clinton is dishonest and secretive.\n\n\"I think a lot of people have wondered why we don't have a commanding lead in the final stretch, and I think she's going to have to spend some time sealing the deal for a lot of folks,\" said one surrogate.\n\nIf Clinton is feeling the pressure, you rarely see it. On Tuesday, she said she was up for the challenge. \"You should know by now, when I set my mind on something, I keep going,\" she told reporters on her plane just weeks after a bout of pneumonia forced her off the campaign trail briefly. \"I don't quit, whatever the static, whatever the incoming is, and that's what I'll do for the American people.\"\n\nHowever, Clinton has also expressed frustration over her lead, as evidenced by her comment last week during a videoconference with the Laborers International Union of North America: \"Why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask?\" The comment was an acknowledgement of a question her supporters ask\u2014and of their frustration.\n\nThe Trump campaign has criticized Clinton for the remark and accused her of becoming \"more and more frustrated with how out of touch she is\" with voters. \"Her message is not resonating with everyday Americans, as evidenced by the closing poll numbers, and she has completely underestimated the influence of Mr. Trump's movement,\" said Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman.\n\nClinton allies say they hoped their candidate's performance on Monday night stopped Trump's momentum so they can begin building a lead again. \"I think her base may be stronger than ever, and motivated,\" one longtime Clinton adviser said. \"But, at the same time, there should be no resting on laurels.\"",
    " Title: Facebook's Dominance in Social Media Market: A Closer Look at Zuckerberg's Testimony and App Annie's Report\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent testimony before Congress, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg asserted that the company faces competition from at least eight major apps in the marketplace. However, a closer examination of the situation, as reported by TechCrunch and mobile app insight service App Annie, suggests a different narrative.\n\nAccording to App Annie, Facebook owns three of the top 10 most popular apps in the United States, and has cloned versions or features of other apps. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, ranks fourth, Facebook Messenger is sixth, and the Facebook app itself is eighth. The top three apps are games, but for all other apps, Facebook has or is working on a cloned version.\n\nYouTube, which sits at number five, is a notable example. Facebook is currently attempting to build its \"Watch Video\" section to challenge YouTube. The company has also adopted the \"Stories\" idea from the seventh most popular app, Snapchat. Furthermore, Facebook owns the 19th most popular app, WhatsApp.\n\nWhen the \"Social Media\" category on App Annie is sorted by the \"most popular\" apps, Facebook owns the top three. Zuckerberg, in response to questions about Facebook's monopolistic tendencies, stated that the average American uses eight different communication and social apps. However, the data suggests that users have limited choices when it comes to social media networks outside of Facebook, as the company has regularly sought to purchase or copy apps that may pose a threat to the company.\n\nThis revelation challenges Zuckerberg's claims of a competitive marketplace and raises questions about the level of choice and competition in the social media sector.",
    " Title: White House Staff Shakeup Looms as Trump's Handling of Comey Firing Sparks Concern\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is facing an uncertain future as former aides, Republican strategists, and sources close to the administration express concern over President Donald Trump's handling of the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Changes in the White House staff appear imminent, with many viewing a reshuffling as all but guaranteed at some point this year.\n\nThe turmoil surrounding Comey's firing has reportedly damaged morale within the White House, with aides acknowledging that it is the worst crisis to hit the administration yet. Allies close to the administration want to see Trump act decisively or move on, rather than keep his staff in limbo under threat of change.\n\nThe rumors of a shakeup have touched nearly every corner of the West Wing, including senior advisers such as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Strategist Stephen Bannon. The most intense speculation in recent days has centered on the press operation and embattled press secretary Sean Spicer.\n\nTrump's communications team was kept in the dark ahead of firing Comey, leading to a chaotic rollout that produced conflicting stories about the reasoning behind the decision. The president has publicly questioned the performance of his media relations staff, and has expressed dissatisfaction with the daily White House press briefings.\n\nWhile Trump praised Spicer as a \"nice man,\" he declined to definitively say if he would keep his current post. A subdued Spicer returned to the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room on Monday, where he faced another barrage of questions over Trump's decision to fire Comey.\n\nThose who have worked for Trump say it is common knowledge that, with the exception of family, staff members live on thin ice. The confusion over the division of responsibilities on the team of rivals Trump has assembled has created a White House where leaks have become the norm.\n\nTrump's allies say he is frustrated by the leaks, which they say are coming from advisers who either don't believe in Trump's message, refuse to buy into the way he does business, or are so obsessed by the Washington power game that they'd risk harming the administration to boost their own image.\n\nA sweeping reshuffle would bring its own set of difficulties. Trump's thirst for personal loyalty could narrow the universe of Republicans he might consider hiring, given that many top GOP aides were deeply critical of him during the 2016 campaign. It's a problem the White House has encountered as it struggles to fill posts across the federal government.\n\nThe appearance of chaos and the backdrop of uncertainty has undercut Trump's credibility on the global stage as he prepares to make his first overseas trip, which includes stops in Saudi Arabia and Israel as well as summit meetings with major U.S. allies.\n\nInsiders who spoke to the media believe that despite recent reports, Bannon is probably safe. He represents Trump's core economic nationalist vision, and it is believed that Trump's base would flee if the president narrowed his inner circle to Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and economic adviser Gary Cohn, who are viewed as liberals by many grassroots conservatives.\n\nPolitical watchers say the appearance of chaos and the backdrop of uncertainty has undercut Trump's credibility on the global stage as he prepares to make his first overseas trip, which includes stops in Saudi Arabia and Israel as well as summit meetings with major U.S. allies.",
    " Title: The Moral Case for Not Voting: Debunking Common Myths Surrounding Abstention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heated political climate of today, the act of not voting is often met with disdain and accusations of apathy. However, abstaining from voting can be a legitimate and moral choice, as it challenges the four common myths used to shame non-voters.\n\n1. A Single Vote Can Change an Election\n\nAs Katherine Mangu-Ward of \u2588\u2588\u2588 has often pointed out, the idea that a single vote can sway a major election is a myth. The chances of affecting a state-level race are slim, and a single vote has not decided a federal election in over a century. A comprehensive review by economists Casey Mulligan and Charles Hunter found just one federal race that hinged on a single vote, but a recount revealed the final difference to be much larger. Voting is akin to playing the Powerball; your life will remain the same regardless of whether you cast a ballot or not.\n\n2. Not Voting Means You Have No Right to Complain\n\nWith only about half the voting-age population casting ballots, and underrepresented groups such as young people, the poor, and the disabled, one might argue that not voting silences their voices. However, the act of voting does not make a good citizen, and it is one of the least effective ways to contribute to the American experiment. Most social and cultural change happens outside the political sphere, and that's a good thing.\n\n3. Not Voting is Unpatriotic\n\nThe notion that not voting is unpatriotic is a misconception. In fact, generations of brave Americans have fought for the right to vote\u2014and the right not to. You can choose not to vote because you love your country, and you might decide that the two-party system does not represent your interests. In that case, abstaining from voting can be a principled stand against a system that systemically silences alternative voices.\n\n4. Not Voting is a Sign of Lack of Knowledge or Engagement\n\nIf you feel uneducated or under-informed, it's understandable to question the validity of your vote. However, even the most knowledgeable voters cannot predict what a candidate will do in office. Remember when Obama was going to rein in W's foreign adventuring? It was about 10 years and one drone kill list ago. A principled citizen might actively avoid a two-party system that does not represent their interests, or decide that voting for the lesser of two evils only helps the fat cats in Washington maintain a smoke screen of legitimacy.\n\nIn conclusion, this Tuesday, go ahead and vote if it makes you happy. But if you decide that it's a symbolic act that's unlikely to tangibly help your family or community, it's okay to spend your time and resources doing something more impactful. The choice to vote or not to vote is a personal one, and it's essential to recognize that both choices can be legitimate and moral, depending on one's values and beliefs.",
    " Title: President Obama Apologizes for Health Insurance Plan Losses, Senate Introduces Bill to Delay Individual Mandate of Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Barack Obama expressed his apologies on Thursday to Americans who are losing their health insurance plans due to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The President acknowledged the hardship faced by these individuals, stating, \"I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me.\"\n\nThe President vowed to work with those affected and promised to address the issues arising from the law's implementation. The White House, while defending the health care law, has not ruled out the possibility of delaying the individual mandate.\n\nA bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate on Thursday, aiming to delay the implementation of the individual mandate by one year. This move would exempt Americans from a $95 penalty for not having health insurance, a penalty scheduled to kick in next year.\n\nThe bill, introduced by Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), aims to provide Americans with more time to explore their health insurance options. The bill's proponents argue that the delay will make 2014 a \"true transition year.\"\n\nSenator Manchin stated, \"We need to start working together to fix this law and make it work so that all Americans have access to affordable and reliable health care coverage.\"\n\nThe bill acknowledges the positive components of the Affordable Care Act but also recognizes the problems that have arisen. It suggests a one-year delay of the individual mandate to eliminate penalty fees for individuals who choose not to enroll in a health care plan in 2014.\n\nThe bill also emphasizes the need for commonsense reforms to the law, stating, \"Healthcare should not be a burden on consumers, which is why we must delay the penalty for individuals.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner responded to Obama's apology, stating, \"An apology is certainly in order, but what Americans want to hear is that the president is going to keep his promise.\"\n\nThe bill is a significant step towards addressing the issues arising from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and it remains to be seen how the legislation will progress through Congress.",
    " Title: India Implements World's Largest Lockdown to Combat COVID-19 Outbreak\n\nIndia will initiate the world's largest lockdown starting Wednesday, as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a televised address. The 21-day lockdown aims to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, with Modi warning citizens to stay indoors or risk inviting the pandemic into their homes. The move affects nearly one-fifth of the world's population.\n\nIndian health officials have reported 469 active cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and 10 deaths. The rapid increase in cases, which Modi described as having the potential to \"spread like wildfire,\" has prompted the government to invoke a British Raj-era epidemic act granting it sweeping powers to manage the disease.\n\nFor weeks, while the coronavirus ravaged neighboring China and other parts of Asia, India's infection toll remained low, with just three cases, all students in the Chinese epicenter, Wuhan, who recovered in their home state of Kerala. However, since the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic, the cases have been growing rapidly.\n\nEssential service providers, including hospitals, police, and media, had been exempted from the stay-at-home orders, and many grocery stores and pharmacies remained open. Modi's Tuesday announcement, however, was labeled a \"total lockdown,\" and it remains unclear whether any service providers will be exempt.\n\nThe lockdown's impact on the approximately 300 million Indians living below the poverty line is uncertain, with Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman promising a comprehensive relief package to be announced soon.\n\nIndian virologist Dr. T. Jacob John, before the lockdown was announced, stated that India was being compelled to take extreme containment measures after failing to mitigate the problem earlier when the caseload was light.\n\n\"There would have been time because the wolf was not yet at the door. Now today the wolf's inside the door and India's supposed to calmly respond with a wolf in the corner,\" he said.",
    " Title: Unconventional Diplomacy: Mike Pompeo's Secret Meeting with Kim Jong Un and the State Department Void\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Washington D.C., the revelation of a clandestine meeting between Mike Pompeo and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the end of last month has stirred intrigue, not just for the high-profile figures involved, but also for the unusual circumstances surrounding the encounter.\n\nOrdinarily, the Secretary of State would have been the one to embark on such a clandestine journey to Pyongyang, as Madeleine Albright did at the turn of the century. However, in the unpredictable realm of the Trump administration, the outgoing Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director, a former congressman with limited diplomatic experience, was dispatched to represent the United States.\n\nThe current administration, which is currently without a permanent Secretary of State, has been criticized for sidelining the State Department's diplomatic corps in recent months, if not years. \"They have been completely sidelined from foreign policy, certainly in the last six months\u2014if not the last year,\" said a senior administration official familiar with the situation. \"Tillerson was an afterthought when these decisions were being made.\"\n\nThe circumstances of the Pompeo-Kim meeting were primarily a function of timing. The dismissal of Rex Tillerson, the former Secretary of State, just days after President Donald Trump agreed to meet with Kim, left Pompeo\u2014nominated by Trump to be Tillerson's successor\u2014to take the lead on the administration's negotiations with Pyongyang.\n\nAccording to a report by The Washington Post, Pompeo made contact through a back channel between the CIA and its North Korean intelligence counterpart, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. On his visit to North Korea over Easter, Pompeo was reportedly accompanied by a small group of CIA officials, but no one from the White House or the State Department.\n\nTrump's decision to task Pompeo with meeting Kim was less about his role as spy chief than his close personal relationship with the former Tea Party lawmaker. \"The relationships that we have built with the North Koreans in anticipation of any kind of summit have been more of a personality-driven tasking to Pompeo than necessarily a CIA-is-leading-this tasking,\" an administration official told me. \"I think the president, in the absence of Tillerson and in the absence of other options and in the presence of a close tie that he feels to Pompeo and a trust he has in Pompeo\u2014I think this has kind of been handed to Pompeo.\"\n\nAs the upcoming North Korea summit\u2014tentatively planned for late May or early June\u2014approaches, the larger question hanging over the proceedings is whether Pompeo continues to take point as he navigates the administration's foreign policy, particularly in relation to Trump's equally ambitious National Security Advisor, John Bolton, a notorious war hawk who has advocated for a pre-emptive military strike.\n\n\"I think [given] Bolton's outlook on North Korea, which is well-known because he has written about it extensively, it wouldn't be surprising if his lack of enthusiasm about a diplomatic solution to the North Korea problem doesn't get in the way of this process going forward,\" said Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation who has engaged North Korean officials in unofficial discussions. \"It does beg to question whether he's the right person to be the president's national security adviser at this time.\"\n\nIn the ever-changing landscape of Trump's administration, the future of U.S.-North Korea relations remains uncertain, with the potential for diplomatic and personal dynamics to shape the course of negotiations.",

A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right.\" He continued, \"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won\u2019t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\"\n\nWhen embedded in a post, the tweet does not show the censorship label that Twitter applied. However, a screenshot of the tweet on Twitter's platform shows the censorship label.\n\nIn a statement, Twitter Comms said, \"This Tweet violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today.\" Twitter added, \"We\u2019ve taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts, but have kept the Tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the Tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance.\"\n\nTwitter's actions against the president come after Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that took action against social media companies for repeatedly discriminating against and censoring conservatives. The executive order was issued after Twitter started applying controversial labels to Trump's tweets while largely ignoring false statements from Democrats and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nTwitter took no action against numerous tweets that appeared to encourage rioting, destruction of property, or fighting against law enforcement. The following controversial tweets, which Twitter did not take any action against, are from public figures or they are tweets that went viral on the platform and garnered tens of thousands of retweets.\n\nIn 2014, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's company \"painted # blacklivesmatter on a wall at its San Francisco headquarters,\" according to USA Today. In 2018, Dorsey promoted an article on his Twitter account that essentially called for turning the entire United States into California and completely eliminating the Republican Party.\n\nIn an article titled \"The Great Lesson of California in America's New Civil War,\" authors Peter Leyden and Ruy Teixeira argued that America is already in the midst of a second major domestic conflict of sorts and the way out is for the rest of the country to imitate California. They called for a complete marginalization of the Republican Party and its voters since they only care \"about rule by and for billionaires at the expense of working people\" and not \"average citizens.\"\n\nDespite California's mass wealth inequality, growing lack of social cohesion, poverty, and soaring housing costs, the authors argued that California provides a model for America as a whole.

    " Title: North Korea Announces Disarmament Ceremony at Nuclear Test Site Ahead of U.S.-DPRK Summit\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Korea has announced plans to dismantle its nuclear testing site in a three-day ceremony from May 23-25, ahead of the highly anticipated summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The event, which will involve the destruction of tunnels, removal of observation and research facilities, and ground-based testing units, is part of North Korea's commitment to discontinue nuclear tests.\n\nAccording to a statement released by North Korea's Foreign Ministry on Saturday, the Nuclear Weapon Institute and other concerned institutions are taking technical measures to dismantle the northern nuclear test ground of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The announcement also stated that the country plans to invite journalists from the United States, South Korea, China, Russia, and Britain to observe the dismantling process.\n\nAnalysts have suggested that the closure of the site is mostly symbolic and does not represent a significant step towards denuclearization. The announcement comes after Trump announced a summit with Kim in Singapore on June 12, marking the first meeting ever between a sitting U.S. president and the leader of North Korea.\n\nKim had initially revealed plans to shut down the nuclear test site during his summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month. However, the North's statement on Saturday did not include any mention of allowing international experts on the site.\n\nFollowing the Moon-Kim summit, Moon's office said Kim was willing to disclose the process to international experts, but the North's statement did not include any such commitment. On Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said North Korea could look forward to \"a future brimming with peace and prosperity\" if it agrees to quickly give up its nuclear weapons.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted six known nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri site, a location in the northeastern part of North Korea where a system of tunnels has been dug under Mount Mantap, according to Reuters. The closure of the site could serve as a useful precedent for Washington and Seoul as they proceed with nuclear negotiations with Pyongyang, analysts say.\n\nAdam Mount, a senior defense analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, stated, \"Now that North Korea has accepted in principle that agreements should be verified, U.S. negotiators should hold them to this standard for any subsequent agreement. It will make it more difficult for Kim Jong Un to deny inspections now that he has placed them on the table.\"",
    " Title: U.S. and Russia Reach Agreement on Syrian Chemical Weapons, Averting U.S. Military Action\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In a dramatic turn of events, the United States and Russia have reached an agreement on securing Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, effectively removing the threat of U.S. military action. After more than two weeks of tense diplomatic negotiations, the deal, which will be closely scrutinized by a skeptical Congress, offers a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons issue in Syria.\n\nThe agreement, announced on Saturday, requires Syria to remove or destroy its chemical weapons stockpile by 2014, with international inspections beginning by November. The Syrians will offer full disclosure of their chemical weapons arsenal within a week. Any potential violations by the Syrian regime will be taken to the United Nations Security Council for response.\n\nPresident Obama, in a statement on Saturday, acknowledged that \"much more work remains to be done\" and emphasized the international community's expectations for the Assad regime to honor its public commitments. Secretary of State John Kerry, who negotiated the deal with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Geneva, was more blunt, stating that the U.S. has committed to a standard of \"verify and verify.\"\n\nThe deal, which was finalized over three days of negotiations, allows both sides to claim that they have not ceded their authority to use force in response to further violations by the Assad regime. President Obama has been adamant about the need to take away the Assad regime's ability to conduct chemical attacks, while President Putin has argued that it is unrealistic to expect the Syrian government to hand over weapons while facing the threat of military action.\n\nThe deal's implementation will likely meet Obama's goals of disarming the Assad regime, but it may make it more difficult for the White House to hold the Syrian government accountable for the brutal Aug. 21 attack that killed 1,400 Syrian civilians on the outskirts of Damascus. Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed skepticism about Syria's willingness to follow through on the agreement.\n\nThe deal, while far from perfect, offers the Obama administration a way out of its unpopular call for military action. Jim Walsh, an expert on international security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's security studies program, noted that \"Obama is a winner on this substantively, but the optics on this are bad.\" Walsh added that \"Syria does not get bombed, and Assad is happy about that. The Russians are winners because they look like they are birthing a diplomatic solution to what was going to be another war in the Middle East.\"\n\nDespite the deal's success in averting U.S. military action, the Obama administration will face continued scrutiny and skepticism from Congress and the American public as it works to implement the agreement and ensure Syria's compliance.",
    " Title: Chelsea Manning Released from Prison After 62-Day Imprisonment for Refusal to Testify Before Grand Jury\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning has been released from prison after 62 days of confinement, following the expiration of the term of the grand jury that ordered her detention in March. Manning, 31, was held in contempt of court for refusing to answer questions about Wikileaks during the investigation.\n\nIn a statement, Manning's lawyers said, \"Today marked the expiration of the term of the grand jury, and so, after 62 days of confinement, Chelsea was released from the Alexandria Detention Center earlier today.\" However, the statement adds, Manning was served with another subpoena, which could potentially lead to her being held in contempt of court again.\n\nManning was found guilty in 2013 of charges including espionage for leaking secret military files to Wikileaks, but her sentence was later commuted. She has refused to answer further questions about Wikileaks from investigators because she says she has already presented her testimony during her 2013 trial.\n\nThe statement continues, \"Chelsea will continue to refuse to answer questions, and will use every available legal defense to prove that she has just cause for her refusal to give testimony.\" When she refused to testify in March, her lawyers reportedly asked that she be confined at home due to medical issues, but the judge said US Marshals would address her care needs.\n\nUS prosecutors have been investigating Wikileaks for years, and in November, prosecutors inadvertently revealed possible charges against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in court documents from a separate case. Manning was arrested in Iraq in 2010 for disclosing more than 700,000 confidential documents, videos, and diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy website.\n\nWhile Manning said she only did so to spark debates about foreign policy, US officials said the leak put lives at risk. She was sentenced to 35 years after being found guilty of 20 charges related to the leak, but then-President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017. Her sentence was the longest given for a leak in US history. President Obama said it was \"disproportionate\" to her crimes.",
    " Title: Former NSA Director Expects Obama to Maintain Current Intelligence Gathering Practices in Upcoming Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn anticipation of President Barack Obama's upcoming speech on changes to the National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance programs, former NSA Director Michael Hayden has stated that he does not expect any significant alterations to the way the government collects intelligence.\n\nDuring an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Hayden expressed his belief that the language of the speech will emphasize transformation, transparency, and checks and balances, but the substance will primarily involve maintaining the status quo.\n\n\"I think what we are going to see in the speech, Joe, is all of the language in the speech kind of fading left about transformation and transparency and checks and balances, but, frankly, I think the substance of the speech is going to be holding his ground,\" Hayden said.\n\nShortly after Hayden's appearance on MSNBC, news broke that Obama would propose the NSA to relinquish control over the phone data it collects, but would not specify who should take control of the data.\n\nHayden, however, highlighted that the president's primary objective in the speech is to reassure the public rather than to change the current practices.\n\n\"His mission here, I don't think, is to change what we're doing. His mission here is to make people more comfortable about what it is that the intelligence agencies are doing,\" Hayden said.\n\nThe retired general and former CIA director identified the key questions Obama will address in the NSA's phone data collection as the location of the data and the methods for querying it. Hayden anticipates that the president will defer the first question to Congress, while the NSA will continue to hold the data.\n\nRegarding the second question, Hayden expressed concern about requiring intelligence agencies to seek a judge's approval every time they want to query data, stating that such a requirement would resemble the pre-9/11 mindset and make him feel uncomfortable.\n\nThe president's 11 a.m. speech is the culmination of a months-long review of the surveillance programs made public last summer by leaker Edward Snowden. Prior to Hayden's interview, the White House had not confirmed the specific changes Obama would propose.",
    " Title: Analysis: Warren and Booker Shine in Democratic Debate, Critiques for Moderators' Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest Democratic presidential debate, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker were praised by the left for their strong performances, while the moderators faced some critiques for their approach to questioning.\n\nWarren's message on domestic politics was well-received, as she emphasized her commitment to making government work for the majority of Americans. She shared her personal story of overcoming financial hardships to attend college, and expressed her belief that every American should have the same opportunity to unlock their potential.\n\n\"Warren wants every person in America to have that same chance to unlock their potential, and she fundamentally believes America can still provide it if a movement of people rises up and invests in that dream,\" said one commentator.\n\nHowever, some critics argue that Warren's plan for Medicare for All may be her own greatest obstacle. While the concept polls well, the idea of replacing all private health insurance could alienate potential supporters.\n\nBooker, on the other hand, spoke compellingly on a range of issues without getting lost in policy wonk weeds. He addressed immigration and the profiteering of health care companies, and offered a positive message in his closing statement, saying he would beat President Trump by calling the country to a sense of common purpose again.\n\nThe candidates were also criticized for dodging the question of GOP obstruction, particularly in light of Mitch McConnell's history of blocking Democratic efforts. When asked about dealing with McConnell, Warren responded that she had a plan, but her response and those of the other candidates showed the limitations of their proposals without a Democratic majority in Congress.\n\nThe moderators were also criticized for their approach to foreign policy questions, particularly a lightning round in which each candidate was asked to name the \"greatest geopolitical threat\" to the United States in one word. The format was criticized for its lack of nuance and its assumption that the best way to assess a potential president's foreign policy is by finding out what they are most afraid of.\n\nOverall, the debate was a reminder of the strengths and weaknesses of the Democratic field, and a call for more nuanced and thoughtful questioning in future debates.",
    " Title: California Bishop Urges Tighter Gun Control Measures in Letter to U.S. Senators\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a written petition to U.S. senators, Bishop Stephen Blair, chairman of the bishops' Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development, called for stricter gun control measures in the United States. The Catholic News Agency reported that the bishop's letter emphasized the need to address the issue of gun violence in society, citing the frequent occurrence of such incidents in homes and communities.\n\nBishop Blair, in his letter, referenced the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 (S. 649) as a positive step towards reducing gun violence. He expressed hope that this bill would provide a foundation for Congress to continue addressing the issue of gun violence. The restrictions and regulations contained in the bill, according to the bishop, would foster a culture of life by promoting policies that reduce gun violence and save lives.\n\nSpecifically, the bishop called for the federal government to restrict civilian access to high-capacity ammunition magazines and to outright ban all assault-type weapons. These measures, he believed, would contribute to a culture of life by reducing gun violence.\n\nWhile some members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops have expressed support for stronger gun controls, the Catholic Church has not adopted a political policy on the issue. Pope John Paul II, in his Evangelium Vitae in 1995, stated that guns can be used in self-defense, aligning with church teachings. He wrote, \"Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for someone responsible for another's life, the common good of the family or of the state.\"\n\nBishop Blair's call for tighter gun control measures comes as President Obama continues to press for stricter gun control. The Senate is expected to take up gun control issues on Thursday, following a deal brokered by Sens. Pat Toomey (Pennsylvania Republican) and Joe Manchin (West Virginia Democrat) on background checks.",
    " Title: California's Drought Deepens: NASA Images Reveal Historic Water Loss\n\nArticle:\n\nA series of images captured by NASA satellites reveals the intensifying drought situation in California. As of the latest report, the entire state is experiencing drought conditions, with over half classified as \"exceptional\" drought, the most severe level.\n\nThe images, taken in June of 2002, 2008, and 2014, show a significant decrease in California's water storage since 2002. The Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins, which encompass the Central Valley, have been the most affected, losing approximately 4 trillion gallons of water each year between 2011 and 2014. This loss surpasses the annual water consumption of California's 38 million residents in cities and homes.\n\nThe images, marked by orange and red colors indicating greater water loss, highlight the dramatic impact of the drought. The increased groundwater pumping for agricultural purposes is a significant contributing factor to the losses in these river basins.\n\nAs of Thursday, the U.S. Drought Monitor reported that 100% of California was in a drought, with more than 58% in \"exceptional\" drought. The state has experienced record warmth in 2014, making it the hottest year since records began in 1895, according to data from the National Climatic Data Center.\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown declared a statewide drought emergency earlier this year. Since then, reservoir storage levels have continued to decline, and as of Thursday, they were down to about 52% of the historical average.\n\nIn response, regulations restricting outdoor water use were implemented in late July for the entire state. Residents are prohibited from hosing down driveways or sidewalks, and watering lawns and landscapes is only allowed if there is no excess runoff. Reports suggest that wells are running dry in central California.\n\nAdditionally, about 1,000 more wildfires than usual have ravaged the state, including some unusual ones in the spring. The drought conditions have contributed to these wildfires, further exacerbating the state's water crisis.",
    " Title: Unforeseen Change in Accommodations for North Korea-U.S. Summit in Hanoi\n\nArticle:\n\nHANOI, Vietnam - In an unexpected turn of events, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump's second summit in Vietnam has seen a change in the accommodations for the American press. Instead of the Melia Hotel, where Kim Jong Un is currently staying, the White House press corps has been relocated to the Viet Xo Friendship Cultural Labour Palace.\n\nPrior to Kim's arrival, South Korean media and experts had anticipated Kim's stay at the Melia Hotel as a strategic move to expose himself to the American press. However, minutes after Kim arrived at a Vietnamese border station on Tuesday, the Vietnamese foreign ministry announced the Melia Hanoi Hotel would no longer host the press center for hundreds of visiting American journalists.\n\nThe sudden relocation left reporters and other guests at the Melia in uncertainty, as it was widely expected that Kim would stay there, with sources confirming the North Korean leader's plans to the media last week. Kim's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, and his close aide Kim Chang Son had also inspected the hotel during their visits to Vietnam.\n\nThe Melia Hotel had been set up to host the White House press center, with the third floor reserved for the press and an entire ballroom reserved for the North Korean delegation. Despite these arrangements, the Melia was still considered a potential location for the White House press until Kim set foot off his train.\n\nThe reasons behind the change in accommodations remain unclear. The North Korean leader and President Trump will meet in the Vietnamese capital on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss a North Korean pledge to give up its nuclear weapons program.",
    " Title: Trump's Tariffs: A Misguided Approach to Boosting U.S. Economy, According to Economist Noah Smith\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his latest opinion piece, Noah Smith, a former assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University and a blogger at Noahpinion, questions the effectiveness of President Donald Trump's tariffs on the U.S. economy. Smith argues that the tariffs are a poor choice due to their impact on intermediate goods, a concept rooted in tax theory.\n\nSmith explains that intermediate goods are items used in the production of other, more complex products, such as steel for cars, transistors for computer chips, and screens for mobile phones. According to economists Peter Diamond and James Mirrlees, taxing these goods can lead to reduced production, as companies produce less than they would without the tax. This, in turn, results in a smaller economic pie to divide among consumers.\n\nChad Brown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics provides data that supports Smith's argument. Brown's calculations show that most of the $50 billion worth of Chinese products that Trump is threatening to impose tariffs on are intermediate goods or capital goods used by U.S. manufacturers. This, according to Smith, will negatively impact a significant number of U.S. companies, particularly manufacturers.\n\nSmith suggests that if Trump wants to support American manufacturing, he should avoid using taxes to restrict the materials and equipment U.S. factories need. Instead, he proposes focusing on promoting U.S. exports, implementing a Value-Added Tax (VAT) system, or targeting consumer goods with tariffs.\n\nA VAT, Smith explains, is an efficient form of taxation that can fund healthcare, housing subsidies, and other services for poor Americans, addressing the concern that VATs disproportionately affect the poor. Smith also suggests that a VAT might satisfy Trump's desire for a trade war, as he seems to view VATs as a form of tariff on imported goods, although this is not accurate.\n\nThis article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or the owner of \u2588\u2588\u2588 LP.",
    " Title: Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Speaks Out Against Presidential Attacks, Alleges Unfair Treatment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has expressed his dismay over what he perceives as a tarnishing of his reputation following a 21-year career in law enforcement. McCabe, who served as the FBI's second-in-command during one of the bureau's most turbulent periods, has been a subject of public attacks by President Donald Trump.\n\nDuring his tenure, McCabe oversaw investigations into both the Trump campaign and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. He assumed the role of acting FBI director after the sudden firing of his predecessor, James Comey, and publicly contradicted the White House on national television over the support of rank-and-file FBI agents for Comey.\n\nPresident Trump has consistently targeted McCabe, suggesting that he helped shield Clinton from prosecution during the 2016 presidential campaign. The president's evidence for this claim includes the fact that McCabe's wife, Jill, ran for a State Senate seat in Virginia and received substantial donations from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton ally.\n\nAs recently as Thursday, the White House reiterated its criticism of McCabe, with Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stating, \"It is well documented that he has had some very troubling behavior and by most accounts, a bad actor.\" McCabe's lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich, responded to these comments, labeling them as \"vile and defamatory\" and suggesting they were intended to influence the Department of Justice's disciplinary process.\n\nBromwich further stated, \"This intervention by the White House in the D.O.J. disciplinary process is unprecedented, deeply unfair, and dangerous.\" McCabe's wife lost her race, and he was later promoted to deputy director, where he oversaw the investigation into Clinton. Despite no charges being filed in that case, Trump has used the donations to McCabe's campaign as evidence of FBI bias.",
    " Title: McConnell Assures No Default on U.S. Debt, Vows to Raise Borrowing Limit\n\nArticle:\n\nLouisville, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has stated that there is \"zero chance\" Congress will allow the country to default on its debts by failing to increase the borrowing limit. McConnell made these comments during a joint appearance in his home state of Kentucky with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday.\n\nMcConnell's remarks came amidst President Donald Trump's public criticism of him for failing to pass a repeal and replacement of former President Barack Obama's health care law. During the event, McConnell did not mention Trump and did not take questions from reporters.\n\nWhen asked about his news sources, McConnell said he reads a variety of sources, including The New York Times. In response to a question about his news sources, McConnell said, \"My view is most news is not fake. I try not to fall in love with any particular source.\"\n\nThe government has enough money to pay its bills until Sept. 29. After that, Congress would have to grant permission for the government to borrow more money to meet its obligations, including Social Security and interest payments. McConnell sought to calm a crowd of nervous business leaders by interjecting at the end of Mnuchin's answer to a question about what would happen if lawmakers did not increase the borrowing limit.\n\n\"Let me just add, there is zero chance, no chance, we won't raise the debt ceiling,\" McConnell said. \"America is not going to default.\"\n\nAddressing the country's borrowing limit will be the most pressing issue when lawmakers return to Washington following their August recess. After that, Republicans will likely turn their attention to overhauling the nation's tax code.\n\nMcConnell also addressed other pressing issues, stating that Congress is unlikely to repeal a pair of Obama-era laws most hated by conservatives. While negotiations about health care are ongoing, McConnell said the path forward is \"somewhat murky.\" And he said it would be \"challenging\" to lift the restrictions placed on banks following the 2008 financial crisis, known as \"Dodd-Frank.\"\n\nOn tax reform, McConnell said the only things lawmakers won't consider eliminating are deductions on mortgage interest and charitable deductions.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Officially Enters 2016 Presidential Race, Kicks off Campaign with Iowa Tour\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that ends years of speculation, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has officially announced her intention to seek the 2016 Democratic nomination for president on Sunday afternoon. According to sources close to the campaign, Clinton is expected to make the announcement via a video and social media, with some suggesting a possible video message.\n\nAt present, Clinton, who is long considered the Democratic front-runner without a formal announcement, faces minimal competition for the Democratic nomination. Polls barely register former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley or former Virginia Senator Jim Webb. A potential heavyweight, Vice President Joe Biden, has expressed interest in a campaign but has yet to take significant steps towards preparation.\n\nOn Thursday, former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee entered the race, offering a critical view from the left of Clinton's foreign policy record. \"The biggest question will be: What exactly did you accomplish in your four years as secretary of state?\" he said in an interview. \"There was a lot of dust in the air. Not many concrete accomplishments.\"\n\nAnnouncing now gives Clinton an edge, as she lost a contested primary to then-Senator Barack Obama for her party's nomination in 2008. The early announcement allows her fundraising team more time to generate the hundreds of millions of dollars typically required for a successful presidential bid.\n\nFollowing the Sunday announcement, Clinton is expected to travel to the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa early next week for campaign events. Democratic strategists and advisers spoke on condition of anonymity because Clinton has not yet finalized all aspects of her announcement plan.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Clinton is expected to stay in Iowa for at least a month of small, unscripted events with small groups of voters. NPR's Mara Liasson reports that Clinton is expected to focus on grassroots campaigning, aiming to connect with voters on a personal level.",
    " Title: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel Condemns Rep. Ilhan Omar's Anti-Semitic Remarks in The Atlantic Op-Ed\n\nIn an opinion piece published in The Atlantic on Thursday, former Obama Chief of Staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel criticized Rep. Ilhan Omar for her anti-Semitic comments. Emanuel's stance differs from other Democrats who view Omar's comments as criticism of Israel rather than anti-Semitic.\n\nEmanuel was direct in his position, stating, \"Her remarks are not anti-Israel; they are anti-Semitic.\" He argued that Omar's comments cross a line in political discourse and perpetuate age-old stereotypes about Jews.\n\nEmanuel pointed out that Omar's remarks suggest a dual loyalty among Jewish Americans, implying a questioning of their devotion to America. He noted that he has personally experienced this trope in some of his political campaigns, with false assertions about his background and loyalties.\n\nThe Chicago Mayor emphasized that the relationship between the United States and Israel is deep and abiding, with Israel sharing fundamental values with the United States that most of its neighbors have never embraced. He also highlighted Israel's democratic principles, such as women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and the ability of Arab citizens to vote and serve in the Israeli Parliament.\n\nEmanuel made it clear that a politician can be critical of Israel without being anti-Semitic. He acknowledged that Jewish Americans who support Israel do so because of shared values and national interests, and that many are not afraid to criticize Israel when its policies are wrong or to champion American interests when they conflict with Israeli goals.\n\nHowever, Emanuel also emphasized that Omar's remarks should not be given a pass due to her status as a Muslim in Congress. He commended Emanuel for his courage in calling out Omar's anti-Semitic remarks.",
    " Title: The Role of Individuals in America's Reopening: A Call for Personal Freedom and Responsibility\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate between governors and President Trump over who holds the authority to reopen America, it is crucial to recognize that the power lies not with the politicians, but with individuals, families, businesses, and religious congregations. While politicians can ease lockdown orders and school closures, they do not control the decision to resume normal activities.\n\nAmerica's reopening will not be a result of top-down orders from politicians. Instead, it will be a response to the collective decisions of individuals, families, businesses, and religious congregations, based on their own assessments of risk and need. As Nate Silver, a renowned data analyst, aptly put it, \"people will vote with their feet.\"\n\nThe desire for human connection, the need for economic activity, and the religious impulse are powerful motivators. Families yearn to reunite, businesses seek to reopen, and religious congregations aim to tend to their spiritual needs. The first business or establishment to reopen safely, providing a safe environment, will likely attract customers eager to return to normalcy.\n\nReligious leaders, too, are advocating for the reopening of churches, emphasizing the importance of spiritual nourishment. The New Boston Post, in an editorial, suggested that church leaders should initiate the process of reopening their churches without regard for civil authorities, as the Constitution explicitly limits the role of government in religious matters.\n\nTimothy P. Carney, writing for The Washington Examiner, proposed a solution where churches could reopen with social distancing measures in place, making worship services safer than shopping at a store like Home Depot, which remains open.\n\nUltimately, the best plan for reopening America is one that aligns with American values: freedom, competition, choice, and diversity, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. This approach emphasizes the protection of individual, family, business, and religious freedoms, rather than controlling their activities according to a predetermined schedule, even in the name of public health. This conception of government's role is outlined in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, where the government's role is to protect natural or God-given freedoms, rather than turning them on or off.",
    " Title: Local Governments Called to Action: Baby Boomer Leaders Mobilize to Support Communities Amid COVID-19 Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is posing a significant challenge to society, akin to the Great Depression and World War II. The baby boomer generation, who lived through the Great Depression and witnessed the aftermath of World War II, are now facing the first major societal challenge of their lifetime. The response to this crisis will shape the impact of the virus on our population.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt utilized the federal government to create jobs and stimulate the economy. Automobile companies transitioned from manufacturing cars to producing tanks and bombers to aid in the defeat of Germany and Japan. The Greatest Generation made significant sacrifices to preserve America's freedom and democracy.\n\nNow, it is our turn. As the baby boomer generation continues to serve in local government, they will be tasked with making decisions that will help citizens navigate this difficult time. Unemployment is rising, and many are struggling to pay rent and purchase essential supplies. Schools are closed, and working parents require childcare and hot meals during the day. The question remains: Who will provide and pay for these services?\n\nLocal government is urged to step up and offer the safety net needed during the next few months until the virus is under control. Local governments, including Kitsap County, the four cities (Bremerton, Poulsbo, Port Orchard, and Bainbridge Island), school districts, ports, and other various governments, should collaborate to ensure that citizens do not lose their housing and have access to food and childcare.\n\nCary Bozeman, a commissioner for the Port of Bremerton and former mayor of Bremerton, emphasizes the need for local leaders to take action, develop a plan, and support those most in need during this challenging time. Bozeman suggests that local governments may need to tap into reserves or even borrow money at low interest rates to provide the necessary resources for their communities.\n\nWe cannot rely solely on federal or state governments for assistance during this crisis. Local leaders must step forward, devise a plan, and support those in need. With unity and determination, we can overcome this difficult period in our lives.",
    " Title: Hugo Chavez: A Controversial Leader Who Transformed Venezuela\n\nArticle:\n\nHugo Chavez, the former President of Venezuela, passed away on Tuesday, leaving behind a complex legacy that has been both celebrated and criticized. Born in 1954 to a poor family in the Great Savannah, Chavez rose to power through democratic means, transforming Venezuela into a socialist state.\n\nChavez, who ruled Venezuela from 1999 until his death, was a charismatic figure who gained the love and support of millions of Venezuelans due to his social programs aimed at the poor. However, his tenure was marked by economic problems such as high inflation, food shortages, and other economic issues. Despite his efforts to turn the country's oil wealth into broad-based prosperity, Venezuela was, in some ways, worse off when he died than when he began.\n\nChavez was a fiery leftist who was a steadfast ally of dictators like Cuba's Fidel Castro while opposing the United States. He claimed capitalism was destroying the world and sought to transform Venezuela into a socialist state. Chavez was omnipresent during his years in power, with his face plastered on billboards and his voice dominating the airwaves. His main vehicle was a Sunday TV show, \"Hello Mr. President,\" where he ranted against American leaders.\n\nChavez had a gift for whipping the crowds into a frenzy, pledging that their country would be great. He was also known for his folksy and funny demeanor, which helped him build an almost mystical connection with poor Venezuelans. Chavez used his political capital and a powerful base to launch what he called 21st Century Socialism, nationalizing companies, seizing farmland, and forming alliances with like-minded leaders who opposed the United States.\n\nChavez's greatest success was making those who'd been marginalized feel that they were part of something bigger. He was instrumental in providing 100,000 subsidized barrels of oil each day for Communist Cuba, in exchange for doctors and intelligence agents. Chavez also helped poor Americans heat their homes through Citgo, a gasoline retailer owned by Venezuela.\n\nHowever, Chavez's tenure was not without controversy. He supported a violent guerrilla movement in neighboring Colombia, jailed some opponents, and labeled his critics as degenerates and squealing pigs. Chavez's government was far from democratic, with power being concentrated in his own hands and institutions like the judiciary being completely controlled by him.\n\nIn conclusion, Hugo Chavez was a charismatic and controversial leader who transformed Venezuela into a socialist state. While he gained the love and support of millions of Venezuelans due to his social programs aimed at the poor, his tenure was marked by economic problems and controversy. Chavez's legacy will continue to be debated, and his impact on Venezuela and the wider region will be felt for years to come.",
    " Title: Tragedy Strikes Marine Corps Base Quantico: Two Marines Killed, Shooter Apparent Suicide\n\nArticle:\n\nA shooting incident at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia left two Marines dead and another apparent suicide on Thursday night. The shooter, a Marine, gunned down a man and a woman, base officials said.\n\nThe incident took place at the Officer Candidate School within the base. The shooter was a permanent personnel assigned to the school. Authorities have not disclosed a motive for the shooting and are currently investigating the incident. The identities of the victims have not been released as authorities work to notify next of kin.\n\nCol David Maxwell, the base commander, described it as a \"long night.\" The shooting has shocked the military community, coming as the Corps is still grieving over another tragedy: the deaths of seven U.S. Marines in a training exercise in Nevada on Monday.\n\nSecretary of Defense Chuck Hagel expressed his condolences, stating, \"This tragedy, as well as the tragedy in Nevada earlier this week, took the lives of Marines who volunteered to serve their nation. His heart and his prayers are with them and their families. He believes that the legendary strength of the United States Marine Corps will ensure that they are forever remembered.\"\n\nInitial reports of the shooting came late Thursday when authorities found one dead victim. A lockdown was announced at the base, and police surrounded the building where the suspect was believed to be barricaded. They ordered everyone to stay in their homes, doors locked.\n\nAuthorities from the base and Prince William County, Virginia, surrounded the shooter, who was in a barracks not far from where the first shooting occurred. Law enforcement officials entered the barracks two hours later and discovered the shooter dead, apparently of a self-inflicted wound. The female victim was in the room with him, fatally shot.\n\nThe lockdown ended early Friday, a few hours after it started. As dawn rose over the base, Maxwell told reporters that there were no barricades or a standoff but did not elaborate. The incident was confined to a single barracks at the candidate school.\n\nMaxwell said \"quick\" police reaction helped resolve the situation, first reported at 10:30 p.m. via an emergency call. Soon, security was heightened, and a mass notification was issued throughout the base. Base restrictions were lifted a few hours later.\n\nOthers in the officer candidate school were \"accounted for and safe.\" Maxwell also asked for the support of the community and their thoughts and prayers for the Marines who have lost their comrades-in-arms.\n\nThe base, known for its historical significance, houses the Iwo Jima Monument, a grand statue that gives pause to all who enter about the important role the base has played in training generations of Marines in forging military doctrine and fighting America's wars. The statue depicts the historic flag-raising on Mount Suribachi, on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima, during the famous World War II battle there.\n\nThe Quantico base, started during World War I, has been integral in training, education, and forging military doctrine for America's battles. Early on, amphibious warfare was, the corps said, \"conceived and perfected\" there. The Marines there came up with the idea \"of carrying troops from ship to shore by helicopter.\"\n\nNow, it's home to the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, which conducts experiments in modern warfare. Federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI, share training facilities there. The base also has a reputation across popular culture as a key national security training location. Jack Ryan, writer Tom Clancy's well-known character in novels and films, took officer training there.",
    " Title: White House Physician Confirms President Trump's Health and Cognitive Ability in Detailed Briefing\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing a comprehensive health examination last week, White House Physician, Navy Rear Adm. Dr. Ronny Jackson, provided a detailed account of President Trump's health during a news conference on Tuesday. The assessment indicates that President Trump, at 71 years old, is in excellent health and likely will remain so for years to come.\n\nThe conference was met with questions from the media, some of which sought to find flaws in Dr. Jackson's report. However, it is noteworthy that the president scored a perfect 30 out of 30 on a cognitive test, a result that impressed the medical team and corroborated their personal impression of the president's cognitive abilities.\n\nWhile it is known that President Trump has a history of high cholesterol and takes a small dose of cholesterol-lowering medication, there appear to be no other medical findings of concern. The cognitive ability tests, which measure general intelligence and can detect declines in function, were also part of the examination.\n\nThe president's high score on the cognitive test has put to rest any speculation about his mental fitness. The transparency of the press conference and the amount of information disclosed is commendable. The medical team's recommendations for diet and exercise are the only prescriptions necessary for the president's health.\n\nThis comprehensive health assessment should serve to dispel any doubts about President Trump's physical and mental fitness for office. The White House medical team's assessment of the president does him justice, and their recommendations for a healthy lifestyle are a testament to their commitment to the president's well-being.",
    " Title: French Authorities Conduct Raid on Paris Suburb, Detain Eight and Thwart Potential Terror Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nParis, France (CNN) - French authorities conducted a raid on a suspected hideout of the alleged mastermind behind last week's deadly Paris attacks, resulting in eight detentions, two deaths, and potentially thwarted further bloodshed. The operation took place in the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, where authorities believe the suspected ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, may have been holed up on the third floor of an apartment building.\n\nAccording to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, the operation began at 4:20 a.m. Wednesday (10:20 p.m. ET Tuesday) with a large contingent of heavily armed French police. The exact whereabouts of Abaaoud during the raid are unknown. Some residents in the area reported seeing Abaaoud recently in the neighborhood and at a local mosque.\n\nInvestigators zeroed in on the building after intercepting phone conversations indicating that a relative of Abaaoud might be there. The operation was met with resistance from the start, including an armored door, a woman who detonated a suicide vest, and gunfire exchanged for about an hour. The French officers even used powerful munitions, which led to one floor of the building collapsing.\n\nThe violence produced rubble that included body parts, on which investigators are conducting DNA tests. Neither Abaaoud nor suspect Salah Abdeslam, for whom authorities have been hunting since the attacks, were among those detained in the operation, Molins said.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande described the violent back-and-forth as further proof that \"we are at war\" with ISIS. \"What the terrorists were targeting was what France represents,\" he said. \"This is what was attacked on the night of November 13.\"\n\nISIS has claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, the downing of a Russian passenger jet in Egypt, and a pair of suicide bombings in Beirut this month. France had already been part of the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS with airstrikes, but the country has stepped up its efforts since the series of shootings and explosions in Paris last week, which killed 129 people.\n\nHollande has proposed extending France's state of emergency for three more months, a measure that gives authorities greater powers in conducting searches, holding people, and dissolving certain groups. To go after the Islamist extremist group, the French President also said he would appeal to world leaders, including meeting next week with U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who have been at odds on what to do in Syria.\n\nWhoever was inside the Saint-Denis apartment on Wednesday appeared to be \"prepared to act\" in possibly another attack, Molins said, noting their weaponry, structured organization, and determination.\n\nThe raid involved 110 police swarming the diverse, working-class area that is home to the Stade de France sports stadium, where three suicide bombings took place days earlier. The operation began with a raid on an apartment that had been under surveillance since Tuesday, a Paris police source said.\n\nTelephone communications on a wiretap by French and Belgian security agencies indicated a woman at the residence was Abaaoud's cousin, a Belgian counterterrorism official told CNN. That raid led them to another apartment on the same street. Molins described it as a complex operation. For almost an hour, he said, there was uninterrupted gunfire as police tried to get into the apartment.\n\nThe violent standoff left residents in the area, already shaken by last week's attacks, startled and scared. \"We could see the bullets,\" a woman, who identified herself only as Sabrine, told CNN affiliate France 2. \"We could feel the building shaking.\"\n\nThree people in the Saint-Denis building itself, including one with a bullet wound in the arm, are among the eight detained, according to Molins. The others include the person who loaned the apartment to the suspected terrorists and his friend. Two of the eight held were hospitalized, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told France Info radio.\n\nSaadana Aymen, a 29-year-old who lives one street down, couldn't believe what was happening in his neighborhood. \"When you think of Saint-Denis, you don't think of terrorists,\" he told CNN. \"I'm shocked! Why would the terrorists pick this neighborhood?\"\n\nThat wasn't the only place where French authorities fanned out Tuesday night into Wednesday as they worked to find suspects tied to the attacks and cracked down on security. The Interior Ministry announced 118 searches led to the detention of at least 25 people, the confiscation of 34 weapons, and the discovery of illicit drugs in 16 instances. In recent days, hundreds of similar operations have been conducted, the ministry said, resulting in 64 people being held and 118 put under house arrest.\n\nAuthorities have not provided details about the arrests or said what connection they could have to Friday's attacks. Molins said investigators are working to piece together where terrorists were in the days and hours leading up to the attacks\u2014and with whom they had contact.\n\nThey've encountered at least one piece of evidence that could help them in their search: One of the attacker's cell phones was found in a trash bin outside the Bataclan theater, where most of Friday's victims were gunned down. A message on the phone, according to Molins, said, \"Here we go, it's starting.\"\n\nAuthorities are trying to determine who the message was sent to, he said. They're still trying to determine whether the suspected ringleader in the attack is still on the run, or whether his remains were found in the rubble.",
    " Title: \"2020 Presidential Election: The Role of the 'Haters Demographic' in a Tight Race\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election, the group of voters who dislike both major-party candidates could play a significant role in determining the winner. Unlike in 2016, this could potentially be disadvantageous for incumbent President Donald Trump, according to a new Morning Consult poll.\n\nFour years ago, in a contest between two of the least-liked presidential nominees in history, Trump benefited from the number of voters who found him slightly less detestable than Hillary Clinton. However, the new poll suggests that Trump is not faring as well with the so-called 'haters demographic' this time around. Voters who hold unfavorable views of both Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden are more likely to vote for the former vice president than for the incumbent.\n\nExit polling on Election Day 2016 showed that voters who did not like either major party candidate ended up backing Trump over Hillary Clinton by a 17-point margin. With less than four months to go until Election Day 2020, Morning Consult's new poll shows Biden with a 29-point lead with the same group. Among the 43 percent who say they are undecided, Biden has a 19-point lead when they are forced to make a choice.\n\nThe group also feels more strongly about Trump than it does about Biden: 66 percent saying they have very unfavorable views of the president, while only 40 percent say the same about Biden. This is only looking at voters who say they have unfavorable views of both.\n\nThe influence that the 'haters demographic' could have on the election depends on several factors.\n\nFirst, due to the Electoral College, there is a geographic limitation on how much of a role voter anger can play. No matter how much a Californian might hate Joe Biden, California is going to be a blue state.\n\nSecond, like all polls that attempt to organize individuals into groups, this one can be a bit fuzzy around the edges. There are people out there who might say they dislike both candidates but are already fairly certain of how they will vote. Many conservatives, for example, might have voted for Trump in 2016 not because they particularly liked him but because they wanted a Republican president to pick judges. That demonstrates that some voters are motivated by more than their personal feelings towards the two candidates.\n\nThird, the role of third parties should also be considered. The abysmal approval ratings for Trump and Clinton in 2016 likely contributed to the record-shattering number of votes received that year by former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee.\n\nFew observers think that this year's Libertarian ticket\u2014led by the Clemson psychologist Jo Jorgensen\u2014will match Johnson's performance. However, the Morning Consult poll did not include any third-party candidates, so it may have a blind spot when it comes to whether members of the so-called 'haters demographic' might refuse to vote for both Trump and Biden. Some might simply stay home; others might try to find an alternative candidate they actually like.\n\nWith negative partisanship driving so much of American politics these days\u2014particularly on cable news and social media\u2014it should not be too surprising that voters with a negative view of both Trump and Biden are likely to decide the election. And with more than 100 days to go before the polls close, both candidates will have ample opportunities to add to that demographic.",
    " Title: Mitt Romney Announces Senate Bid in Utah, Promises Fiscal Responsibility and Moderate Stance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tweet on Friday, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney announced his intention to run for the U.S. Senate seat in Utah, vacated by the retiring Orrin Hatch. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, is considered a heavy favorite for the seat.\n\nRomney's tweet read, \"I am running for United States Senate to serve the people of Utah and bring Utah's values to Washington.\"\n\nIf elected, Romney, who has been a vocal critic of President Trump, could potentially cause challenges for the administration from across the street in the U.S. Capitol. Romney has deep ties to Utah, having attended Brigham Young University in Provo and played a significant role in turning around the scandal-plagued 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City after moving to the state following his 2012 presidential campaign loss.\n\nA video message posted on Twitter on Friday showcases Romney's Olympics background and offers voters an early glimpse of his platform. In the video, Romney emphasizes fiscal responsibility, job creation, and a moderate approach to immigration, which appears to be a critique of current administration policies.\n\n\"Utah has a lot to teach the politicians in Washington,\" Romney says in the video. \"Utah has balanced its budgets. Washington is buried in debt. Utah exports more abroad than it imports. Washington has that backwards. Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world. Washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion.\"\n\nThe announcement was anticipated, although it was delayed following Wednesday's mass shooting at a Florida high school. Utah Republican Party Chairman Rob Anderson earlier this week criticized Romney, stating, \"Mitt Romney does not live here, his kids were not born here, he does not shop here.\" Anderson later apologized for his remarks, acknowledging that they came across as disparaging and unsupportive.\n\nDespite Romney's past criticisms of President Trump, Democrats attempted to portray the two as ideologically aligned. Democratic National Committee spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement, \"While Mitt Romney desperately wants to separate himself from the extremism of the current administration, the basic policies of Trump's GOP \u2013 whether it's tax cuts for the rich or reversing the progress of the ACA \u2013 were his before they were Donald Trump's.\"\n\nPatel continued, \"Utah deserves a Senator who will expand opportunities and fight to improve the lives of everyone, not another multi-millionaire looking out for himself, his rich neighbors, and the special interests.\"\n\nRomney reportedly reached out to Anderson regarding the chairman's comments and accepted his apology. Anderson assured that he would treat all candidates equally and fairly in the upcoming primary election.",
    " Title: Ongoing Debate Surrounding the Future of Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility\n\n Article:\n\n The ongoing debate surrounding the future of the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, colloquially known as \"Gitmo,\" continues to escalate, with pressure mounting for its closure. However, the challenge lies in determining the fate of the prisoners currently held within its walls.\n\n President Barack Obama, who pledged to shut down the aging and deteriorating prison in 2009, signed an executive order with the intention of closing it within a year. Yet, Gitmo remains operational, housing 149 prisoners, with as many as 50 considered too dangerous for release by the administration. The Southern Command requested $200 million in improvements last year, but this request was denied by the Pentagon.\n\n General John F. Kelly, head of the U.S. Southern Command, which includes Joint Task Force Guantanamo, told the New York Times that the prison is \"a long way from being closed.\" He added, \"Obviously the president is trying hard, he's got people trying hard to get countries to take them, but at the end of the day, it's going to take congressional action.\"\n\n House Republicans have voted to ban the transfer of prisoners, citing the Obama administration's alleged violation of law when five Taliban prisoners were freed in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in May without sufficient notification to Congress. Rep. Howard \"Buck\" McKeon, California Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told the Times, \"I don't see any support in the House for relaxing the current restrictions, or backing off our ban, in light of the president's recent violation of the law.\"\n\n An attempt to transfer six detainees to Uruguay fell through at the last minute when Uruguayan President Jose Mujica withdrew from the deal. Meanwhile, the Times reports that leaking ceilings, buckling floors, and inadequate medical facilities cause constant problems at the aging prison.\n\n Approximately 6,000 service members and staff work at the prison complex, with taxpayer expense estimated at about $413 million in 2014, or about $3 million per prisoner per year. If the prisoners were housed in a U.S. federal penitentiary, costs would drop to about $30,280 per prisoner per year.\n\n Rear Adm. Kyle Kozad, who heads the prison task force, told the Times, \"We are forced to at least forecast so that we're prepared if this detention facility is open two years from now, 12 years from now, 22 years from now, so that we're prepared to be able to continue to do the mission.\"\n\n The future of Gitmo remains uncertain, with the ongoing debate highlighting the complexities and challenges associated with its closure and the disposition of its prisoners.",
    " Title: The Supreme Court's Trivial Pursuit: Navigating the Complexities of the Death Penalty\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debates within the Supreme Court regarding the death penalty have been portrayed as a heated feud, but a closer examination reveals a more nuanced approach. Rather than fundamentally challenging the constitutionality of capital punishment, the justices are, in essence, nibbling around the edges.\n\nThe issue of the death penalty has sparked intense debate, with some advocating for its abolition. However, their efforts to achieve this goal through questionable legal maneuvers, such as jurispretext, are misguided. The U.S. Constitution, in the Fifth and Eighth Amendments, explicitly acknowledges and places limitations on capital punishment.\n\nCurrent Supreme Court actions on the death penalty are largely trivial, focusing on specific details such as the presence of non-Christian or non-Muslim chaplains in the death chamber, or the pain a prisoner might experience during lethal injection due to a rare disease. These cases, while significant in their own right, do not address the broader question of the constitutionality of capital punishment.\n\nHistorically, the Supreme Court has made controversial decisions regarding the death penalty, such as the intellectually and legally incoherent Furman case, which imposed a national moratorium on executions. However, many arguments against the death penalty, such as the irreversibility of the punishment or the perceived bias in its application, are often based on flawed premises.\n\nThe fundamental obstacle to arguments against capital punishment is not its inherent injustice, but rather its uneven application and the need for procedural reform. The death penalty is a rare punishment, applied within a legal system that provides the accused with representation, procedural openness, a generous appellate process, and more.\n\nWhile there are valid arguments against the death penalty, such as its potential to add more violence and horror to society, these are not questions for the Supreme Court. Instead, they are matters for Congress and the states, which have the power to end the practice of capital punishment whenever they choose.\n\nIn conclusion, the Supreme Court's current actions regarding the death penalty are largely focused on specific, trivial cases rather than addressing the broader constitutional questions. It may be more effective and principled to end capital punishment through legislative action rather than through legal pretext.",
    " Title: Defense Secretary Mattis Stresses U.S. Commitment to Asia-Pacific Allies, Urges Cooperation with China and North Korea\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis emphasized the urgent need to address the nuclear threat posed by North Korea and criticized both North Korea and China for their actions in the South China Sea.\n\nMattis described North Korea as an \"urgent military threat\" and called for diplomatic, economic, and other means to be exhausted to prevent a nuclear arms race in violation of United Nations restrictions on North Korea's activities. He also expressed hope that China, a key player in the region, would ultimately see North Korea's regime as a liability rather than an asset and pressure Pyongyang to halt its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nRegarding China, Mattis criticized Beijing's \"indisputable militarization\" of artificial islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea, stating that the U.S. opposes countries that militarize artificial islands and enforce excessive maritime claims unsupported by international law. He emphasized that the U.S. is committed to working with its global partners to maintain peace and stability in the region.\n\nRep. Mac Thornberry, a Republican from Texas and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, praised Mattis for effectively stressing the U.S. commitment to allies in the Asia-Pacific region. Thornberry, who led a bipartisan congressional delegation on an Asia tour, attended the Singapore conference.\n\nMattis' speech struck a positive and hopeful tone, emphasizing the potential for cooperation and peace in the region. He acknowledged the competition between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies, but stressed that conflict is not inevitable. Mattis also highlighted the long record of human rights abuses by the North Korean regime, including the murder of diplomats, kidnapping, and criminal activity.\n\nThe U.S. has approximately 28,500 troops permanently based in South Korea, a defense treaty ally. Mattis' speech underscores the Trump administration's priority of nurturing and strengthening alliances and partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region.",
    " Title: Understanding National Debt: Factors, Implications, and Global Comparisons\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of economic indicators, national debt stands as a significant measure of a country's fiscal health. The level of national debt, when compared to other factors such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), offers valuable insights into a nation's financial status.\n\nJeffrey Frankel, an economics professor at Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, emphasizes the importance of considering the growth rate of national debt in relation to GDP. According to Dr. Frankel, a stable situation arises when national debt is decreasing as a share of GDP.\n\nThe capacity for a country to manage debt depends on a multitude of factors. Rising debt can cause economic strain, as a larger portion of government expenditures is allocated for interest payments. However, in certain circumstances, increased borrowing may be justified, such as during economic downturns, when the government might opt to increase spending as a stimulus, for instance, by investing in large-scale infrastructure projects.\n\nThe optimal level of debt for a given country, as explained by Nicolas V\u00e9ron of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, depends on its creditworthiness\u2014its ability to repay its debts.\n\nWhen comparing developed and developing countries, it is evident that developed countries hold significantly greater levels of national debt. This disparity is due to \"market discipline,\" as investors are less inclined to lend to emerging markets, perceiving them as riskier. As V\u00e9ron notes, \"The more creditworthy you are, the more you can borrow. It's true of individuals; it's true of countries.\"\n\nIn the United States, the national debt has been on the rise since the 1980s, currently nearing $20 trillion. While it is impossible to predict with certainty, most analysts expect President Trump's policies to result in increased national debt due to proposed tax cuts and spending increases.\n\nEurope's recent financial struggles have raised questions about the role national debt played in the 2009 crisis. Some analysts suggest that too much austerity was imposed, particularly in Greece, which had high debt levels before the crisis due to its emerging market-like features. The debate continues over whether austerity was necessary before 2008 or if it was imposed at the wrong time, exacerbating the economic downturn.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding national debt is crucial for evaluating a country's fiscal health and economic outlook. The relationship between national debt and GDP, a country's creditworthiness, and the role of national debt in economic crises are essential factors to consider when assessing a nation's financial stability.",
    " Title: Colorado Pioneers Transparency in Healthcare Prices, Aiming to Simplify Cost Comparisons\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the digital age, finding a new coffee maker is as simple as typing \"shop coffee maker\" into a browser, with a plethora of models, prices, and customer reviews at one's fingertips. However, the process of shopping for a less popular item, such as a colonoscopy, can be significantly more challenging. Actual prices for the procedure are difficult to find, and there is a wide range in cost from one clinic to another, as noted by Bob Kershner, who works for a nonprofit called the Colorado Health Institute (CIVHC).\n\n\"You see the range is from $2,800 down to just about $400,\" Kershner said, pointing to a computer screen displaying some colonoscopy prices in Denver.\n\nCIVHC is part of a growing movement to make health care prices publicly available in Colorado. Edie Sonn, the organization's CEO, emphasizes that knowledge is power, and that people have had little information about the actual cost of health care services. A database that includes all health claims in a particular state, she explains, provides the information necessary for consumers to become empowered.\n\nColorado is one of eleven states that are starting to make public a significant amount of health care prices. This process has taken years, with the first step being the creation of an \"all payer claims database.\" This database aims to collect a copy of every receipt for a health care service in a given state. Since doctors and hospitals generally do not disclose prices beforehand, the best way to determine the price is to gather receipts from the parties that pay the bills: insurance companies, Medicaid, and Medicare, primarily.\n\nThe more such information is made public, Sonn says, the more people will \"vote with their feet\" and migrate away from high-cost providers. However, turning this information about price from eye-crossing rows in a spreadsheet into consumer-friendly formats is a challenging task. Colorado's effort has taken years, with laws needing to be passed to get insurance companies to send in their claims data (the receipts for what they're paying) and sorting through all the information being a lot tougher than organizing a pile of paper receipts in a shoebox.\n\n\"Claims data is dirty,\" says Sonn. \"It's really dirty. It takes a lot of scrubbing to make sense of it. It's complicated, time-consuming, and expensive.\"\n\nColorado has had funding to do that from private grants, but those are drying up. In order to keep on making basic price information accessible to the public for free, the state wants to sell more complicated, custom data reports to businesses within the health industry.\n\nThere is a growing market for such reports, says Dr. David Ehrenberger, the chief medical officer for Avista Adventist hospital, outside Denver. He would like to see reports that show not just how much his competitors are charging, but also whether their patients have more or fewer complications. That would give him better negotiating power with big insurance companies.\n\n\"The insurance industry still has a dramatic advantage over, particularly, smaller physician groups and smaller health care organizations,\" Ehrenberger says. \"There's not a level playing field there.\"\n\nThis is because big insurance companies pay bills at hospitals all over the state, so they have a broad view of how much everybody charges for procedures, and of details such as complication rates. Individual hospitals only know their own prices. It's as if only customers could get a list of prices for different coffee makers, but Cuisinart and Mr. Coffee could not, so they would not know if they were asking too much or too little for their coffee makers. The better view Ehrenberger can get of the entire marketplace for health care services, the better he can set prices.\n\n\"What we want to do is be able to have the data that shows, unequivocally, that we can provide a better quality product\u2014and [at] a cost they can afford,\" he says.\n\nHowever, there is a glitch. In order to get the kinds of reports Ehrenberger and other health care providers want, they have to include price information from all payers, and one of the biggest is Medicare\u2014it pays about a fifth of all health care bills in Colorado. At the moment, Edie Sonn explains, they can not use that Medicare data in any of the custom reports they want to sell.\n\n\"Current federal law restricts what we can do with that Medicare data,\" she says. \"The only thing you can use their data for is public reporting.\"\n\nSonn's organization and others like it have found support on Capitol Hill to let them sell Medicare data. It turns out that Democrats and Republicans agree that price transparency is key to controlling costs. A measure that would make that change is now part of a bigger Medicare bill (find it in section 107) working its way through Congress. If it passes, Colorado will be one step closer to making shopping for health care as easy as shopping for a coffee maker.\n\nThis story is part of a partnership between NPR and Kaiser Health News.",
    " Title: Young Adult Uninsured Rates Drop Significantly in 2011, Attributed to Affordable Care Act's Dependent Coverage Provision\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A new report released on Monday reveals a substantial decrease in the number of young adults without health insurance in 2011, marking the largest annual decline for any age group since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began collecting data in 1997.\n\nThe data, drawn from a federal survey of approximately 35,000 households, indicates that the share of young adults aged 19 to 25 without health insurance dropped from 33.9% in 2010 to 27.9% in 2011, a decrease of about 1.6 million uninsured individuals. For the age group of 26 to 35 years old, the share of the uninsured slightly increased, a trend that study author Matthew Broaddus, a research analyst at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, attributes to the Affordable Care Act's influence on the younger age group.\n\nThe dependents' provision of the Affordable Care Act, which allows children to remain on their parents' insurance policies until their 26th birthday, is the primary explanation for the decrease in uninsured young adults, according to Broaddus and health care policy expert Joseph Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Antos notes that young people have been disproportionately affected by the economic recession and would have been expected to be less likely to be insured.\n\nThe dependents' provision of the health care law took effect in September 2010, and the number of uninsured young adults decreased that year as well, though by a smaller amount. Obama administration officials have pointed to this initial drop as evidence that the law, which was broadly opposed by Republicans, was having an effect.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Criticize Profit-Driven Enterprises During Debates\n\nArticle:\n\nThe opening round of the Democratic presidential debates has concluded, with a recurring theme emerging: the criticism of profit-driven enterprises. Several Democratic candidates expressed concern over the perceived dominance of profit over people's well-being.\n\nHere is a compilation of instances where profit was demonized during the debates:\n\n- Senator Elizabeth Warren argued that the current industrial policy in the United States has allowed large corporations to operate without regulation, prioritizing profits over people. She cited the practice of moving jobs overseas to save costs as a prime example.\n\n- Senator Bernie Sanders, in discussing healthcare, criticized the pharmaceutical and insurance industries for profiteering off the pain of American citizens. He highlighted the $23 billion in profits made by insurance companies in 2019, excluding executive compensation and lobbying expenses.\n\n- Senator Amy Klobuchar expressed her disapproval of private prisons, stating that they profit from incarceration, which she finds repugnant.\n\n- Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro emphasized the need to distinguish between capitalism and greed, suggesting that the issue at hand is when corporations prioritize profits over people.\n\n- Senator Kirsten Gillibrand advocated for universal healthcare as a right and not a privilege, proposing competition with insurance companies to achieve this goal. She criticized the insurance industry for prioritizing profits over people.\n\n- Mayor Pete Buttigieg, in a more subtle manner, implied the need for a shift in the healthcare system's focus from profits to providing quality care to all in a cost-effective manner.\n\n- Senator Cory Booker also touched upon the issue, stating that the current healthcare system's function is to make billions in profits for insurance companies, rather than providing quality care to all.\n\nThe candidates' statements suggest a shared concern over the perceived dominance of profit over people's well-being in various sectors, particularly healthcare and incarceration. The debates seem to indicate a shift in the Democratic party's focus towards prioritizing people over profits.",
    " Title: A Comparative Analysis of Presidential Policies: Obama vs. Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the presidencies of Barack Obama and Donald Trump have been marked by stark contrasts, particularly in foreign policy. This article aims to provide a neutral, factual, and informative analysis of the similarities and differences between the two administrations, focusing on their immigration policies, executive powers, and foreign interventions.\n\n-Start of Article-\n\nOne of the most intriguing phenomena of the Trump era is the selective memory of Obama's executive powers by the Democratic party. This amnesia, as some might call it, has led to a continuous portrayal of the Democrats as if they have just stepped off the Washington turnip wagon when Trump takes actions that were also taken during Obama's tenure.\n\nFor instance, the debate over immigration policies has seen Democrats forgetting that Obama deported more immigrants than Trump. The controversial cages on the southern border, a contentious issue during Trump's presidency, were built during Obama's administration.\n\nIn terms of executive powers, Trump's defiance of congressional subpoenas has been a point of contention. However, this is a practice that was also seen during Obama's administration, with his Attorney General, Eric Holder, being held in contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas related to the Fast and Furious scandal.\n\nThe Obama administration also defied congressional oversight on at least eight occasions, preventing people from testifying, a practice that seems familiar in the current administration.\n\nWhen Trump announced his \"America First\" policy during his inaugural, Democrats seemed to take it literally, forgetting that Obama had also sent pallets of cash to Iran, a move that is now being criticized.\n\nIn the realm of foreign policy, Trump's decision to authorize a drone strike that killed Iranian terrorist Qassem Soleimani has been met with criticism for lack of notification and consent. However, it is important to note that Obama authorized at least 2,800 drone strikes in Iraq and Syria without congressional approval.\n\nObama's drone strike policy was so extensive that, by his third year in office, he had approved the killings of twice as many suspected terrorists as had ever been imprisoned in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. This is a stark contrast to the current narrative that Trump's actions are unprecedented.\n\nIn conclusion, the political landscape of the United States has seen a shift in foreign policy under Trump's presidency. While the outcome of these decisions remains uncertain, it is clear that Trump's decision to take out the world's most notorious terrorist, Qassem Soleimani, was a bold choice that sent a strong message.\n\nWhether one agrees with Trump's policies or not, it is crucial to remember the past and understand the context in which these decisions were made. As the 2020 election approaches, it is essential to approach political discourse with a nuanced understanding of the past and present, rather than selective memory or partisan disingenuousness.\n\n-End of Article-",
    " Title: Controversial Billboard Ad Featuring Firearms Sparks Debate in Chicago\n\nArticle:\n\nA billboard campaign by Slide Fire, a firearms parts manufacturer based in Texas, has sparked controversy in Chicago, with the ad depicting \"assault rifles\" as being as American as apple pie and baseball. The ad, which features a modern sporting rifle under the phrase \"Pure American\" alongside images of a baseball glove and a pie, has been criticized by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, a gun-control group.\n\nNicole Chen, the head of the gun-control group's Illinois chapter, expressed her disapproval of the ad, stating, \"I was shocked that the ad removes'mom' from the idiom 'as American as baseball, apple pie, and mom,' and replaces it with an assault rifle.\" She added, \"It's particularly upsetting that children in Chicago, a city that has struggled horribly with gun violence, are being exposed to such a harmful message.\"\n\nSlide Fire deliberately chose Chicago for one of its billboards due to the city's high crime rate and strict gun-control laws. Laura Shackelford, the chief executive manager of Slide Fire, explained, \"Chicago is the number one place in the country that shows gun laws don't work.\" She continued, \"We specifically put the ad up there to show that a firearm is normal Americana. We have to stop allowing a small group of anti-gun people to dictate how we think about guns.\"\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents firearms manufacturers, pointed out that the modern sporting rifle depicted is not an \"assault rifle.\" Lawrence Keane, the foundation's general counsel, stated, \"The modern sporting rifle depicted is by definition not an 'assault rifle.' We wish anti-gun groups wouldn't purposely mislead the public when they exercise their right to free speech.\"\n\nSlide Fire manufactures the Slide Stock, a replacement stock on a rifle that allows for faster shooting. The slide stock allows the user to \"bump fire\" from the shoulder, using the recoil of the firearm to pull the trigger faster. The feature has been controversial, with gun-control advocates such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein wrongly stating that it converts a semi-automatic gun into an automatic one.\n\nHowever, Ms. Shackelford stated that the \"Pure American\" campaign is more about promoting Second Amendment rights than their product. \"We are all law-abiding citizens who are sick of being told that it's abnormal or scary to own a firearm,\" she said. \"These gun-control groups are not making anyone safer, but just stoking irrational fears of the unknown.\"\n\nMs. Shackelford also pointed out that guns are older than either baseball or apple pies, and that firearms are the reason we are American citizens today. \"Firearms are the reason we are American citizens today,\" she said. \"And it's why the Constitution includes the Second Amendment.\"\n\nThe debate over the billboard ad highlights the ongoing tension between gun rights advocates and gun-control groups, with each side presenting their perspectives on the role of firearms in American society. The First Amendment's protection of free speech remains a central issue in the ongoing debate.",
    " Title: Military Rights Group Calls for Removal of Nazi-Symbol-Inscribed Headstones in Veterans' Cemetery\n\nArticle:\n\nA nonprofit civil rights organization, the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF), has requested the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to remove marble headstones inscribed with Nazi iconography and a phrase honoring Adolf Hitler at the graves of two German prisoners of war in the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery in San Antonio.\n\nThe headstones, which bear the soldiers' names, dates of birth, and death, also feature a swastika within an iron cross - an award for valor - and the phrase, \"He died far from his home for the F\u00fchrer, people, and fatherland.\" \"The F\u00fchrer\" is a title Hitler gave himself.\n\nMikey Weinstein, chair of the MRFF, was alerted to the headstones by a former active-duty senior officer in the U.S. military. Weinstein, who is Jewish, shared photographs of the headstones with the media. In a letter to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, Weinstein demanded that the department \"immediately replace the gravestones of all German military personnel interred in V.A. National Cemeteries\" and ensure that no Nazi-era symbols remain in U.S. military graveyards.\n\n\"Indeed, VA Secretary Wilkie must first timely explain why any such former enemy military personnel are even buried in V.A. national cemeteries in the first place alongside our honored deceased American veterans,\" Weinstein said.\n\nLes Melnyk, the head of public affairs and outreach for the VA National Cemetery Administration, told the media in an email that the agency \"will continue to preserve these headstones, like every past administration has.\" It is not immediately clear whether any past administration has fielded a similar call to remove the headstones.\n\nThe Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery is home to 133,154 American veterans, spouses, or their children. Its \"Section Z\" hosts the remains of 140 prisoners of war from World War II, 132 of which were German.\n\nBy the end of World War II, nearly half a million Axis prisoners of war were transferred to about 700 camps in the U.S. The vast majority were repatriated at the end of the war, but POWs who died in the U.S. were buried at their prisons and sometimes reinterred in national cemeteries when camps shut down.\n\nIt is unclear why the remains of these two POWs, both of whom died in 1943, were not repatriated nor why their gravestones were inscribed with Nazi iconography and given military distinction.\n\nThe former military officer who shared the photos - who is Jewish - saw the headstones when he was paying respects to his grandfather, an ambulance driver who fought against the Germans in World War II. His father was also enlisted, and his uncle and aunt are both buried at the same cemetery.\n\n\"There are Nazis here today, and they could gather around these symbols. You know, 'Here are the martyrs that died for our cause,'\" he told the media. \"It's an outrage.\"\n\nAlong with the German prisoners of war, the cemetery is home to four Italian, three Japanese, and one Austrian. Historical records show that the POWs were buried in Section Z starting in 1947, according to a 2012 article about the cemetery in a local San Antonio publication.\n\n\"When they first buried the PWs out there, the section they were in was about as far from the active part of the cemetery as you can get and still be in the cemetery,\" former Fort Sam Houston Museum director John Manguso told the paper. \"But, as time went on, the cemetery expanded out past where they're buried and so now they're about in the geographic center of it.\"\n\nThe VA routinely changes out headstones if appropriately requested, such as for errors in spelling or dates. The military also keeps a registry of Available Emblems of Belief for Placement on Government Headstones and Markers, and neither the iron cross nor the swastika appear on the official list.\n\n\"Somebody had to make a decision putting these Nazi symbols and that inscription honoring Adolf Hitler on those headstones,\" said the retired senior officer, who also had family members among the 6 million Jewish people murdered in the Holocaust. \"Somebody had to do it.\"\n\nDisplays of white supremacy and anti-Semitism in the U.S. increased dramatically following Trump's ascension to the presidency. Among them was the 2018 massacre at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue, which was the deadliest anti-Semitic terrorist attack in U.S. history. But white supremacism has long nested in American culture, including in the military.\n\nPollsters found in 2017 that nearly one in four armed service members - and more than 40 percent of people of color in uniform - had encountered someone promoting white nationalism in the military. Republicans in Congress quietly removed the term \"white nationalist\" from a defense bill amendment aimed at keeping white nationalists out of the military last year, according to Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.\n\nThe retired military officer pointed out that the remains of the Nazi officers hanged at the Nuremberg trials were cremated and tossed into the Iscar River, so their resting places would not be shrines or destinations for Nazi pilgrims. Weinstein's group is now calling on the VA to apologize - and explain why it has used taxpayer money to maintain the gravestones.\n\n\"In light of the shocking and inexcusable existence of these Nazi-adorned gravesites in V.A. National Cemeteries, MRFF demands that you, Secretary Wilkie, issue an immediate and heartfelt apology to all United States veterans and their families,\" he wrote in a statement to the department.\n\nYou can read Melnyk's statement on behalf of the VA National Cemetery Administration below:\n\n\"The Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration (VA NCA) is committed to preserving the sacred memory of all veterans and their families. We are aware of the concerns regarding the headstones in question and are reviewing the matter. We will provide an update as soon as possible.\"",
    " Title: Millennials' Economic Struggles: A Look at Lower Labor Force Participation and Lack of Stock Investment\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent poll indicates a significant number of Americans believe it will be more challenging for millennials to achieve the American Dream of economic advancement. While this may be overly pessimistic, the early indicators of young people's economic status and financial habits are indeed concerning.\n\nOne troubling sign is the declining labor force participation rate among individuals aged 18 to 24, which is now near a 50-year low at 65%. This means that if you are 22 and not working, you are dependent, not independent. Moreover, over half of 18- to 23-year-olds live with their parents, leading to questions about when they might leave home.\n\nAnother concerning trend is the low rate of stock ownership among young people. According to the latest data from the Federal Reserve, only 7% of households headed by those under 35 years old directly own stock. This is a stark contrast to the 30% rate recorded in 1963 when the survey was first conducted.\n\nInterestingly, stock market participation has decreased for nearly every age group over the past decade. However, this is ironic because since 2008, the stock market indexes have more than doubled. This suggests that people may have sold during the 2008 panic and have yet to re-enter the market.\n\nInvesting, particularly in stocks, is often seen as a long-term strategy for building wealth and capital. Known as \"stocks for the long run,\" this approach, as explained by investment guru Jeremy Siegel, is the single best way to accumulate wealth over time. The average real rate of return of stocks since the late-19th century has been 6%, which would make $1 invested at age 18 worth more than $15 at age 65. With a real return of 9% per year, each $1 grows to more than $50 during those 47 years.\n\nThe reasons for the low rate of stock investment among young people are varied. One factor is the lingering psychological trauma of the 2001 tech and 2008 broad market collapses. Another issue is the high levels of student loan debt, which leaves many young people with limited funds for savings and investment.\n\nPerhaps the most significant issue for young workers is the high taxes they pay through the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) payroll tax. After paying these taxes, many young workers have little disposable income left for investment after covering necessities. Worse, the young do not receive a return on this money, as the government spends it as soon as it is received.\n\nEconomist Peter Ferrara of the Heartland Institute argues in his new book, \"Power to the People,\" that the average-income young American would have a substantial nest egg if they invested their payroll tax dollars in an index fund of all stocks. This would eliminate the retirement crisis for millennials and create a retirement bonanza instead.\n\nFerrara demonstrates that the average two-earner household earns about 1% per year on the FICA taxes they pay, given the benefits they are scheduled to receive. A lifetime single worker, however, gets a dismal return of less than 0.5% from Social Security. These workers would be better off saving their payroll tax dollars under a mattress.\n\nAmerica should be about owning a piece of the rock, about allowing every worker to have equity and share in the returns to capital. The new left-leaning argument is that equity returns rise faster than wages. If this is true, it is essential to let more poor and middle-class workers own equities.\n\nIf only the wealthiest top 10% of Americans own stock directly, the wealth gap between rich and poor is likely to widen. Economist David Malpass points out in a recent wealth analysis that the value of all U.S. household assets is $99 trillion, up more than 5% over the last year. However, he also finds that \"most of this wealth is concentrated with the wealthy,\" and this is partly because the middle class and young have dropped out of the market.\n\nIn conclusion, it is crucial for millennials to start investing early and regularly to secure their financial future. By setting aside $100 a month for investing, young people can contribute to their and America's future prosperity.",
    " Title: Trump Transition Team Accuses Special Counsel of Unlawfully Obtaining Emails\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The legal team for U.S. President Donald Trump's transition to the White House has accused the special counsel investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election of unlawfully obtaining tens of thousands of emails from the General Services Administration (GSA), a government agency.\n\nIn a letter to congressional committees, Kory Langhofer, counsel to the transition team known as Trump for America, Inc. (TFA), stated that career staff members at the GSA had improperly provided the special counsel's office with TFA's private materials, including privileged communications.\n\nThe materials included \"tens of thousands of emails,\" according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. The Trump team used facilities of the GSA, which helps manage the U.S. government bureaucracy, in the period between Trump's November presidential election victory and his inauguration in January.\n\nThe Trump team's accusation adds to the growing friction between the president's supporters and Mueller's office as it investigates whether Russia interfered in the election and if Trump or anyone on his team colluded with Moscow.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, \"We continue to cooperate fully with the special counsel and expect this process to wrap up soon.\"\n\nThe special counsel's office waved off the transition team's complaint. \"When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner's consent or appropriate criminal process,\" said Peter Carr, spokesman for the special counsel's office.\n\nThe GSA did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nDemocrats say there is a wide-ranging effort by the president's allies on Capitol Hill and in some media outlets to discredit Mueller's investigation. Trump himself has loudly declared Mueller's effort a waste of time.\n\nOn Friday, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said he fears the committee's Republican majority intends to close its investigation of the topic prematurely. Some Republicans have argued that Mueller is biased against Trump and should be fired.\n\nLanghofer's letter was sent to the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. It asked for Congress to act immediately \"to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives.\"\n\nThe letter said Mueller's office obtained the emails despite the fact that it was aware the GSA did not own or control the records. It said the special counsel's office has \"extensively used the materials in question, including portions that are susceptible to claims of privilege\" without notifying the Trump for America team.\n\nThe FBI had requested the materials from GSA staff on Aug. 23, asking for copies of the emails, laptops, cell phones, and other materials associated with nine members of the Trump transition team responsible for national security and policy matters, the letter said. The FBI requested the materials of four additional senior members of the Trump transition team on Aug. 30, it added.\n\nLanghofer argued that, while such transition teams are involved in executive functions, they are considered private, non-profit organizations whose records are private and not subject to presidential records laws.",
    " Title: Nevada and Idaho Same-Sex Couples Face Setbacks in Marriage License Issuance Amidst Supreme Court Rulings\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of conflicting court decisions, county clerks in Nevada and Idaho turned away same-sex couples eager to marry on Wednesday. The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling, which blocked partners in Idaho from picking up marriage licenses moments before they would have done so, added to the confusion.\n\nMary Baranovich, a plaintiff in a Nevada court challenge to the state's gay marriage ban with Beverly Sevcik, her partner of 43 years, expressed her frustration, stating, \"I think I have whiplash.\" A 9th Circuit ruling late Tuesday cleared the way for Idaho and Nevada to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses, but a ruling by Justice Anthony Kennedy brought plans to a halt in both states.\n\nLater, Kennedy clarified that the stay he approved applied only to Idaho, but Nevada officials wanted to wait for more clear direction. In Idaho, hopeful couples gathered early at courthouses to apply for marriage licenses. However, at 8:01 a.m., Ada County Clerk Chris Rich handed the Supreme Court memo to a lawyer and informed a small crowd of gay couples and their supporters, \"We're not issuing same-sex marriage licenses today.\"\n\nThe announcement left the room in stunned silence, except for a small child asking over and over, \"Why?\" Amber Beierle, one of the affected couples, shared her experience, stating, \"We were past the metal detectors, we were just a few feet away from the clerk. And then our attorney was handed a one-page document. Apparently, it was Justice Kennedy telling us, No.\"\n\nBeierle recounted the toughest moment as when she called her mother, who was driving into town to help celebrate. \"There's just something about hearing your mom's voice that makes everything seem a little more real,\" she said. Beierle began to choke up on the phone as she tried to fight back tears. She and her partner, Rachael Beierle, were not going to give up their fight, but it was an especially bitter moment since they had never been this close to getting married before.\n\nIn Las Vegas, wedding chapels had photographers ready to capture two brides in white dresses while ordained Elvis impersonators practiced their lines. At several points throughout the day, couples thought marriages might begin. However, as courts began to close, Diana Alba, the Clark County clerk, said no one in the state would be issuing marriage licenses Wednesday, and she didn't know when they might begin. \"I wish I knew a date,\" she said.\n\nTara Traynor and her fianc\u00e9e, Cathy Grimes, were among those waiting at the Clark County Marriage License Bureau, checking their phones for court developments and letting straight couples cut in front of them while they waited for the legal OK to get a license themselves. \"It's kind of disheartening,\" Traynor said. \"We wait and wait, and we're hopeful.\"\n\nTraynor and Grimes have been together for eight years and were among the first couples to register as domestic partners in Nevada. They went straight to the bureau when they thought they could get a license. \"We wanted to be a part of history,\" Traynor said.\n\nThe ongoing legal battle for same-sex couples in Idaho and Nevada highlights the ongoing struggle for marriage equality in the United States, with the Supreme Court's decision on Monday making gay marriage legal in about 30 states, but the how and when that would happen remains in doubt. In South Carolina, for example, a judge issued a license for a handful of gay couples, but no one got married as the state's attorney general asked the Supreme Court for a stay.",
    " Title: Andrew Gillum Concedes Florida Governor Race to Ron DeSantis, Vows to Continue Advocating for Change\n\nIn a concession speech posted on his Facebook page Saturday night, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum officially acknowledged Republican Ron DeSantis as the winner of the Florida governor's race. Gillum, who initially conceded on election night but later retracted it, thanked his supporters and congratulated DeSantis.\n\n\"R. Jai and I wanted to take a moment to congratulate Mr. DeSantis on becoming the next governor of the great state of Florida,\" Gillum said.\n\nThe race went to a legally required recount, but after an initial machine recount, DeSantis still led Gillum by more than 30,000 votes. More than 8 million ballots went to a machine recount that ended Thursday afternoon. The final tally was 4,075,445 for DeSantis and 4,041,762 for Gillum.\n\nGillum said he and his wife wanted to ensure every vote had been counted, including those that were undervotes and overvotes.\n\n\"We wanted to make sure that every vote, including those that were undervotes and overvotes \u2014 as long as it was a legally cast vote \u2014 we wanted those votes to be counted,\" he said.\n\nLosing the race for the governor's mansion does not mean Gillum will stop working on behalf of Florida voters. He will end his four-year term as Tallahassee mayor later this month but said he would fight to update the state election system and advocate for the issues that matter to him and the more than 4 million people who voted for him.\n\n\"This was about creating the kind of change in this state that really allows for the voices of everyday people to show up again in our government, our state, and our communities,\" Gillum said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump offered praise on Twitter for Gillum, whom he had frequently attacked leading up to Election Day.\n\n\"Congratulations to Andrew Gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for Governor of the Great State of Florida. He will be a strong Democrat warrior long into the future \u2014 a force to reckon with!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nGillum said he has no plans of stepping out of the spotlight completely.\n\n\"Stay tuned. There is more to come. The fight for Florida continues,\" he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. Follow Ashley White on Twitter: @AshleyyDi.",
    " Title: Crossroads GPS Releases \"ObamaCareNado\" Video Criticizing Affordable Care Act\n\nIn a move that combines political satire with popular culture, the Karl Rove-backed Crossroads GPS has released a new online attack video titled \"ObamaCareNado.\" The video, which parodies the SyFy network's \"Sharknado,\" portrays the Affordable Care Act as a destructive tornado, symbolized by the \"ObamaCareNado.\"\n\nThe 47-second video, narrated in a schlock-stick style, depicts a series of tornadoes ripping through various scenes, bearing the faces of key Democratic figures such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and President Obama. The video's tagline reads, \"Nobody is safe from its wrath. Leaving a path of destruction through our economy.\"\n\nCrossroads GPS, one of the largest conservative political groups, has been vocal in their criticism of the Affordable Care Act, as well as other issues such as immigration reform and student loans. The organization spent $176 million in the 2012 federal elections, according to OpenSecrets.org.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans in the House of Representatives have been actively pursuing measures to postpone the individual and business mandates of the Affordable Care Act. On Wednesday, they passed a pair of bills that aim to delay these mandates, although neither bill is expected to progress in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nThe release of the \"ObamaCareNado\" video coincides with President Obama's major speech on Thursday, where he highlighted the success of the Affordable Care Act. He emphasized that affordable healthcare is a basic right for all Americans and reaffirmed his commitment to ensuring that every American receives the care they need at a price they can afford.\n\nA separate study released on Wednesday predicted a 50% drop in healthcare prices for New York residents when the health care law takes effect next year. This contrasts with the portrayal in the Crossroads GPS video, which depicts the Affordable Care Act as a destructive force.",
    " Title: Opinion: The Saddened Response to Jesse Jackson Jr.'s Downfall: A Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of political scandals, the case of Jesse Jackson Jr., the disgraced former Congressman, has been a topic of discussion for quite some time. His fall from grace, marked by the misuse of campaign funds and betrayal of public trust, has left many feeling a sense of contempt. However, a recent segment on 'Morning Joe' has sparked a debate, with some expressing a sense of sadness for Jackson Jr.'s downfall.\n\nJazz Shaw, in his analysis, questions the rationale behind this sentiment. He argues that the criminal act was caught, justice was served, and the system functioned as intended. The question, he poses, is why should this be considered a \"sad story\"?\n\nThe crux of Shaw's argument lies in the fact that Jackson Jr. stole nearly a million dollars from his district, a significant portion of which is comprised of individuals living below the poverty line. The question of empathy for Madoff, another high-profile criminal, is raised as a point of comparison.\n\nShaw contends that Jackson Jr. received the punishment he deserved, having betrayed the public's trust. He suggests that Americans should be celebrating the fact that a corrupt, thieving politician can no longer steal from hardworking Americans.\n\nHowever, Shaw also touches upon a deeper concern: the impact of such scandals on public trust. When middle-class Americans learn about Jackson Jr.'s extravagant spending, it breeds anger, cynicism, and a diminished faith in government representatives.\n\nIn the words of Alexander Hamilton, \"a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the forbidding appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government.\" Shaw suggests that individuals like Jackson Jr. will always exist in public life, and it is our responsibility to keep a watchful eye and hold them accountable when necessary.\n\nIn essence, Shaw's piece serves as a call to vigilance, reminding readers of the importance of maintaining a critical eye towards those in power, and ensuring that they serve the public interest, not their own.",
    " Title: North Carolina Primary Election Highlights Establishment vs. Tea Party Battle, American Idol Runner-up's Bid, and Controversial Speaker Challenge\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the primary season kicks off, North Carolina, Ohio, and Indiana host primaries today, marking the beginning of a series of elections that will span across 25 states over the next six weeks. Today's key race in North Carolina pits the Republican establishment against the Tea Party, with the Senate primary serving as a potential 2016 proxy fight between Jeb Bush, Rand Paul, and Mike Huckabee.\n\nIn the Republican Senate primary, Thom Tillis, the speaker of the North Carolina House, is the establishment candidate, backed by Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney. Greg Brannon, a physician, is the Tea Party and libertarian favorite, with Rand Paul joining him on the campaign trail Monday. Mark Harris, a preacher, is the Evangelical choice who has galvanized social conservatives, and has been backed by Mike Huckabee. The candidates must receive 40 percent of the vote to avoid a July 15 run-off, with polls showing Tillis leading but just barely clearing that 40 percent mark.\n\nAnother interesting race is the Democratic primary for North Carolina's 2nd Congressional District, where American Idol 2003 runner-up Clay Aiken is facing off against businessman Keith Crisco and Toni Morris, a counselor. With no public polling in this race, it's difficult to predict the outcome.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Rep. Walter Jones is being challenged from the right by GOP consultant and former aide to President George W. Bush, Taylor Griffin. Jones, who is well known for voting for the Iraq war and becoming one of the most vocal members of the GOP against it, has become one of the most vulnerable Republicans this year.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner is facing two challengers, Eric Gurr and J.D. Winteregg, despite being heavily favored to win. Winteregg has gained publicity for releasing an online parody video in the style of the drug Cialis, subtly criticizing Boehner. Winteregg was dismissed from an adjunct teaching position at Cedarville University, a Christian college, after the video aired.\n\nIndiana's primary election, known for its wild primaries, is relatively uneventful this time around, with no open seat battles or high-profile races.\n\nToday's primary election in North Carolina will be the first time voters go to the polls since the state's new voting law was passed in August by the state's GOP governor and legislature. Voting rights advocates will keep an eye on some of the law's provisions, such as a ban on same-day registration and restrictions on early voting.",
    " Title: The Decline of Traditional Media: A New Era of Information Access\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the rapidly evolving digital age, the traditional media landscape is undergoing a significant transformation. The shift is largely due to two primary factors: the growing public disillusionment with the perceived biases of mainstream media and the advent of technology that allows individuals to bypass gatekeepers and access information directly.\n\nOnce upon a time, traditional media outlets held a monopoly on information dissemination, acting as gatekeepers that controlled the narrative. However, as technology advances, this monopoly is crumbling, and the roles of these gatekeepers are becoming increasingly obsolete.\n\nThe media's credibility is being questioned as the public grows tired of what they perceive as biased reporting and distorted news. This disillusionment has been exacerbated by the rise of alternative sources of information, such as social media and independent news outlets, which offer unfiltered news and perspectives.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of this shift can be seen in the political sphere. The 2016 presidential election saw the rise of a candidate, Donald Trump, who openly criticized the media and refused to adhere to the traditional narrative. Despite the media's relentless attacks, Trump's popularity remained strong, highlighting the public's growing disdain for the mainstream media.\n\nThe media's perceived bias has led to a loss of credibility and influence. Many outlets, once revered for their objectivity and public service, are now seen as little more than mouthpieces for political ideologies. This shift has been particularly evident during the 2020 election cycle, with many outlets openly endorsing candidates and openly dispensing with the pretense of objectivity.\n\nThe decline of traditional media is not limited to the news industry. The publishing world is also experiencing a similar shift, with self-publishing and e-books becoming increasingly popular. Independent authors are bypassing traditional publishers and reaching readers directly, challenging the traditional gatekeepers of the literary world.\n\nIn the end, the decline of traditional media is a reflection of the changing times. Technology has empowered individuals, giving them the ability to access information directly and bypass the gatekeepers that once controlled the narrative. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that the role of traditional media will continue to diminish, with individuals taking control of their own information consumption.",
    " Title: The 2016 Election and the Balance of Power: A Look at the Impact of Congressional Majorities on Policy Outcomes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the 2016 election is shaping up to be a significant turning point, with both major parties grappling with internal divisions and external pressures. A closer look at the historical precedent of the 1964 election, as outlined by David Frum in his piece for The Atlantic, offers valuable insights into the potential impact of congressional majorities on policy outcomes in the upcoming election.\n\nThe concern among some progressive groups is that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton may opt for a campaign that focuses primarily on Donald Trump's personality and lack of qualifications, aiming for a landslide victory that would carry no mandate. This strategy, they fear, would result in an anodyne campaign that fails to address pressing policy issues, similar to Lyndon B. Johnson's approach in 1964. Johnson, in an attempt to portray his opponent, Barry Goldwater, as an unacceptable outlier, focused on the idea of a party for all Americans, as evidenced by his 1964 convention speech.\n\nHowever, the 1964 election, as Frum points out, should not be seen as a false choice between a centrist and a leftist approach. Johnson's landslide victory, coupled with historic majorities in the House and Senate, led to a burst of progressive legislation in 1965-'66 that stands alongside 1933-'34 and 1861-'62 as the biggest legislative leaps forward in American history. This demonstrates that the amount of progressive legislation a president can enact is heavily influenced by the shape of Congress rather than the content of their platform.\n\nThe reality is that the 2016 election will likely follow a similar pattern. Clinton does not have a realistic chance of securing large Democratic majorities, but even a small Democratic majority reliant on moderate legislators would pass more progressive legislation than a Republican one. This is due to the fact that House districts are tilted in favor of the Republicans, making it a steep uphill fight for Democrats to secure a narrow majority, let alone a landslide.\n\nThe key to enacting progressive policies, therefore, lies in either swinging Republicans over to the Democratic side or demoralizing Republicans and getting them to stay home altogether. This suggests that the choice between reassuring the center and laying the groundwork for policy on issues is a false one, as the basic LBJ pattern remains valid in 2016 as it was in 1964.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2016 election will be a significant turning point in American politics, with the shape of Congress playing a crucial role in determining the amount of progressive legislation that can be enacted. The choice between a centrist and a leftist approach is a false one, and the focus should be on securing a Democratic majority, no matter how small, to push for progressive policies.",
    " Title: GOP Leaders Divided Over House Republican Proposal for Higher Taxes in Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, leading conservatives have criticized a new House Republican proposal that calls for increased taxes for wealthier Americans as part of a broader deficit reduction package to avoid the fiscal cliff. The proposal, presented by House Speaker John Boehner and other House leaders, has been met with mixed reactions from Senate Republicans, with many of them refraining from harsh criticism while refusing to endorse the plan.\n\nThe $2.2 trillion deficit reduction package, which includes eliminating unspecified deductions and loopholes from the tax code, has drawn fire from conservatives like Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina), who described it as an \"800 billion tax hike that will destroy jobs and allow politicians in Washington to spend even more.\" Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) also voiced his opposition, stating that raising taxes would \"cripple the economy.\"\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, when asked about the plan at a press conference, declined to express support for the proposal, instead commending the House Republican leadership for moving the process forward. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri also expressed cautious optimism, with Thune stating that the plan should be taken seriously by the White House.\n\nDespite the general misgivings about approving tax increases, some Senate GOP leaders, such as Charles Grassley of Iowa, have expressed support for the plan, provided there is a \"willingness on the part of Democrats to accept spending cuts that are three to one or four to one.\"\n\nThe proposal has faced criticism from conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity and Heritage Action for America, with the latter urging its supporters to contact their members of Congress and oppose the compromise.\n\nHouse GOP aides argue that the critical statements from some outside groups and conservative lawmakers demonstrate that the proposal is a serious and credible offer. They also believe that the president is not meeting the same level of criticism because he is proposing a \"Christmas list for the left.\"\n\nThe show of unity from the House GOP leadership, including House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, is intended to stem defections among the rank and file and head off potential questions about differences in strategy among top leaders. Freshman Georgia Republican Rep. Austin Scott has praised House GOP leaders for putting more ideas on the table but has expressed a desire for a deal that reduces the debt more.\n\nAs negotiations continue, House GOP aides recognize that they are likely to lose votes from conservatives if they are able to reach a final deal with the White House. However, they are working closely to keep their message consistent and are pressing the administration to engage and show what kind of cuts to entitlement programs Obama could accept.",
    " Title: Former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee Exits Presidential Race\n\nIn a statement made at the Democratic National Committee Women's Leadership Forum on Friday, former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee announced the end of his long-shot presidential bid. Chafee, a Democrat, had been campaigning on a platform of \"Prosperity Through Peace.\"\n\nChafee, who was a Republican, independent, and then a Democrat, is the second candidate to withdraw from the race this week, following former Virginia Senator Jim Webb's announcement on Tuesday. Webb, unlike Chafee, left open the possibility of running as an independent.\n\nBoth Chafee and Webb had minimal campaign activity, making only a handful of visits to early states. Chafee, in particular, had struggled to make any impact in the race. He raised just $8,300 from 10 major donors during the last quarter. However, his few supporters told NPR this week that they appreciated the positive attitude he brought to the race and hoped he would remain in the mix.\n\nChafee's performance in last week's presidential debate was unremarkable, speaking for just nine minutes during the two-hour faceoff. He emphasized his anti-war stance, a contrast to front-runner Hillary Clinton's controversial 2002 vote. In his withdrawal announcement, Chafee reiterated his anti-war sentiment.\n\nAt the debate, Chafee attempted to engage Clinton on her and her husband's past scandals, but she declined to engage. Chafee's most damaging answer came when he was asked why he voted to repeal banking regulations known as the Glass-Steagall Act. His answer was that he had just joined the Senate after his father's death and was not familiar with the bill, making Chafee come across as unprepared.\n\nEven Chafee's sparsely attended announcement in June that he was running for the White House was widely panned, with much of his time advocating for the U.S. to switch to the metric system.

    " Title: New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte Defends Vote Against Expanded Background Checks, Faces Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of her vote against a bill aimed at expanding background checks on gun purchases, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte has found herself under intense scrutiny and a significant drop in poll numbers. In an attempt to clarify her stance, Ayotte, a Republican, published an op-ed on Monday, aiming to dispel allegations of her opposition to gun control measures.\n\nIn the op-ed, published by Patch news sites in New Hampshire, Ayotte stated, \"Out of state special interests are running false ads attacking me and even lying about my efforts to prevent gun-related violence.\" The senator emphasized her support for effective background checks, claiming she had, in fact, voted to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).\n\nHowever, Ayotte's vote was against a compromise proposed by Senators Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), which would have mandated background checks for sales at gun shows and on the internet. Instead, Ayotte supported an alternative measure, written by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), that focused on encouraging states to submit mental health information to the background check database, without addressing gun shows and internet sales.\n\nAyotte's defense has been under fire since she cast her vote against the Manchin-Toomey proposal last month. Her poll numbers have declined, and two major gun control groups, Michael Bloomberg's Mayors Against Illegal Guns and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' Americans for Responsible Solutions, have run ads in New Hampshire criticizing her. The incident at a town hall, where the daughter of the principal at Sandy Hook Elementary School confronted Ayotte, drew national media attention.\n\nIn response to Ayotte's op-ed, John Feinblatt, Chairman of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, issued a statement, \"In her op-ed, Senator Ayotte says that she voted to improve the existing background check system, but the bill she voted for (Grassley-Cruz) did just the opposite by narrowing the categories of mentally ill people who would be prohibited gun purchasers and potentially calling into question millions of names already in the system.\" Feinblatt further stated, \"Despite the Senator's claim that the current background check system doesn't work, it has blocked over two million dangerous people from buying guns.\"\n\nAs the debate on gun control measures continues, Ayotte's stance and the subsequent criticism she faces serve as a testament to the polarizing nature of the issue and the intensity of feelings on both sides.",
    " Title: Emory University Hospital's Ebola Treatment Unit: A Model for Infectious Disease Care\n\nArticle:\n\nAtlanta's Emory University Hospital has become a global beacon in the fight against Ebola, treating four patients since the end of July, all of whom have survived. The latest patient, Dallas nurse Amber Vinson, was discharged in good health and spirits on Tuesday after more than a week in a special treatment unit at Emory.\n\nDr. Jay Varkey, who heads Emory's Ebola team, told reporters at a news conference Tuesday that the hospital's aggressive treatment approach has proven effective, contradicting the general belief in July that patients requiring dialysis or ventilator support would invariably die.\n\nEmory's plan to treat patients with infectious diseases like Ebola began 12 years ago when the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started working with the hospital to create a special isolation unit. Since then, a core team of health workers has trained yearly and held practice drills every six months to stay prepared for any infectious disease.\n\nIn July, with two Ebola patients on the way, it quickly became clear that Emory's specially trained team was too small. Critical care nurses volunteered to help fill in the gaps but were not part of the core group that had long practiced for this day. The expanded team had to quickly train, and not everyone made the cut.\n\nOnce all team members were in place, they focused on supportive care of these patients, administering IV fluids and preventing infections. \"The true cure for Ebola virus is keeping the patient alive long enough to develop the antibodies that will cause them to get over the infection,\" Varkey says.\n\nEmory learned lessons, big and small, from each case. For example, increasing the amount of working space around patients sick with Ebola helped a lot, as did having a hand sanitizer dispenser available that wouldn't require a gloved hand to operate. Nurses on the Ebola unit, who started out on eight-hour shifts, preferred 12-hour rotations instead. Caring for the emotional health of patients in isolation is as important as promoting physical well-being, the staff learned.\n\nTeam members worked hard to coordinate their efforts, from top administrators to waste management crews, to pharmacists and lab technicians\u2014every department played a role. \"Every morning the team meets to discuss what worked well, what might be refined,\" says Nancye Feistritzer, the hospital's chief of nursing.\n\nEmory's team doesn't claim to have all the right answers, Varkey says. But what they do know, they're sharing. \"Our entire 84-page document, in terms of our protocols,\" he says, \"is now available to any person who wants to access that on the Web.\"\n\nThese protocols went live a week ago. So far, more than 11,300 people have registered to get access to them. This story is part of a reporting partnership between NPR, WABE, and Kaiser Health News.",
    " Title: Houston Struggles with Looting Incidents and Resource Strain as Tropical Storm Harvey Relief Efforts Continue\n\nArticle:\n\nHOUSTON, Texas - Tropical Storm Harvey has left Houston strained under the influx of tens of thousands of evacuees seeking shelter from submerged homes and flooded roads, prompting a midnight curfew due to incidents of looting and armed robberies. The city's resources are being stretched thin, with the fourth-largest U.S. city grappling with the aftermath of the storm that made landfall near Corpus Christi over a week ago.\n\nCity and regional officials have been working tirelessly for over a week on storm preparations and response. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner has urged the U.S. Congress to swiftly approve aid for victims of Tropical Storm Harvey, as the storm is estimated to have caused tens of billions of dollars in damage and claimed at least 25 lives.\n\nIn an effort to address the immediate needs of the city, the Houston City Council has allocated $20 million from a rainy day fund for storm recovery efforts. However, officials have emphasized that this is an initial step and far more will be required. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has estimated that the state could need federal relief totaling over $125 billion, surpassing the aid provided to Hurricane Katrina victims in 2005.\n\nAs rescue operations transition back to law enforcement, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg has vowed to prosecute looters vigorously. At least 40 individuals have been arrested for looting, including one person who allegedly drove a sport utility vehicle into a cash machine.\n\nThe surge in evacuees has put a strain on resources in Houston. As of Wednesday morning, Texas officials reported that close to 49,000 homes had suffered flood damage, with more than 1,000 destroyed. Thousands of other homes are threatened by two reservoirs swollen by as much as 52 inches (132 cm) of rain in some areas.\n\nOfficials have ordered evacuations in several areas around levees or dams, but opted not to call for a mass evacuation, which could have led to chaos during the storm. As Harvey began to cause rain and flooding, the city opened the George R. Brown Convention Center last weekend, initially planning to house 5,000 people. The center's population quickly grew to double that capacity, as people streamed in from areas south and west of Houston.\n\nAt least one man was arrested in the convention center on Thursday after he tried to steal a cot and insulted police officers, according to video posted on social media. Officials opened two more \"mega\" centers late Tuesday at the Toyota Center and NRG Park, which can house a combined total of 20,000 people.\n\nAs police respond to scattered incidents of looting and armed robberies, the mayor has ordered a curfew from midnight to 5 a.m., which residents have respected. There were no arrests for curfew violations on Tuesday night, police said.\n\nThere were at least 17 missing people as of Wednesday afternoon in Harris County, and a family of six, including four children, drowned inside a van in Houston during the storm, law enforcement officials said.\n\nHouston Police Chief Art Acevedo has reported that would-be looters impersonating police officers have knocked on doors in at least two parts of the city, telling residents to evacuate their homes.\n\n\"There's still some significant threats out there,\" Acevedo told a special session of the Houston City Council on Wednesday.\n\nLate Tuesday, Harris County officials opened the shelter at NRG Park, which can house 10,000, and will be staffed in part by members of the National Guard.\n\nWhen a levee broke on Tuesday morning in Brazoria County south of Houston, the county's chief administrator urged residents to \"get out now.\" Mandatory evacuation orders have been issued for Brazoria, Galveston, and Fort Bend counties south and west of Houston, and officials have called for others to leave voluntarily.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, about 8,000 were at the nearly 2-million-square-foot Houston convention center, which had hosted evacuees in at least three prior storms. The population had dipped somewhat as other centers opened and some evacuees moved on. A long-term solution for evacuees has yet to be formulated, officials said.\n\n\"Right now we're just working in 12-hour increments,\" said Tom McCasland, Houston's housing and community development department director and head of the convention center shelter.\n\nSome have criticized the decision not to order a mass evacuation, but officials noted that a 2005 evacuation ahead of Hurricane Rita turned into a nightmare for many in Texas and Louisiana who became trapped in vehicles that ran out of fuel on clogged roadways.\n\nEvacuees have been receiving support from area churches and aid organizations, which have donated clothing, bedding, and food for the displaced. The Red Cross has brought at least 1,000 volunteers to staff the convention center and provided cots, blankets, and food for 34,000 across the region, officials said.\n\nMayor Turner has called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency to send cots, food, and other supplies, as well as to send staff directly into damaged communities, not just into shelters.\n\n\"I can't think of one district where there are not tremendous needs,\" said Turner. \"People are looking for results.\"",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Rubio and Cruz Release Tax Returns, Amplifying Calls for Trump to Follow Suit\n\nIn a move that has intensified the pressure on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have both released their tax returns over the weekend.\n\nMarco Rubio's tax returns, spanning 14 years, reveal that his family's adjusted gross income was $335,561 in 2014, the most recent year made available. The Rubio family paid approximately $65,000 in income taxes, equating to a 19.3% tax rate. This is a decrease from the previous years, with the Rubios reporting nearly $1 million in 2012. The tax returns on the campaign website date back to 2000, when they earned $82,710. According to a statement on the campaign website, the Rubios' only debt today is the mortgage on their house.\n\nTed Cruz, in turn, released 2010-2014 tax returns, having previously disclosed 2006-2010 when he ran for Senate. Cruz reported an adjusted gross income of $1.2 million in 2014, and paid $389,000 in income taxes at a 32.22% rate.\n\nIn a statement, Cruz said, \"It is time to stop the excuses. Donald Trump owes it to the American people to be fully vetted, and that includes releasing his tax returns so the voters can see the full financial picture. His claim that he cannot comply because he is being audited is nonsense. If Donald is embarrassed about his tax returns, it's up to the voters to assess the facts. It's time to stop delaying and come clean with the American people.\"\n\nDuring Thursday night's debate, Trump faced criticism for not releasing his tax returns. Trump responded, \"I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously.\"\n\nAn NPR fact check found that there is no law barring Trump from releasing his returns while being audited, though an accountant or lawyer may have advised him otherwise. The release of Rubio and Cruz's tax returns has added to the calls for Trump to follow suit, as voters and the media continue to scrutinize the financial dealings of the presidential candidates.",
    " Title: The Looming Impact of Automation on American Jobs and Education\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Obama enters his final year in office, Americans are justified in their anger over the slow economic recovery. Good-paying jobs remain scarce, and family incomes have decreased by approximately $1,650 during his tenure. The trend of decreasing job availability, a theme that has persisted since Ronald Reagan's presidency, is often attributed to slow economic growth. However, a closer examination of the data suggests a different narrative.\n\nThe lack of workers adequately trained for a more technologically demanding workforce is slowing growth, not the other way around. Automation, an enduring theme throughout American history, is set to accelerate in the coming years, with robots replacing humans in various sectors, from manufacturing to services.\n\nThe drugstore I visit in Washington no longer employs cashiers; instead, checkout machines and a single clerk assist technologically flummoxed patrons. Over the next two decades, robots will be capable of unloading pallets, stocking shelves, filling prescriptions, and running stores with minimal human intervention. By 2030, it is estimated that 90 percent of jobs as we know them could be replaced by smart machines.\n\nThe challenge lies not in the technology itself, but in training most Americans to engage in intellectually demanding and creative work. The mainstream political class's efforts to make a high school diploma universal have made it a nearly worthless credential. Less than 40 percent of 12th graders are ready to read or learn math at the college level, and many fewer have the skills to enter technically demanding positions without post-secondary training.\n\nA college diploma is not much better. After pushing millions of unqualified students into universities through affirmative action and government loan programs, four in 10 graduates lack the complex reasoning skills needed for white-collar work as it exists today, let alone as it will be after machines equipped with high-level artificial intelligence can replace armies of stockbrokers, insurance adjusters, and restaurant managers over the next several decades.\n\nMeanwhile, the president and his presumptive heir, Hillary Clinton, remain focused on issues like sexism in education and the workplace. The fact that 60 percent of college degrees are now awarded to women and that females often earn more than males in comparable positions are inconvenient facts when there are voters to be misled to extend a political dynasty.\n\nConservatives, including Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, oppose universal standards for more academic rigor like the Common Core. The future lies in educating Americans, not in being angry about false injustice or an omnipresent state, but rather in building and teaching the machines that will do the work that has burdened humanity since the first branch was shaped into a hunting implement.\n\nPeter Morici, an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist, emphasizes the need for young people to be trained and encouraged to do sophisticated work. Without this, the locus of prosperity will permanently shift from America to Asia, where pragmatic leaders urge children to study engineering, not the superstitions peddled by pious academics and deceitful politicians.",
    " Title: Senate Leaders Clash Over Presidential Nominations as Tensions Mount in U.S. Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" program, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) engaged in a contentious debate over the confirmation of President Obama's executive and independent agency nominees, with Reid threatening to rewrite Senate rules to bypass Republican filibusters.\n\nSen. Reid announced his intention to amend the rules to prevent filibusters on non-judicial nominees, while maintaining the filibuster for judicial appointments. He defended the proposed rule change, known as the \"nuclear option,\" as a means to ensure that President Obama's nominees are confirmed to serve in the executive branch and independent agencies.\n\nSen. McConnell countered that the Democrats are seeking a fight where none exists, as Senate Republicans have confirmed a majority of President Obama's nominees at a faster rate than President George W. Bush's nominees at the same point in his term. McConnell questioned the Democrats' motives, asking if they were trying to prevent the Senate from debating these nominations.\n\nThe two leaders did not appear together on the program, speaking sequentially to moderator David Gregory. Sen. Reid has scheduled seven potential filibuster votes for Tuesday morning, including nominations for the Labor Department secretary, Environmental Protection Agency administrator, three members of the National Labor Relations Board, president of the Export-Import Bank, and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe question remains whether Sen. Reid would force a rules change if Republicans filibuster only some of these nominees. He has scheduled the three most controversial votes\u2014for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and two of the NLRB picks\u2014to be first, indicating an attempt to pressure Republicans into conceding.\n\nRepublicans have expressed concern that Sen. Reid's rule change could potentially damage the Senate as an institution. The three main fights over the NLRB and CFPB nominees are particularly contentious, as President Obama used his recess appointment powers to name them to their positions during a time when the Senate did not consider itself in recess. A federal appeals court has ruled that these appointments exceeded Obama's bounds, and the Supreme Court is set to hear the case.\n\nAs the Senate prepares for a showdown, both sides have presented statistics to support their arguments. Republicans claim they have confirmed an exceptional number of President Obama's nominees, while obstructing only a few judges who were outside of mainstream legal thought. Democrats argue that Republicans have obstructed nominees by slow-walking them in committees and demanding extensive information about their histories and policy positions.\n\nSen. Reid stated that Republicans do not object to the nominees' qualifications but rather use them as a means to attack the president's policies or the role of government itself. The filibuster, which is not part of Senate rules, is a tactic used by a single senator or group of senators to indefinitely delay a vote on an issue. Most regular motions require 60 votes to cut off debate, and a failed vote is considered a filibuster.",
    " Title: White House Faces Controversies in Second Term, but Agenda Remains Focus\n\nArticle:\n\nThe White House is currently grappling with a series of controversies that have dominated headlines in recent weeks, inviting comparisons to previous presidents who faced scandals during their second terms. However, a rocky start to a second term does not necessarily mean derailment of a president's goals or agenda.\n\nThe current administration is facing allegations of political targeting by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), secret subpoena of journalists' phone records, and misleading statements about the Benghazi terrorist attack last year. These issues have provided opponents of President Barack Obama with ammunition to try to derail his agenda in the early months of his second term.\n\nDespite the controversies, White House spokesman Jay Carney insisted Tuesday that the issues have little connection to Obama's second-term agenda. The president is focused on economic growth, expanded opportunities for the middle class, and immigration reform, issues that were campaign promises during his re-election last November.\n\nThe full details of the controversies remain unknown, but they are certain to continue to dominate Washington in coming days. Attorney General Eric Holder announced a Justice Department investigation of whether any laws were broken in the IRS political targeting. Congress is also looking into the matter, with a House committee hearing scheduled for Friday.\n\nThe embattled Holder, who was cited for contempt of Congress by House Republicans during Obama's first term over the botched \"Fast and Furious\" gun walking program, also confirmed that he recused himself last year from his department's investigation of classified leaks that led to the recent secret subpoenas of telephone logs of The Associated Press.\n\nRepublicans have called for Obama to demand Holder's resignation over the matter. If not, said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, it will show that \"the president of the United States believes his administration is above the Constitution and does not respect the role of a free press.\"\n\nEven Democrats such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada condemned the secret subpoena of AP phone records. \"I do not know who did it, or why it was done, but it's inexcusable, and there's no way to justify this,\" Reid told reporters.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican senators characterized the IRS political targeting as a broad abuse of power by the administration. \"I have never seen anything quite like this except in the past during the Nixon years,\" veteran Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told reporters in an allusion to the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's impeachment and resignation.\n\nCarney rejected such GOP statements as political hyperbole, but also sought to distance the administration from the roiling issues. \"I understand the natural inclination to try to bunch some of these things together, but there really is a distinction here,\" he said.\n\nCarney refused to discuss specific details of the Justice Department's subpoena of AP telephone records, citing the ongoing criminal investigation of the classified leak. At the same time, he described Obama as desiring a balance between protecting classified information vital to national security and the First Amendment right of a free and unfettered press.\n\nCarney also avoided specific comment on IRS political targeting, saying it would be inappropriate until the upcoming release of an inspector general's report on the matter. He noted Obama's remarks to reporters on Monday that if the reported allegations of political targeting proved true, they would be \"outrageous\" and require immediate action against those responsible.\n\nHowever, Carney criticized the continuing GOP focus on the administration's response in the immediate aftermath of the Benghazi attack last September 11 as a \"sideshow that's driven purely by or largely by political interests.\"\n\nThe Benghazi issue has renewed GOP criticism of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, considered the certain Democratic frontrunner if she decides to run for president in 2016. In particular, Republicans accuse the administration of not bolstering security prior to the attack, of botching the response to it, and of misleading the public in its slow-to-evolve explanation of events less than two months before the November election.\n\nAn independent review of the Benghazi incident, led by Former Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen and former ambassador Thomas Pickering, found no wrongdoing by Clinton. CNN's Chief National Correspondent John King noted that history shows popular politicians can overcome links to scandal. In 1988, Democrats tried to use the Iran-Contra scandal of the Reagan administration against then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, but in the end, Bush won the presidential vote.",
    " Title: House Passes Clean Debt Ceiling Bill, Relying on Democratic Support\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, the House of Representatives has passed a bill to lift the debt ceiling until March 2015, effectively removing the threat of a default until after the November midterm elections. The bill, which was supported by 193 Democrats and 28 Republicans, was passed with a vote of 221-201.\n\nThe bill's passage marks a departure from Speaker John Boehner's (R-Ohio) previous stance in 2011, when he advocated for budget cuts of equal or greater magnitude when the debt limit is raised. The vote also underscores the House Republican Conference's inability to move beyond fiscal fights and highlights the leadership's inability, or unwillingness, to garner votes for their priorities.\n\nAll Republican leadership, including Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), voted for the bill. Other notable Republican figures, such as Reps. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Peter King (R-N.Y.), Buck McKeon (R-Calif.), Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), and Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), also supported the bill.\n\nHowever, not all Republican representatives voted in favor of the bill. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), a potential 2016 presidential candidate, and House Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) were among those who voted against the bill, along with GOP Policy Chairman James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), the chairman of the party's political arm.\n\nThe Senate could vote on the debt limit bill as early as Wednesday, depending on whether Republicans agree to allow fast consideration of the legislation. Once the Senate clears the bill, Congress will not face a major fiscal decision until government funding runs dry on September 30.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney described the House vote as a \"positive step in moving away from political brinkmanship.\" The vote represents the latest instance of Speaker Boehner relying on Democratic support to pass legislation that wide swaths of his party do not support. Boehner has also relied on Democratic support to reopen the federal government, approve Hurricane Sandy relief funds, and avert the fiscal cliff.\n\nTuesday's vote was the culmination of a series of fits and starts over the last few weeks. Republicans, cognizant of the rank and file's reluctance to vote for a debt ceiling increase, floated a number of sweeteners to accompany the increase. However, each time leadership proposed something new, the rank and file rejected it. On Monday, in a meeting at the Capitol, they settled on a 13-month debt limit increase alongside language to reverse retirement benefits for the military and create a fund to facilitate the long-term reform of the Medicare reimbursement rate for physicians.\n\nHowever, GOP leadership realized they would not have enough support, and on Tuesday morning, Boehner announced during a meeting at the Capitol Hill Club that he would seek to pass a clean debt limit increase. Boehner denied that it was a result of having less leverage after the October 2013 government shutdown.\n\n\"No, it's the fact that we don't have 218 votes,\" Boehner said. \"And when you don't have 218 votes, you have nothing. We've seen that before, we see it again.\"\n\nThere was rancor within the rank and file and in leadership, where many wanted to set aside the issue, especially since the GOP is gaining political momentum due to troubles with Obamacare. However, outside conservative groups, including the Club for Growth, called on Republicans to oppose the bill. Boehner blamed President Barack Obama for the divisions within the House Republican Conference.\n\n\"You've all known that our members are not crazy about voting to increase the debt ceiling,\" Boehner said Tuesday morning. \"Our members are also very upset with the president. He won't negotiate. He won't deal with our long-term spending problems without us raising taxes. He won't even sit down and discuss these issues. He's the one driving up the debt, and the question they're asking is, why should I deal with his debt limit?\"",
    " Title: U.S.-Germany Tensions Escalate over Alleged Surveillance of Chancellor Merkel's Phone\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions between the United States and its European ally, Germany, have escalated following reports that the National Security Agency (NSA) may have monitored the phone calls of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The latest report in The Guardian suggests that a secret memo reveals the NSA encouraged top departments to share their contact lists to keep numbers for top foreign leaders in their surveillance systems.\n\nThe document reportedly states that an official handed over 200 numbers, some of which covered 35 world leaders, although their identities were not disclosed. The German government has already expressed outrage over the allegations, with Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle summoning U.S. Ambassador John B. Emerson for a meeting.\n\nIn a written statement, Westerwelle stated, \"It is unacceptable that the mobile phone of our Federal Chancellor may have been subject to surveillance activities by our American partners.\" He further added, \"For us, spying on close friends and partners is totally unacceptable. This undermines trust, and this can harm our friendship.\"\n\nThe White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, while stating that the U.S. \"is not monitoring and will not monitor\" Merkel's communications, did not deny that such surveillance may have occurred in the past. This is the latest in a series of flare-ups over reported surveillance that has involved France, Mexico, and Brazil.\n\nFrance also demanded explanations over a report that the U.S. swept up millions of French phone records. Germany, which has Europe's biggest economy, has been one of Washington's closest allies in Europe. The United States was West Germany's protector during the Cold War, and the country is still home to thousands of U.S. troops.\n\nGermany's sharp tone and frustration over the answers provided so far by the U.S. government are evident, with prominent lawmaker Wolfgang Bosbach, who heads Parliament's domestic affairs committee, stating, \"I think we are all outraged, across party lines.\" Bosbach further criticized Carney's statement, saying it does not address the possibility of past surveillance.\n\nMerkel had previously raised concerns over allegations of mass electronic eavesdropping when Obama visited Germany in June, demanding answers from the U.S. government and backing calls for greater European data protection. This week, her government is striking a markedly sharper tone, signaling frustration over the answers provided so far by the U.S. government. More damaging information could be on the horizon, with The Washington Post reporting that U.S. officials are telling some foreign intelligence agencies that NSA leaker Edward Snowden has documents detailing their cooperation with the United States.",
    " Title: Supreme Court to Consider Same-sex Marriage Cases from Five States in Upcoming Term\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court has announced that it will consider same-sex marriage cases from five states during its private conference on Monday, signaling its readiness to engage in the ongoing national debate. The justices have listed cases from Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana, and Wisconsin for their first conference of the 2014 term.\n\nThe court's decision to consider all five cases simultaneously grants equal treatment to the Indiana and Wisconsin cases, which were decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit just last month. The 10th and 4th Circuits have previously ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in the other cases.\n\nThe court has the option to hear one or more of these cases this winter, deny them all, or delay its decision until a later date. In all five states, federal district and appellate courts have ruled that state bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional. However, these decisions are currently on hold pending the Supreme Court's review.\n\nAdditional same-sex marriage cases could soon be added to the justices' list. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit is expected to rule on cases from Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Oral arguments were also heard earlier this month in cases stemming from Idaho and Nevada by the 9th Circuit. Cases from Texas and Florida remain at the appellate court level.\n\nIn June 2013, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages legally performed in states that allow them. Since then, the number of states recognizing same-sex marriages has grown to 19, along with the District of Columbia. The court also declined to overrule a California court's decision that struck down that state's ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nThirty-one states still prohibit gays and lesbians from marrying, including all the states with cases pending before the Supreme Court. The justices are widely anticipated to rule on the constitutionality of these bans during this term.",
    " Title: Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis Skips Women for Trump Event Due to Scheduled Execution\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis will not be attending the Women for Trump event in Tampa this Thursday, as previously announced. The reason for her absence is a scheduling conflict due to a planned execution, according to the governor's office.\n\nThe event, titled \"An Evening to Empower,\" is scheduled to coincide with the 99th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. The event at the Tampa Convention Center is set to feature notable Republican women, including Kellyanne Conway, former Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Casey DeSantis.\n\nHowever, the execution of Gary Ray Bowles, a serial killer who targeted gay men, is scheduled for the same time. Governor Ron DeSantis signed a death warrant for Bowles earlier this summer.\n\nAlex Garcia, who is overseeing Trump re-election campaign efforts in Florida, confirmed that Casey DeSantis had a \"scheduling conflict\" and that the announcement advertising the event was \"a tad premature.\" Garcia acknowledged the execution as the main reason for the first lady's absence and stated that \"everyone is locked down\" during executions.\n\nHelen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, a spokesperson for the governor, noted that, although the first lady is not an elected official, \"out of protocol, the executive office of the governor does not participate in any public event\" while an execution is carried out.\n\nIn 2013, Bondi came under heavy criticism after she asked then-Governor Rick Scott to move the date of an execution because it conflicted with a kickoff fundraiser for her re-election. She later admitted that she should not have requested the date change.",
    " Title: Republican Presidential Race in 2015: A Volatile and Odd Journey Concludes with a Smaller, Less Eventful Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican presidential race of 2015 has been marked by volatility and unpredictability, as evidenced by a Fox News Poll released on Dec. 16, 2014. The current field of candidates is five times larger than it was a year ago, with 9 candidates participating in the final Republican debate of 2015, held at The Venetian Las Vegas on Tuesday, December 15.\n\nThe debate, which was smaller in both candidate count and duration compared to the last time CNN/Salem Radio hosted the event, was still marred by the same problems as before: a lengthy, lumbering, and laxly moderated candidates' forum. Here are seven observations from this final Republican debate of 2015:\n\n1. No One Trumped Trump: Despite numerous attempts, no candidate was able to challenge Donald Trump's frontrunner status. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul criticized Trump on Internet policy at the debate's start, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush expressed disapproval of Trump's approach. However, Trump's position on the stage was not earned through deep thinking or refined elegance, but rather through his popularity. Attempts to deconstruct The Donald were largely ineffective, as many of Trump's rivals failed to make a lasting impression on how they would defeat ISIS and protect the homeland.\n\n2. The Cage Match: The much-anticipated dust-up between Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump did not materialize, as both candidates were too smart to take the bait. Sen. Cruz did engage in some momentary tussles with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio over Senate votes and with Trump over personal matters, while Trump's testiest moments came in a back-and-forth with Bush over demeanor and poll numbers.\n\n3. Executive Order: The debate was long on tough talk about leadership skills, providing an opportunity for the two sitting governors, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, to showcase their experience. However, both candidates faced challenges. Christie's numbers were low, and the round-robin style of questioning often reduced him to reminding viewers of the senators' perceived inadequacies. Kasich, on the other hand, continued to recite his lengthy Washington biography, a strategy that may not resonate with the Republican base.\n\n4. Auld Lang Syne: The GOP's debate circuit for 2015 has now come to an end. The next debate will take place on January 14, 2016, in North Charleston, S.C., and will be hosted by the Fox Business Network.\n\n5. A Time for Reflection: With the debate's conclusion, the campaign season enters a period of reflection and strategizing, as candidates prepare for the primary elections. Tempers were short, and the candidates seemed tired of sharing the same oxygen, giving the debate a sense of urgency and exhaustion.\n\n6. Debate Winners: Trump and Cruz were the standout performers of the debate, playing mostly error-free ball.\n\n7. Debate Losers: Anyone who missed the \"Star Wars\" premiere by staying home to watch the debate, as it was largely uneventful.",

    " Title: Pope Francis' Remarks on Religious Insults Spark Controversy Among Catholics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, Pope Francis has faced criticism for his comments regarding the limits of free speech, particularly when it comes to insulting another's faith. The Pope made these remarks during a flight to the Philippines, where he gestured as if to punch a colleague to illustrate his point that there should be limits on the right to insult another's faith.\n\nThe Vatican later clarified that the Pope's words were spoken colloquially and consistent with his free-flowing speech style. However, the Pope's comments have raised concerns about his apparent belief that religion should have special protection when it comes to free speech.\n\n\"One cannot provoke, one cannot insult other people's faith, one cannot make fun of faith,\" the Pope said. \"There is a limit. Every religion has its dignity.\"\n\nThe Pope's comments come in response to the massacre of journalists at Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris last week, although he did not explicitly blame the slain cartoonists for the attack. However, his comments have been interpreted as implying that criticism of religion is problematic.\n\nWhile the Pope's informal style of speaking with reporters on the papal plane is well-known, his words are still reported and analyzed. The Pope is not the only prominent Catholic raising the issue. Bill Donahue, the president of the New York-based Catholic League, released a statement on the day of the killings, saying, \"Muslims have a right to be angry.\"\n\nWhile Donahue's tone was offensive, the gist of the Pope's message was the same: criticism of religion is problematic. However, some Christian leaders, such as Jim Wallis, president of Sojourners, a progressive, evangelical community and publication, have offered a different response to the Paris attacks. Wallis suggested that people of faith should respond to the attacks by \"blessing those who persecute us, returning love for hate and good for evil, and even loving our enemies.\"\n\nIn the United States, the Supreme Court outlawed blasphemy laws in 1952. It is hoped that the Pope was only offering counsel to his followers, rather than advocating for any sort of legal position. No one has the right not to be offended, even the Pope.",
    " Title: CNN and MSNBC's Controversial Use of Chyrons in Political Reporting\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of political journalism, the use of graphics at the bottom of the screen, known as chyrons, has long been a staple for identifying people and places in news stories. However, two major television networks, CNN and MSNBC, have recently been incorporating analysis into these chyrons during their news reporting, a practice that has sparked controversy and accusations of a double-standard.\n\nThe trend began in June when Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, denied having said that Japan should possess nuclear weapons. CNN responded with a chyron that read: \"TRUMP: I NEVER SAID JAPAN SHOULD HAVE NUKES (HE DID)\". Last week, when Eric Trump claimed his father had apologized to the Khan family after their speech at the Democratic National Convention, CNN used a similar approach with: \"Last week, Trump claimed his father had apologized to the Khan family... (HE DIDN'T)\".\n\nMSNBC followed suit, using parentheses to fact-check Trump's claims. When Trump asserted that he had seen a video of $400 million being sent to Iran by the Obama administration around the time they were releasing American hostages, MSNBC's chyron read: \"TRUMP SAYS HE WATCHED (NONEXISTENT) VIDEO OF IRAN RECEIVING CASH\".\n\nHowever, the use of these chyrons has not been applied equally to all candidates. After Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, stated that FBI Director James Comey had called her answers about her private email use as secretary of state \u201ctruthful\u201d, a claim Comey did not make, CNN and MSNBC did not fact-check this statement with their parentheses.\n\nSimilarly, Clinton's claim that GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence had \"slashed\" education spending as governor of Indiana, a claim that was rated \"false\" by Politifact, did not prompt a fact-check from the networks' chyrons.\n\nOutlets like Mediaite and The Daily Caller have raised questions about this perceived double-standard in the use of chyrons. The practice of fact-checking through chyrons may or may not be a legitimate new use of the tool, but its application seems to be selective, leading to accusations of bias.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Secure Necessary Votes to Maintain Iran Nuclear Deal, Obama Veto Threatened\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democrats have secured the 34 votes needed to maintain the Iran nuclear deal, handing President Barack Obama a significant foreign policy victory. Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland became the crucial 34th vote Wednesday morning, declaring the agreement as the best way to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nThe Senate is set to vote later this month on a resolution disapproving the deal, which is unanimously opposed by Republicans, who label it a dangerous giveaway to Iran. Obama has vowed to veto the resolution if it passes, and with 34 votes, Democrats now have the necessary support to uphold his veto.\n\nThe agreement, signed by Iran, the U.S., and five other world powers, aims to dismantle Iran's nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in relief from sanctions. The deal seeks to ensure that Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful, and it is set to last for 15 years.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry is sending a letter to all members of Congress outlining U.S. security commitments to Israel and the Gulf Arab states in light of the nuclear deal. The letter comes as Kerry prepares to deliver a major policy speech Wednesday in Philadelphia that focuses on how the international agreement makes the U.S. and its allies safer and how the deal is being mischaracterized by some opponents.\n\n\"I really believe the fastest way to a genuine arms race in the Middle East is to not have this agreement,\" Kerry said in a nationally broadcast interview Wednesday. \"Because if you don't have this agreement, Iran has already made clear what its direction is.\"\n\nWith opposition to the agreement failing to gain traction on the Democratic side, supporters may even be able to muster the 41 votes needed to block the resolution from passing in the first place, sparing Obama from having to use his veto pen. That would require eight of the 11 remaining undeclared senators to decide in favor of the deal.\n\n\"This agreement will substantially constrain the Iranian nuclear program for its duration, and compared with all realistic alternatives, it is the best option available to us at this time,\" said Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. In remarks at the University of Delaware, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware said, \"I will support this agreement despite its flaws because it is the better strategy for the United States to lead a coalesced global community in containing the spread of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nRepublicans in Congress and those running for president unanimously oppose the deal, which aims to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. The Israeli government is vehemently against it, contending that concessions made to Iran could empower that country, which has sworn to destroy Israel. However, critics have failed to use Congress' summer recess to turn the tide against the agreement, despite a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign funded by the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC.\n\nOnly two Democratic senators have come out against the deal \u2014 Chuck Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey \u2014 while in recent weeks undeclared Democratic senators, even from red states, have broken in favor one after another.\n\nEven if Congress were able to pass the disapproval resolution, it can't stop the deal, which was agreed to among Iran, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China. In July, the U.N. Security Council unanimously endorsed the nuclear deal, approving a resolution that would lift the international sanctions on Iran in 90 days.",
    " Title: House Homeland Security Committee Seeks Information on Extremist Involvement in George Floyd Protests\n\nThe House Homeland Security Committee has requested more information from administration officials about alleged extremist involvement in protests over the death of George Floyd. In a letter dated Tuesday and addressed to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, the committee, led by Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), expressed \"serious concerns\" about the \"Constitutional implications\" of officials' statements that left-wing and right-wing extremists are instigating violence at Floyd protests.\n\nThe committee is seeking documents from January 1 to the present related to intelligence on ongoing protests, including information given to law enforcement partners, designation of groups as domestic terrorist organizations, deployment of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees at demonstrations, and surveillance of protesters. The deadline to deliver the documents is June 19, and the committee will be briefed by the DHS and the FBI by June 12.\n\nThe request comes amid reports that right-wing and left-wing anti-government groups have been involved in the Floyd protests within Minnesota and across the country. President Donald Trump announced on Monday that the U.S. plans to designate anti-fascist activists, known as antifa, as a terrorist organization, although federal authorities are unable to label domestic groups as terrorist organizations. Attorney General William Barr also called out the decentralized group on Sunday, stating that the violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.",
    " Title: Hope Hicks Returns to White House After Two-Year Absence\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington \u2014 Hope Hicks, the former top White House aide and longtime confidante to President Donald Trump, is returning to the White House roughly two years after she left. A White House official confirmed that Hicks will be working closely with Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner and political director Brian Jack, and will not be a part of the communications department.\n\nAt 31, Hicks served as a top communications aide before leaving the White House in 2018 to take a position at the Fox Corporation in California. The announcement of Hick's departure came a day after she testified before the House Judiciary Committee during the Mueller investigation. Hicks is expected to begin in early March, although the timeline is not set in stone.\n\n\"There is no one more devoted to implementing President Trump's agenda than Hope Hicks. We are excited to have her back on the team,\" Kushner said in a statement.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham added that Hicks \"is one of the most talented and savvy individuals I have come across. She has always impressed me with her quiet confidence, loyalty, and expertise, and I am beyond thrilled to welcome Hope back to the White House.\"\n\nHicks, who had virtually no experience in politics before she joined the Trump campaign in its earliest days, became one of the president's closest advisers, leaving a noticeable gap when she left. The end of Hicks' tenure at the White House was muddled with controversy, as then-White House staff secretary Rob Porter was accused of abuse by his two ex-wives. Porter eventually resigned.\n\nHicks admitted during congressional testimony that she told some \"white lies\" to defend the president.\n\nHicks' return comes after the formal conclusion of two monumental investigations into the president \u2014 the Russia investigation and the impeachment saga.\n\nA source close to Hicks said that she is returning to the White House out of a sense of duty and purpose. While she was enjoying her life in the corporate world, outside the White House, she's returning partly due to a sense of duty to this president and this administration. The former model had been considering a return over the past few months.",
    " Title: PG&E to Plead Guilty to 84 Counts of Involuntary Manslaughter in Deadly 2018 California Wildfire\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) has announced it will plead guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in connection with the 2018 Camp Fire that destroyed three Northern California towns and resulted in the deaths of 84 people. The plea agreement, announced Monday, resolves the charges facing PG&E as part of a previously sealed indictment in Butte County.\n\nThe plea agreement comes as the company is already serving a five-year criminal probation for six felony counts for falsifying records and other safety violations underlying a natural gas explosion that killed eight people in San Bruno, California in 2010. As with its prior criminal conviction, no one from PG&E will go to prison for the company's felony crimes. Instead, its plea agreement with the Butte County District Attorney's office calls for PG&E to pay a $4 million fine, the maximum allowed.\n\nPG&E will also help pay for efforts to restore access to water for residents affected by the loss of a canal destroyed by what became known as the Camp Fire. \"We can not replace all that the fire destroyed, but our hope is that this plea agreement, along with our rebuilding efforts, will help the community move forward from this tragic incident,\" PG&E Corp. CEO Bill Johnson said.\n\nButte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said he hopes the plea agreement will bring \"a bit of a sense of justice done\" for the fire. However, Camp Fire survivor Lisa Williams was outraged with the outcome. \"It's a crime against society,\" she said. \"A fine doesn't change their behavior. They pay it and repeat bad behavior.\"\n\nOne of those who died was Jay Downer's wheelchair-using brother, with his dog by his side. Jay Downer also expressed his dismay at the price PG&E will pay for its lethal negligence. \"If I fell asleep at the wheel of a car and killed one person, I would be charged with manslaughter and I would be spending time in jail,\" Downer said.\n\nPG&E is scheduled to enter its plea and face sentencing at a court hearing scheduled for April 24. The Nov. 8, 2018, Camp Fire was fanned by strong winds, forcing thousands of people to quickly flee in their cars as flames ripped through the narrow canyon communities. Survivors described caravans of vehicles engulfed by the fire.\n\nButte County officials have pegged the 2018 wildfire's death toll at 85, but Ramsey disclosed Monday that further evidence cast doubt about whether one of the deaths was directly caused by the blaze. The Camp Fire followed a series of 2017 blazes that tore through Northern California and killed 44 people. Although state investigators didn't find PG&E culpable for those fires, the company is accepting responsibility for them in its bankruptcy case as part of a $13.5 billion settlement that will pay the victims of the 2017 and 2018 fires.\n\nLess than three months after the Butte County fires, PG&E filed for bankruptcy in early 2019 to help shield the utility from more than $50 billion in claimed losses stemming from a badly outdated electrical grid. PG&E has settled those claims for $25.5 billion, including the fund set up for the wildfire victims. Since the bankruptcy filing, PG&E hired Johnson as its new leader to shape up its culture as the company steps up its efforts to improve the safety and reliability of its power lines.\n\nJohnson hailed the plea agreement as a sign that PG&E is \"working to create a better future for all concerned. We want wildfire victims, our customers, our regulators, and leaders to know that the lessons we learned from the Camp Fire remain a driving force for us to transform this company.\" Johnson has previously acknowledged that it will take many years to pull that off while PG&E pours an estimated $40 billion into badly needed upgrades.\n\nIn the meantime, PG&E plans to periodically turn off the power during extremely windy and dry conditions to minimize fire risks in parts of a sprawling service territory that provides electricity to 16 million people. By its own admission, PG&E bungled the deliberate blackouts it imposed last autumn to the exasperation of customers and community leaders who complained about not being told about the outages.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom had previously expressed doubts about whether the company has made enough changes to reform its ways, and he had been threatening to block PG&E's plan to get out of bankruptcy this summer. PG&E's chief regulator, the California Public Utilities Commission, still must approve the company's bankruptcy plan, a decision that's expected within the next few weeks. Last week Newsom dropped his objections amid the coronavirus outbreak that prompted him to order everyone in the state to remain in their homes as much as possible to reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\nCalifornia holds unusual leverage over PG&E's fate in bankruptcy because the company needs state approval of its plan to qualify for coverage from a wildfire insurance fund that the state created last summer. Newsom backpedaled in a Friday bankruptcy court filing, saying he now believes PG&E's plan qualifies it for the coverage. As part of his deal with PG&E, the Democratic governor is still reserving the right to pursue a government-financed takeover of the company if it doesn't emerge from bankruptcy by a June 30 deadline.",
    " Title: All Members of President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities Resign in Protest of Trump's Charlottesville Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a unified response to President Donald Trump's controversial remarks regarding the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, all 17 members of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities (PCAH) have resigned. The move follows Trump's disbanding of the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategy and Policy Forum after several business leaders resigned from these groups in protest over his remarks.\n\nIn a letter of resignation tweeted by PCAH committee member Kal Penn on Friday morning, the committee expressed their disapproval of Trump's support for the hate groups and terrorists who caused harm in Charlottesville. The letter, which spells out the word \"RESIST\" when the first letters of each paragraph are combined, is a clear statement of opposition to the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House issued a statement on Friday afternoon claiming that the president had intended to disband the council anyway. This mirrors Trump's previous claim that he was disbanding the Strategy and Policy Forum after all its members had made the decision to disband it on their own. In response, Penn tweeted, \"Lol @realDonaldTrump you can't break up with us after we broke up with you LMFAO.\"\n\nThe PCAH is a federal agency headed by Melania Trump as honorary chair and is responsible for education and cultural ambassadorship for the arts. Unlike the other advisory councils Trump has recently disbanded, the PCAH is a federal agency, and its members were appointed by President Obama. The committee includes cultural figureheads such as author Jhumpa Lahiri and writer-director George C. Wolfe.\n\nIn their resignation letter, the committee condemned the administration's refusal to quickly and unequivocally condemn hatred and expressed concern over the president's actions that they believe undermine civil liberties, arts and culture agencies, diplomacy funding, and the free press. The letter also highlighted the importance of the arts in creating empathy and love, and the role of the humanities in supporting a vibrant free press.\n\nAll 17 members of the committee signed the letter, including Wolfe, who added his signature after Penn's tweet featuring the initial 16 signatories. Though the committee had not met under Trump's administration, Politico reports that it had continued to do some of its basic work, which includes overseeing educational programs and diplomatic functions. The resignation of the full committee makes the PCAH the first White House agency to officially dissolve under President Trump.\n\n\"Supremacy, discrimination, and vitriol are not American values,\" the letter concluded. \"We must be better than this.\"",
    " Title: Trump Administration Prepares to Expand Travel Ban, Focuses on Information Sharing and Enhanced Screening\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is preparing to expand its travel ban executive order, with a focus on additional traveler screening and information sharing with countries that have been deemed less cooperative, administration officials announced on Friday. The current travel ban, which includes a 90-day pause on some admissions from six terrorist-connected countries, is set to expire on Sunday.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke has submitted a set of recommendations to President Trump for countries that should still face travel restrictions or enhanced screening. The White House, Homeland Security, and State Department officials declined to discuss which countries are under consideration, but noted that some countries have been added to the list due to their lack of cooperation.\n\nThe government underwent a months-long, two-tier review of other countries' information-sharing with the U.S. After an initial assessment, countries that were deemed \"inadequate\" were put on 50-day notice that if they didn't promise to comply, they could face restrictions.\n\n\"We managed to get countries who had not previously been sharing things like terrorist information to start doing just that,\" said Miles Taylor, counselor to Ms. Duke. However, he added that some countries were \"still unable or worse yet, deliberately unwilling to comply.\"\n\nThe new standards proposed by Ms. Duke are conditions-based, rather than the time-based 90-day approach Mr. Trump took in his initial executive order. The administration's political opponents have criticized the process, with Johnathan Smith, legal director of Muslim Advocates, stating, \"Any nominal changes in countries or security rationalizations will not change that: This order has been and will continue to be the president's way of making good on his campaign promise to institute a Muslim ban.\"\n\nThe original travel ban, which grew out of then-candidate Trump's demand for \"extreme vetting\" of travelers, particularly those from Muslim countries, faced resistance in the courts and was met with controversy. The new order, which cut Iraq from the list of targeted countries and curtailed the ban so it didn't apply to legal immigrants and some others with deep ties to the U.S., is currently under review by the Supreme Court.\n\nOfficials briefing reporters on Friday said they can't predict how the updates will affect the court case since Mr. Trump hasn't announced a final decision yet. However, they noted that the Justice Department has been consulted throughout the process. The Supreme Court justices have delivered a mixed verdict on the current ban, ruling that Mr. Trump does have important national security powers that must be respected, but finding that in cases where the would-be visitor has \"bona fide\" ties to a person or institution in the U.S., they have rights that must also be respected.",
    " Title: Colorado Baker Files Lawsuit Against State Over Refusal to Make Cake for Transgender Woman\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that mirrors a previous Supreme Court case, a Colorado baker is suing the state after it launched a new case against him for declining to create a cake for a transgender woman. Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado, alleges that the state's Civil Rights Commission has violated his constitutional rights to free speech, freedom of religion, equal protection, and due process, according to a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Denver on Tuesday.\n\nThe lawsuit, which also names Governor John Hickenlooper and Cynthia Coffman, the state attorney general, seeks permanent injunctions against the state from taking any enforcement action against Phillips, who the lawsuit claims was \"vindicated\" by the Supreme Court ruling. In June, the Supreme Court ruled that the Colorado's civil rights commission was hostile toward Phillips' Christian beliefs when it cited him for refusing to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple in 2012, but did not rule on whether he violated Colorado's public accommodation statute.\n\nThe lawsuit stems from a complaint filed by Denver attorney Autumn Scardina with the civil rights commission in 2017, in which she claims that Phillips refused to bake a cake that \"celebrates my transition from male to female.\" Scardina did not immediately return a phone message left at her law office.\n\nThe director of the state's Civil Rights Division, Aubrey Elenis, ruled in June that Phillips discriminated against Scardina. \"The evidence thus demonstrates that the refusal to provide service to (Scardina) was based on (her) transgender status,\" Elenis wrote in a probable cause determination. The finding by Elenis requires both sides to resolve the issue through \"compulsory mediation,\" the document said.\n\nPhillips is also seeking $100,000 in punitive damages against Elenis \"for her unconstitutional actions,\" according to the lawsuit. Daniel Ramos, executive director of One Colorado, a group that advocates for the LGBTQ community, criticized the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the conservative Christian group whose lawyers represent Phillips.\n\n\"We have seen the ADF launch similar lawsuits across the country that target nondiscrimination laws and civil rights agencies, and this broad lawsuit they filed on behalf of Jack Phillips reads as more of the same,\" Ramos said. The civil rights commission declined to comment on Phillips' lawsuit.",
    " Title: Study Suggests Bias in Mainstream Economic News Coverage Favoring Democratic Presidents\n\nA new study published in the journal American Politics Research indicates that mainstream economic news coverage tends to be biased in favor of Democratic presidents. The research, conducted by Eric Merkley, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of British Columbia, provides evidence that the media is more charitable to Democratic administrations than Republican ones.\n\nMerkley used automated content analysis software to evaluate the tone of 400,000 news articles related to unemployment and inflation, published between 1985 and 2013 by 23 high-circulating American newspapers and the Associated Press. The study excluded editorials and opinion pieces.\n\nThe study found that the tone of economic news coverage was more positive during Democratic presidencies, even after controlling for the economic performance. Merkley explained that journalists appropriately reduce tone in economic news in response to worsening economic conditions under Republican presidents, but are problematically more charitable during Democratic administrations.\n\n\"Journalists broadly lean to the political left and this has become increasingly true over time. These findings suggest there is a real possibility that journalists subtly frame news content in ways that serve their partisan interests,\" Merkley told \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nMerkley emphasized that the study's findings are consistent with confirmation bias, rather than deliberate manipulation of content to harm Republican presidents. He also acknowledged that the findings are not the only word or the last word on this question, as there has been a large amount of work published on this topic and the findings have been very mixed.\n\nThe study's limitations include the fact that the findings only apply to economic news content, and patterns of bias may vary across broader issue types. Merkley suggested that the news media may be biased against Republicans on economic issues because journalists expect performance to be poor compared to Democratic administrations. However, the pattern of bias may go against Democrats on different issues, such as crime reporting.\n\nMerkley also noted that the methodology cannot address the growing conservative echo chamber, such as Fox News, Breitbart News, and Town Hall, and that the focus of the research is in mainstream news outlets.\n\n\"Trust in the mainstream media has been on the decline for decades. It has fallen most among supporters of the Republican Party, partially in response to a constant drumbeat of complaints about a biased press from conservative elites. This is a serious problem. Trust in the mainstream news is essential for the health of a democracy, now more than ever,\" Merkley said.",
    " Title: Georgia Grand Jury to Decide Fate of Ahmaud Arbery, 25-Year-Old Black Man Shot by Armed White Men\n\nA grand jury will decide whether criminal charges are warranted in the death of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was shot after he was chased by two armed white men who believed he was a burglary suspect. Ahmaud Arbery was killed in February in a neighborhood outside Brunswick, Georgia.\n\nAccording to reports, Arbery was jogging when he was killed. His family and their attorneys said he was a frequent runner. Akeem Baker, a friend of Arbery, started a Facebook page and GoFundMe called \"I Run With Maud\" to raise awareness about Arbery's killing. As of Wednesday, the GoFundMe had raised more than $14,000, and the page had more than 21,000 followers. A dedication run is planned for Friday.\n\nThere have been no arrests or charges in the case, prosecutor Tom Durden said in a statement Tuesday. He plans to have a grand jury hear the evidence in the shooting, but a hearing won't happen until mid-June at the earliest when Georgia courts reopen from coronavirus restrictions.\n\n\"I am of the opinion that the case should be presented to the grand jury of Glynn County for consideration of criminal charges against those involved in the death of Mr. Arbery,\" Durden said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nTuesday evening, Durden asked the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to look into the case, according to the agency. Director Vic Reynolds issued a video statement on the case Wednesday, saying his team would operate the investigation out of its headquarters and \"bring to bear every resource and experience this agency has in resolving this matter.\"\n\nArbery was shot after two men saw him running in their neighborhood and armed themselves with guns before getting in a truck to pursue him, according to an incident report filed by Glynn County police. Gregory McMichael, one of the men, told police he was in his front yard when he saw \"the suspect from the break-ins\" running down the street. McMichael and his adult son, Travis, grabbed guns because they \"didn't know if the male was armed or not,\" according to the police report.\n\nMcMichael and his son chased Arbery, and a struggle ensued, resulting in Arbery's death. Video footage of the event has been posted online, showing a black man jogging on a two-lane road in daylight. A white truck is parked in the road ahead of him; a man stands in the pickup bed, and another is beside the open driver's-side door. The runner passes the pickup on the passenger side. There is shouting, then a gunshot, and the video shows the runner grappling with a man in the street over what appears to be a shotgun or rifle. A second shot goes off, and the runner punches the man. A third shot is fired at point-blank range. The runner staggers a few feet and falls face down.\n\nThe video, which appears to be shot from a moving vehicle behind the runner, has been widely circulated online, but its authenticity has not been independently verified.\n\nAttorney S. Lee Merritt, who is representing Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper, said a \"false narrative\" had been created that the video disproved. \"Mr. Arbery had not committed any crime, and there was no reason for these men to believe they had the right to stop him with weapons or to use deadly force in furtherance of their unlawful attempted stop. This is murder,\" Merritt said.\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp, who had not addressed the shooting until this week, tweeted Tuesday that \"Georgians deserve answers\" and that the state Bureau of Investigation supports Durden \"to ensure a thorough, independent investigation\" into Arbery's death.\n\nDozens of demonstrators walked through Brunswick Tuesday, holding signs that said, \"Justice for Ahmaud Arbery\" and \"I run with Maud.\" More demonstrators walked around the state Capitol in Atlanta on Wednesday, demanding justice. The Georgia NAACP was to hold a protest with Arbery's family at the Glynn County Courthouse on Friday.\n\nSeveral lawmakers have spoken out, including Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who tweeted late Tuesday that Arbery was \"killed in cold blood.\" Former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said, \"Our systems of law enforcement and justice must be held to the highest standards.\" She called for a \"full investigation, appropriate charges, and an unbiased prosecution.\" Senator Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a former Democratic presidential candidate, said on Twitter the video \"sickens me to my core.\" \"Exercising while Black should not be a death sentence,\" she said.",
    " Title: Former Senator Jeff Flake Predicts Intra-Party Challenge to President Trump in 2020 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, former Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) has predicted that the 2020 presidential race will see a challenge from within the Republican Party against President Donald Trump. Flake, who has been vocal about his disagreements with the President, expressed his belief that a Republican contender will emerge, and he also hinted at the possibility of an independent candidate.\n\nDuring an interview, Flake stated, \"I do think the president will have a challenge from the Republican Party. I think there should be. I also think that there will be an independent challenge, particularly if the Democrats insist on putting somebody up from the far left of the party.\"\n\nFlake's comments come as President Trump has already announced his intention to run for a second term, citing his accomplishments in his first year, such as tax reform, a record number of judicial appointments, and the appointment of a new conservative justice to the Supreme Court.\n\nFlake's potential rival, Ohio's Republican Governor John Kasich, has been mentioned as a possible contender. However, Flake did not rule out his own presidential aspirations, leaving open the possibility of an independent run.\n\nThe relationship between Flake and Trump has been strained, with the two often butting heads on various issues. Last July, Flake published a book titled \"Conscience of a Conservative,\" in which he criticized Trump for leading the Republican Party to compromise its principles.\n\nIn response, Trump criticized Flake and Senator John McCain during a rally in Arizona last August, labeling them as \"weak\" on border security. The tension between the two reached a peak when Flake announced his retirement from the Senate in the fall, comparing Trump's rhetoric to that of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's.\n\nIf Flake decides to challenge Trump in 2020, the debates between the two would undoubtedly be a spectacle worth watching.",
    " Title: False Claims Act Under Scrutiny: A Look at Its Impact on Healthcare Industry\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a new working paper published by the Independence Institute, attorneys Mark W. Pearlstein and Laura McLane have highlighted the use and misuse of the False Claims Act (FCA) in the healthcare industry. The FCA, enacted in 1863 to combat fraudulent practices during the Civil War, is now being used to scrutinize and penalize healthcare providers for non-compliance with complex administrative standards, leading to increased costs, potential disruptions in care, and a chilling effect on the industry.\n\nThe FCA allows private individuals to sue anyone they believe is defrauding the federal government. Between 2009 and June 2016, over 4,700 FCA actions were filed, with awards ranging from $11,000 to $22,000 for each fraud detected, and treble damages. The spoils are divided among the person alleging the fraud, their attorneys, and the federal government. In 2014, the Department of Justice reported that FCA \"recoveries\" totaled $5.79 billion, with health care lawsuits accounting for $2.3 billion of that amount.\n\nOne of the concerns raised by Pearlstein and McLane is the lengthy and opaque investigation process. The initial investigation is conducted under seal, and defendants may be unaware of the investigation until their business documents are subpoenaed. The individual alleging fraud can proceed with a case even if the government decides against it.\n\nThe authors argue that the FCA's original intent was to prosecute fraud cases involving contractors billing the U.S. government for nonexistent or worthless goods, not to prosecute contractors for failing to adhere to specific manufacturing standards or minor differences of opinion. Instead, they suggest that the FCA is being used as a blunt instrument to extract large sums from healthcare businesses, potentially disrupting patient care and driving up costs.\n\nExamples of the FCA's impact on the healthcare industry include lawsuits against nursing homes, hospitals, doctors, insurers, clinical laboratories, pharmaceutical manufacturers, software providers, managed care organizations, and universities funded by federal grants. Allegations range from too little care, too much care, billing errors, record-keeping violations, and differences in opinion about medical necessity.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) certifies provider performance using various methods and has numerous administrative enforcement tools to influence the behavior of contractors in substantial but not complete compliance with its regulations. The HHS seeks to work with contractors to improve their performance rather than penalizing them with huge fines or shutting down facilities that are not in perfect compliance.\n\nOne notable case is United States ex rel. Drakeford v. Tuomey, in which a $237 million FCA verdict was upheld by the Fourth Circuit in 2015. The case involved a business entity related to Tuomey Regional Medical Center and part-time employment agreements with 19 surgeons and gastroenterologists. The physicians had agreed to use Tuomey facilities when they did procedures on their private patients. The plaintiffs argued that the contract violated the Stark Law because physicians who performed more procedures earned more.\n\nAfter 10 years of litigation, Tuomey settled with the federal government, paying $72.4 million and agreeing to sell itself to another health system. Many FCA defendants settle because they cannot afford to prove their innocence, and the government often requires signing a Corporate Integrity Agreement as part of the settlement terms, giving it control of the defendant's business activities for many years.\n\nIn the Tuomey case, the judge wrote that the hospital was caught in \"an impenetrably complex set of laws and regulations that will result in a likely death sentence for a community hospital in an already medically underserved area.\" He concluded that \"even for well-intentioned health care providers, the Stark Law has become a booby trap rigged with strict liability and potentially ruinous exposure\u2014especially when coupled with the False Claims Act.\"\n\nPearlstein and McLane's paper suggests that the aggressive use of the FCA in healthcare cases goes well beyond the traditional understanding of fraud. Unless Congress revises the statute, it will continue to harm patients by allowing routine second-guessing of physician decisions, raise costs by encouraging meritless whistle-blowing for money, and impair access to care as risk-averse participants bow out.\n\nLinda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Center at the Independence Institute, a free-market think tank in Denver, emphasizes the need for reform in the FCA to protect healthcare providers and ensure continued access to care for patients.",
    " Title: President Obama's West Coast Fundraising Tour Aims to Bolster Democratic Party in Tough Election Cycle\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to support the Democratic Party amidst a challenging election cycle, President Barack Obama embarked on a three-day fundraising tour across the West Coast. The tour aims to replenish the Democratic Party committees' coffers, providing them with the necessary resources to navigate the upcoming elections, particularly in the Senate.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act's controversial rollout and the ongoing debate over the law's implementation have left many Democrats, including vulnerable red-state senators and candidates, anxious about the law's future. Proposals to delay the individual mandate or implement more aggressive fixes to allow Americans to keep their insurance have been suggested by some Democrats.\n\nPresident Obama's job approval and favorability ratings have also taken a hit, according to a recent \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll. These sentiments could potentially impact Democrats running for re-election, as history suggests that a president's popularity can significantly impact the fortunes of his party in off-year elections.\n\nHowever, it is not uncommon for a president to face criticism, even within his own party. President Obama is not the first, nor will he be the last, to be viewed as a bogeyman by some Democrats. Poll numbers can be fleeting, and the government shutdown, for instance, seemed to have left Republicans in a weakened state, only for the GOP to regain momentum due to the health care law's early troubles.\n\nIf Democrats can refocus the message away from the health care law's issues and onto bread-and-butter economic issues, they may fare well in 2014, according to top Democratic pollster Joel Benenson. However, Obama is also facing criticism from Democratic activists who are frustrated with the lack of progress on other issues, such as immigration reform.\n\nThe timing of this fundraising swing could not have been worse for the president and his political team, according to Jim Manley, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and a Democratic strategist. Tickets to one of Obama's fundraisers were reportedly deeply discounted last week, and at an event on immigration reform in San Francisco, Obama was heckled by pro-immigration reform activists.\n\nRepublicans are capitalizing on the health care law's troubles, viewing its implementation as their greatest political advantage. As such, they are unlikely to shift attention away from the health care law to other issues like immigration reform or gun control. Even news of a potential deal on Iran's nuclear program this weekend prompted Republican Senator John Cornyn to suggest that the president was attempting to distract from the health care law's troubles.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether President Obama's numbers will rebound and whether 2014 will prompt a full-scale revolt among vulnerable or even potentially vulnerable Democrats running. However, in the meantime, the president's primary focus should be on extending a lifeline to his fellow Democrats, according to Bill Galston, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton and chair of the Brookings Institute's Governance Studies program.\n\n``The president's position now has to be that he will be inclined to do almost everything that the party asks him to do to get them out of a tough spot, which to some extent he's responsible for putting them in,'' Galston said.",
    " Title: Democrat Governors Pritzker and Whitmer Criticize President Trump's Handling of Coronavirus Protests, Immigration Policies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of interviews on Tuesday, Democrat Governors J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan criticized President Donald Trump's stance on the ongoing protests demanding the reopening of businesses and returning to work, accusing him of spreading fear and endangering the public.\n\nGovernor Pritzker, speaking to Washington Post reporter Robert Costa, expressed concern over Trump's tweets encouraging protesters in several states to \"LIBERATE.\" He described Trump's actions as a \"political maneuver in the middle of a national emergency\" and urged the President to cease such actions, stating, \"What could it mean? It could mean terrible things. You could end up with violence.\"\n\nPritzker also warned that large gatherings of protesters could lead to the spread of the coronavirus, potentially causing illness and death among the population. \"People gathering in large crowds will be giving each other coronavirus, and people, unfortunately, will get sick and some people may die as a result of the president\u2019s rhetoric that has brought them out to protest,\" he said.\n\nGovernor Whitmer, meanwhile, took issue with Trump's call to suspend immigration during the coronavirus crisis, stating that it was part of a series of \"inconsistent messages\" designed to instill fear and put the public at greater risk. Instead, she emphasized the need for increased production of coronavirus testing swabs, stating, \"This is what we need right now, not additional new things to be upset about, fearful of or mad about.\"\n\nWhitmer also dismissed suggestions that her criticisms of Trump's actions were an attempt to position herself as a potential running mate for presumptive Democrat nominee Joe Biden. Instead, she stated her focus was on managing the coronavirus crisis in her state. However, her strict measures, including bans on certain purchases and travel restrictions, have led to protests at the state capital, with some protesters advocating for a return to work as Michigan's unemployment rates soar. Over 1 million people in her state are currently unemployed due to closures under the governor's office or job losses since the outbreak began.\n\nIn conclusion, both Governors Pritzker and Whitmer have criticized President Trump's handling of the ongoing protests and his immigration policies, expressing concern that his actions could lead to increased danger and instability during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. They have also emphasized the need for increased production of coronavirus testing materials and a more consistent approach to messaging from the White House.",
    " Title: Trump Praises Pakistani Prime Minister in Inaugural Phone Call, Expresses Readiness for Diplomatic Engagement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move signaling his diplomatic strategy, President-elect Donald Trump expressed warm sentiments towards Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif during a phone call on Wednesday. The conversation, according to a readout provided by the Pakistani government, offered a glimpse into the forthcoming U.S.-Pakistan relations.\n\nTrump, in his characteristic effusive style, praised Sharif, stating, \"You have a very good reputation. You are a terrific guy. You are doing amazing work which is visible in every way.\" He also expressed his eagerness to engage with Pakistan, saying, \"I am looking forward to seeing you soon.\"\n\nThe call, which mirrored Trump's campaign rhetoric, saw Sharif congratulating the President-elect on his election victory and inviting him to visit Pakistan. In response, Trump expressed his admiration for the Pakistani people, stating, \"Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people.\"\n\nThe full readout of the call, as per the Pakistani government, is provided below. Trump's transition team has not released a readout of the call.\n\nAccording to the readout, Sharif called Trump to congratulate him on his victory. Trump responded by acknowledging Sharif's reputation, stating, \"You have a very good reputation. You are a terrific guy. You are doing amazing work which is visible in every way. I am looking forward to seeing you soon. As I am talking to you, Prime Minister, I feel I am talking to a person I have known for long. Your country is amazing with tremendous opportunities. Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people.\"\n\nTrump also expressed his readiness to play any role Pakistan wants him to play in addressing and finding solutions to outstanding issues. He also offered to be available for calls before his inauguration on January 20th. In response to Sharif's invitation to visit Pakistan, Trump said, \"I would love to come to a fantastic country, a fantastic place of fantastic people.\" He also expressed his admiration for the Pakistani people, stating, \"Please convey to the Pakistani people that they are amazing and all Pakistanis I have known are exceptional people.\"",
    " Title: Federal Court's Unprecedented Ruling on Trump's Travel Ban: A New Standard of Judicial Review Emerges\n\nArticle:\n\nA contentious decision by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has sparked debate and controversy, as it upholds a nationwide injunction on President Donald Trump's temporary halt on immigration from six majority-Muslim countries. This ruling, which has been dubbed \"Trumplaw,\" has been criticized for its departure from existing precedent and its potential impact on national security.\n\nThe court's ruling hinges on two key points. First, it asserts that Trump's campaign statements were so offensive to a Muslim resident that they granted him standing to challenge an executive order that did not apply to him. Second, the court determined that the harm caused to the plaintiff's feelings and potential delay in his wife's entry into the United States outweighed the government's asserted national-security interest in pausing immigration from these countries.\n\nThe novelty of Trumplaw makes it challenging to reconcile with established precedent. When existing precedent does not apply or contradicts the need to obstruct Trump's policies, the court is compelled to reinterpret and rewrite the law to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nOne example of this can be seen in the Fourth Circuit's interpretation of the Supreme Court case, Kleindienst v. Mandel. In Mandel, the U.S. government denied a non-immigrant visa to a Belgian Marxist journalist based on his advocacy of Marxist doctrines. The Supreme Court ruled that the courts should not look beyond the document to test the justification against the First Amendment interests of those seeking entry. However, the Fourth Circuit, in its ruling, argues that the court only considers the face of the document to determine if the reasons are legitimate, not if they are \"bona fide.\"\n\nJudge Paul Niemeyer's dissent in the Fourth Circuit's ruling is particularly scathing, stating that the majority's approach grants the court the power to search for evidence suggesting bad faith, which contradicts three Supreme Court opinions. The dissent argues that the majority's interpretation rejects long-standing holdings in favor of a politically motivated outcome.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit's ruling establishes a principle that a judge's dislike of a politician's campaign statements can taint actions that contradict those statements, even if they are clearly lawful. This principle is not limited to Trump's presidency, as it sets a precedent that could potentially impact future administrations.\n\nThe ruling comes in the aftermath of the Manchester bombing, which highlights the terrorist activity in one of the countries on the list, Libya. The bomber allegedly traveled to Libya and received help there. This incident underscores the real dangers of lawless regions gripped by jihad. The question remains: Is it unconstitutional to pause entry from a country to ensure proper vetting and screening for ISIS sympathizers? The Supreme Court has always said no. Today, the Fourth Circuit says yes. Today, the Fourth Circuit has chosen to distort the law and risk our national security to stop Donald Trump.\n\nDavid French, a senior writer for \u2588\u2588\u2588, a senior fellow at the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Institute, an attorney, and a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, has weighed in on the issue, expressing concern over the court's interpretation and its potential long-term implications.",
    " Title: Wind Power Averts Major Outages During Texas' Record Power Usage Amid Polar Vortex\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the face of record-breaking cold temperatures, Texas managed to avoid major power outages during the recent Polar Vortex, thanks in part to wind power. On Tuesday, the state's grid operator was forced to implement its emergency plan due to cold weather and power plant shutdowns, but increased output from West Texas wind farms helped mitigate the strain on the grid.\n\nThis is not the first time wind energy has played a crucial role in Texas' power management during extreme weather. In 2011, high wind outputs during peak demand helped the state's grid weather 100-plus temperatures. Similarly, wind energy is currently assisting other states in the Upper Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic region, where high wind energy output is helping to bolster the grid after some power plants failed due to the weather.\n\nHowever, this week's Polar Vortex has put the vulnerability of the U.S. energy grid in the spotlight. Parts of the Southeast U.S. experienced record electricity demand, with the Tennessee Valley Authority reporting that demand was the second-highest it's been in winter since the 1920s. As a result, parts of Tennessee lost power, and parts of South Carolina instituted rolling blackouts to manage the electricity demand.\n\nSevere weather is the leading cause of power outages in the U.S., and as extreme events become more common, the U.S. power grid will be increasingly at risk. Between 2003 and 2012, extreme weather caused over 675 power outages and cost the U.S. between $18 billion and $33 billion per year, according to a report by the President's Council of Economic Advisers and the Department of Energy. The report, released in August, also noted that transmission line construction in the U.S. has slowed significantly, with only 1,000 miles per year being built in the mid-2000s compared to 10,000 miles per year in the late 1960s. This slowdown means that about 70% of U.S. transmission lines and power transformers are over 25 years old.\n\nMassoud Amin, an electrical engineering professor at the University of Minnesota, estimates that updating the country to Smart Grid technology would cost $21 billion per year for the next two decades but would ultimately result in savings of between $79 and $94 billion per year. In a 2012 article for Forbes, Amin wrote, \"As a nation, we must take action to improve our electric grid if we want to meet the power needs of a pervasively digital society. Americans should not accept or learn to cope with increasing blackouts.\"",
    " Title: Conservative Groups Launch Ad Campaign, Town Hall Meetings to Defund Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) - Conservative groups are escalating their push to defund President Barack Obama's health care law, launching new advertisements and a series of town hall meetings starting this week. The new drive comes as a growing number of Republicans are resisting calls for a government shutdown over the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.\n\nHeritage Action for America, a leading political advocacy group, on Monday announced it would spend over half a million dollars to run online ads in the districts of 100 House Republican lawmakers who have not joined the drive to try and defund the healthcare law. Last month, Heritage Action joined 49 other conservative groups in demanding the House GOP leadership pass a bill to fund the government but not allow any money for Obamacare.\n\n\"The American people may have been locked out of the legislative process that gave us Obamacare, but they will be the force behind stopping this unworkable, unaffordable law. Congress should seize the moment and defund the entire law,\" said Heritage Action CEO Michael A. Needham, in a statement.\n\nThe announcement by Heritage Action comes on the same day that two other conservative groups, ForAmerica and Tea Party Patriots, also launched an online ad campaign targeting GOP senators and House Speaker John Boehner in an effort to persuade them to defund Obamacare.\n\nSome conservative lawmakers, including Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Mike Lee of Utah, are using upcoming budget battles as leverage, vowing to oppose any measure that provides funding for the federal government that includes funding for the health care law. The measure funding the federal government expires September 30, setting up another Capitol Hill budget battle between congressional Republicans and the White House.\n\nHowever, so far only slightly more than a dozen fellow Republican senators have signed up to support the cause, leaving it up to outside conservative groups to rally the base.\n\nThe announcement of internet ads by Heritage Action, which is a sister organization of the Heritage Foundation, one of the oldest and largest conservative think tanks, comes on the same day the group is launching a nine-stop \"Defund Obamacare Tour.\" Joining the series of townhalls, which kick off Monday in Fayetteville, Arkansas, are former Sen. Jim DeMint, the Heritage Foundation president, and Rafael Cruz, the father of Sen. Cruz. The senator from Texas will join DeMint and his father at the second town hall, Tuesday in Dallas.\n\nTwo progressive groups, Americans United for Change and Protect Your Care, plan counter-protests outside the townhalls.\n\n\"Pro-Health Reform advocates are going to meet the repealers and defunders on the battlefield and confront them directly and aggressively,\" says Brad Woodhouse, president of Americans United for Change. \"A strong majority of the American people want the Affordable Care Act implemented and fixed if necessary \u2013 they do not want it repealed \u2013 which is the only plan for health care Republicans have.\"\n\nAmericans appear divided on whether they want the law, which passed in 2010 along party lines when the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. In one of the most recent surveys on the law, conducted last month for CBS News, nearly four in ten called for the entire law to be repealed, with 18% saying that just the measure's controversial individual mandate should be repealed. Thirty-six percent of those questioned said that the law should be kept as is, or expanded.",
    " Title: Majority of Americans Support Universal Background Checks for Gun Purchases, Despite NRA Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll, 91% of Americans expressed support for universal background checks for gun purchases, with the margin reaching 88% to 11% among households with guns. This overwhelming majority indicates a significant shift in public opinion towards stricter gun control measures.\n\nJohn Donohue, a prominent figure in the gun control debate, attributes the opposition to these checks primarily to gun manufacturers and the National Rifle Association (NRA). Donohue argues that these groups, driven by profit motives, are the main force behind the NRA's resistance to universal background checks.\n\nGun manufacturers, according to Donohue, are concerned that background checks could interfere with total gun sales and profits. The checks would impose a minor burden on gun transactions, but more importantly, limit the size of the market (and therefore, profits) by closing the current gaping loophole in the background check system, thereby denying guns to criminals and the mentally ill.\n\nThe NRA has been accused of using fear tactics to oppose universal background checks, with some members fearing potential gun confiscation. In response to a question about future gun confiscation, 48% of respondents in the poll believed that if there are background checks for all gun purchases, the government will use that information to confiscate legally owned guns. However, this notion is widely considered delusional, given the minimal opposition to universal background checks and the constitutional protections for gun ownership.\n\nDespite the NRA's opposition, many other countries have similar requirements for gun purchases and significantly lower rates of murder and mayhem. Gun groups in the U.S. have raised alarmist concerns about the \"logistical nightmare\" of background checks for private sales, but these fears seem unfounded given the minimal impact on gun transactions and the potential benefits in terms of public safety.\n\nIn conclusion, the poll results indicate a strong public support for universal background checks, despite the NRA's opposition. The debate surrounding gun control measures is complex, but the overwhelming majority in favor of background checks suggests a desire for stricter regulations to prevent gun-related crimes.",

Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump in Miami, Florida on Friday to announce the White House's new Cuba policy. The event marked a shift from the Obama administration's approach to the island nation.\n\nRubio, who has been a vocal critic of the Cuban government, praised President Trump for his commitment to the Cuban people, who continue to grapple with the dictatorial rule of Raul Castro. Rubio shared that Trump had repeatedly asked him about Cuba since the election, expressing a deep concern for the island's political situation.\n\nPresident Trump, in his remarks, outlined several measures aimed at empowering the people of Cuba. He announced the cancellation of many provisions in the Obama administration's \"one-sided\" deal with the Castro regime. Trump emphasized the need to support the Cuban people, stating, \"With God's help, a free Cuba is what we will soon achieve.\"\n\nThe President criticized his predecessors for their failure to expose communism's inherent flaws. He pledged to reveal the crimes of the Castro regime, stating, \"Now that I am president, we will expose the crimes of the Castro regime.\"\n\nTrump detailed several demands his administration will be making of the Castro regime. These include the release of all political prisoners, the legalization of all parties, the scheduling of free elections, the restriction of U.S. dollars going to the military, the enforcement of the tourism and embargo, and the direct flow of investments to the people for private business development.\n\nThe President also demanded that Cuba stop harboring fugitives and criminals, using Joanne Chesimard, a fugitive who escaped from prison in 1979 and has been living in Cuba since gaining political asylum in 1984, as an example.\n\nThe event concluded with President Trump signing the new policy contract, reiterating, \"America will expose the crimes of the Castro regime and stand with the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom.\"",
    " Title: World Leaders Adapt Tactics to Navigate Diplomacy with President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nDiplomacy, a delicate dance of cultural understanding and political maneuvering, has taken on a unique twist in the era of President Donald Trump. As world leaders engage with the U.S. administration, they have found it necessary to adapt their approaches to cater to the President's distinct style.\n\nKing Salman bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia, for instance, has employed a strategy of flattery during his interactions with President Trump, as reported by Politico. During Trump's recent visit, the King welcomed him with a grand ceremony that included a military flyover, cannons, an elaborate cardamom coffee service, and the presentation of a gold medal - a level of adulation not extended to the last American president during his visit. This display of hospitality is seen as a reflection of King Salman's understanding of President Trump's preferences, a tactic that has been employed by leaders since Trump took office.\n\nThe New York Times recently compiled a checklist of dos and don'ts for leaders meeting with President Trump. The advice? Keep it concise, offer plenty of compliments, avoid lengthy monologues, and steer clear of political controversies.\n\nThis approach has been evident in meetings with other world leaders. British Prime Minister Theresa May described Trump's election win as \"stunning,\" while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referenced Trump's book, The Art of the Deal. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe even complimented Trump's golf swing.\n\nHowever, President Trump's approach to statecraft during his first day in Saudi Arabia was not as overt. First Lady Melania and daughter Ivanka, who accompanied the President, opted not to wear headscarves, despite President Trump's own deep knowledge of Middle Eastern manners. Yet, Trump did thank King Salman for the medal by dipping what appeared to be a tiny curtsey.\n\nIn this evolving landscape of diplomacy, leaders are learning to navigate the unique challenges posed by President Trump, adapting their strategies to maintain productive and respectful relationships.",
    " Title: ISIS Launches Offensive on Kirkuk, Clashes with Peshmerga Forces in Northern Iraq\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant escalation of hostilities, ISIS militants have launched an attack on the strategically important city of Kirkuk in northern Iraq. The assault, which may be an attempt to capture the oil-rich city or to divert Kurdish troops engaged in the fight to capture ISIS' stronghold of Mosul, has resulted in clashes with the Peshmerga, the armed forces protecting Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nThe attack began with a heavy assault on an abandoned hotel in central Kirkuk, which local police had previously used as their headquarters. Following the attack, Peshmerga and Kurdish anti-terror units regained control of the hotel, killing three ISIS militants and thwarting two suicide bombings.\n\nIn addition to the central Kirkuk attack, ISIS militants also took control of Maktab Khalid, an area about 12 miles southwest of Kirkuk, after heavy clashes with the Peshmerga. Among those killed was Brig. Gen. Shirko Fateh, the highest-ranking operational commander of the Peshmerga brigade located in Kirkuk.\n\nPhotos purportedly showing ISIS militants in control of parts of south and southwest Kirkuk have surfaced, depicting the burning of tents previously used by Peshmerga troops. The U.S. military reported that an ISIS chemical weapons expert was killed during a coalition strike last week.\n\nKirkuk, located on top of some of Iraq's largest oil reserves, is one of the few notable cities, apart from the Kurdistan region and its capital, Erbil, that have not fallen to ISIS. The city's oil reserves are almost as significant as those in southern Iraq, and control of these reserves has been a point of contention between the Kurds and the central Iraqi government in Baghdad.\n\nISIS has been coveting Kirkuk's oil reserves, as the group relies heavily on revenue from oil smuggling to fund its operations. Peshmerga forces took over the Kirkuk area in June when the Iraqi army crumbled in the face of ISIS' advances and have played a vital role in defending it from ISIS since.\n\nKirkuk has been the site of previous attacks, including a suicide car bomb attack in December that killed at least 17 people and injured more than 20. The city, however, is not the only place that has seen recent fighting, as ISIS has been fending off an offensive from Peshmerga fighters around Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.\n\nMosul, located on the Tigris River, has been held by ISIS since June and is a focal point for all sides in the conflict. ISIS has invested heavily in governing the city, with its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pronouncing his leadership of the caliphate at the Grand Mosque there in July.\n\nKurdish officials say that as long as ISIS holds Mosul, it threatens Kurdistan. Similarly, neither the government in Baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy Iraq's second-largest city. Peshmerga forces have made steady progress against ISIS north and west of Mosul over the past two months.\n\nIt is clear that ISIS remains a significant force and threat in much of Iraq. The group, which calls itself the Islamic State, still controls a vast swath of Middle Eastern nations and neighboring Syria. Its goal is to establish a vast caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law, with its followers proving they will stop at nothing, having been blamed for large-scale killings of civilians, mass kidnappings, and forcing women and girls to become sex slaves during its quest.\n\nViolence continued in other parts of Iraq on Friday, with clashes in central Ramadi and several explosions around Baghdad, leaving at least seven dead and 23 wounded. The ongoing conflict underscores the unsettled state of Iraq and the ongoing threat posed by ISIS.",
    " Title: Navigating the Past: A Question of Selective Erasure or Redemption for Progressive Heroes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding the removal of historical figures from public spaces, a question arises: Will progressives erase the history of their racist heroes, or only their racist enemies? This question, while complex, is a crucial one in the current climate of reevaluating the past.\n\nThe call for the elimination of symbols and figures from the past who do not meet contemporary moral standards is not without merit. For instance, the controversial figures of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general and a founding member of the Ku Klux Klan, and Roger B. Taney, the author of the Dred Scott decision, are examples of individuals whose public commemoration may be questionable.\n\nHowever, the pursuit of a 'clean' past could potentially lead progressives down a hypocritical path. This is particularly relevant when considering the founders of significant organizations, such as Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, who was an unapologetic racist and eugenicist. The question then arises: Should we disassociate Planned Parenthood from its founder, or should we acknowledge the organization's positive contributions while condemning the racist views of its founder?\n\nSimilarly, figures like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who made a racist remark about abortion, and Earl Warren, who supported the internment of Japanese Americans, are examples of individuals who, despite their significant contributions, have made statements or taken actions that are morally reprehensible by today's standards.\n\nThe question of what constitutes a 'proper' rule for exemption for progressives when waging war against the dead is a complex one. Do we tally up the good and bad deeds of historical figures to determine if they meet a 51% 'good progressive' threshold? Or do some reactionary sins cancel out all the progressive good?\n\nThe selective erasure of historical figures raises questions about the ultimate purpose of this process. Does toppling a statue or renaming a building improve racial relations or reduce unemployment in the inner city? Or is it a symbolic gesture that serves as a flashy signal of our superior virtue, while failing to address the root causes of systemic issues?\n\nAs we navigate the past, it is essential to approach these questions with nuance and understanding. The goal should not be to erase history, but to learn from it, to acknowledge the mistakes of the past, and to strive for a more equitable future. This process requires careful consideration, open dialogue, and a commitment to understanding the complexities of history.",
    " Title: An Analysis of Trump Derangement Syndrome: A Closer Look at the President's Tweets and Policy Decisions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the term \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" has been coined to describe a phenomenon where critics of President Donald Trump struggle to distinguish between legitimate policy differences and signs of psychopathology. This article aims to examine the validity of this syndrome, focusing on the President's climate change policy and his use of Twitter.\n\nTake Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as an example. The reaction was marked by hyperbole, with comments such as \"America just resigned as leader of the free world.\" However, it is crucial to consider the Paris Agreement itself, which lacked uniform commitments and enforcement provisions. China, for instance, pledged to \"achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030,\" implying a 13-year period of rising emissions.\n\nThe author argues that a strong, enforceable climate change pact, imposing relatively uniform demands on countries like China, India, the U.S., the E.U., and others, would be more effective. The Paris Agreement, in contrast, was deemed \"hot air.\" Withdrawing from the agreement was a plausible policy choice, given its weaknesses.\n\nThe focus then shifts to Trump's tweets, which are seen as a direct conduit from the unfiltered id. These tweets, particularly those mocking the Mayor of London after a terror attack, have been criticized as appalling. The author argues that these tweets, while unfiltered, can have significant consequences, as the world listens to the President's id.\n\nExamples of Trump's tweets include his use of London to support his travel ban, attacks on his own Justice Department, undermining the case for the travel ban as it goes to the Supreme Court, and his claims of already implementing \"extreme vetting,\" which contradicts the purpose of the travel ban.\n\nThe author also criticizes Trump's involvement in the Saudi Arabia-Qatar crisis, suggesting that it unnecessarily personalizes the issue and taints the endeavor by making it seem an American rather than an Arab initiative.\n\nThe article concludes by questioning the sustainability of Trump's behavior, quoting economist Herb Stein's statement, \"If something can not go on forever, it will stop.\" However, the author expresses doubt about what, short of a smoking gun produced by the Russia inquiry, would actually stop Trump's behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, this article provides a neutral analysis of Trump Derangement Syndrome, focusing on the President's climate change policy and his use of Twitter. It argues that while Trump's behavior can be unconventional and controversial, it is crucial to distinguish between legitimate policy differences and signs of psychopathology.",
    " Title: First Lady Michelle Obama's Alleged Racial Experiences Sparks Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an exclusive interview with People magazine, First Lady Michelle Obama shared her experiences of alleged racist encounters, sparking a wave of debate and criticism. The first lady recounted a supposedly distressing incident at a Target store, where she was asked to help a woman reach a shelf.\n\nMrs. Obama described such incidents as \"the regular course of life\" for African-Americans and a \"challenge\" for the country to overcome. However, critics argue that the incident, in which a shopper asked for help, is not an example of racism but rather a matter of common courtesy between equals.\n\nThe first lady's account of the Target incident has been met with skepticism, as it bears a striking resemblance to a 2012 anecdote she shared on David Letterman's show, where she recounted the same incident as a feel-good story devoid of discrimination. On the late-night talk show, Mrs. Obama chuckled and shared how she reached up to help the shopper, who commented on her ease, and she felt good about the interaction.\n\nCritics argue that the first lady's shopping fable has become increasingly absurd, with her transformation from an overjoyed regular mom to an oppressed martyr. Some have taken to social media to call out the first lady for her alleged fabrication of racial tall tales for political gain.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Mrs. Obama's account of the Target incident has brought attention to her past, including her senior thesis at Princeton University, titled \"Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.\" In the thesis, she decried her racial otherness and accused her university of pushing her towards \"further integration and/or assimilation into a white cultural and social structure.\"\n\nHowever, critics point out that it was a white male Princeton alum who played a significant role in her career advancement. Stephen Carlson, a corporate law partner at Sidley and Austin, offered generous career guidance and mentoring while she was an undergrad and again when she was at Harvard Law. Mrs. Obama secured a coveted job as a summer associate in 1987, accepted a full-time job upon graduation, and never looked back.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Mrs. Obama's account of the Target incident has sparked a broader discussion about the use of race as a political tool and the importance of accuracy in sharing personal experiences.",
    " Title: Democrats' Unforced Errors in Impeachment Trial Pave Way for Trump's Acquittal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Senate's decision to shut down the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump without further witness testimony, it appears that Democrats may have made several unforced errors that contributed to the outcome. From Speaker Nancy Pelosi's delay in transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate, to Senator Elizabeth Warren's controversial questioning of Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., Democrats found ways to alienate even those Republicans who might have been inclined to support a more comprehensive trial.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, suggested that Warren's move may have been the most damaging. In a podcast episode released late Friday, Cruz stated, \"Elizabeth Warren helped defeat the impeachment of the president of the United States. That stunt helped deliver the votes of Lisa and Lamar.\"\n\nLisa is Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, and Lamar is Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee. With their support, the Senate voted 51-49 on Friday to set rules for the rest of the impeachment trial that do not allow for any more witnesses or motions.\n\nWarren's move may have been the biggest mistake, but it was not the only one. During the last two weeks of presentations and questions and answers, Democrats made several other missteps. One such misstep was when Representative Adam Schiff, the chief impeachment prosecutor, suggested that the White House was threatening Republicans to line up behind Trump or else their head would be \"on a pike.\" Republican senators say no such threats had been made, and for Schiff to suggest it irked key GOP lawmakers.\n\nAnother misstep was Warren's attempt to drag Chief Justice Roberts into the political fray. In a question, Warren wrote, \"At a time when large majorities of Americans have lost faith in government, does the fact that the chief justice is presiding over an impeachment trial in which Republican senators have thus far refused to allow witnesses or evidence contribute to the loss of legitimacy of the chief justice, the Supreme Court, and the Constitution?\"\n\nSchiff, who fielded the question, said he wouldn't question the chief justice's role, but agreed with Warren that the trial was not fair. Democrats in the final days of last week made several other efforts to try to rope the chief justice into the political fray, including offering a proposal to have the Senate outsource key decisions over witnesses and evidence to him.\n\nSenator Murkowski, in her statement Friday explaining why she opposed witnesses after seeming to be supportive of the concept earlier in the week, said it had \"become clear some of my colleagues intend to further politicize this process, and drag the Supreme Court into the fray, while attacking the chief justice.\"\n\n\"I will not stand for nor support that effort,\" she said. \"We have already degraded this institution for partisan political benefit, and I will not enable those who wish to pull down another.\"\n\nIn the case of a 50-50 tie, the chief justice would have been under pressure to cast a tie-breaking vote. With Murkowski in board, the GOP was able to avoid that and preserve the chief justice's independence. Chief Justice Roberts made clear he would have declined to cast a vote anyway.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer, the Democrats' floor leader, pointed out that a previous Chief Justice had cast tie-breaking votes in 1868 in the trial of President Andrew Johnson. However, Chief Justice Roberts countered that he didn't see those isolated incidents as enough precedent for him to insert himself into the highly charged political proceedings of another branch of government in 2020.\n\nWith a final vote set for Wednesday at 4 p.m., Trump is certain to be acquitted, since the Senate won't come close to mustering the two-thirds majority needed for a conviction on impeachment. Democrats complained that a trial without witnesses would not be legitimate, and said any subsequent acquittal would always have an asterisk. However, Republicans countered that Democrats bungled the impeachment in the House, denying Trump fair rights and delivering two articles that were fatally flawed.",
    " Title: Transgender Employee Fired After Allegedly Harassing Conservative Customer at Cultiva Espresso & Crepes\n\nArticle:\n\nA heated incident occurred at Cultiva Espresso & Crepes in Lincoln, Nebraska, on Wednesday, when a transgender employee reportedly harassed a conservative customer, Marilyn Synek, due to her political affiliations.\n\nSynek, a 23-year-old communications specialist, told the Washington Examiner that the employee approached her, called her by name, and began yelling profanities at her. The employee asked Synek to leave and informed her that she would be denied service due to her \"bigoted\" views.\n\nAccording to Synek, the employee, identified as Natalie Weiss, declared, \"You are f*cking bigoted trash, and we do not want you in our restaurant.\" Weiss also reportedly stated, \"Over 80 percent of the people who work here are queer. You are not f*cking wanted in our restaurant, so get out and don't come back!\"\n\nWeiss later wrote on Facebook that when Synek was leaving the store, she told her in no uncertain terms, and admittedly vulgar ones, that she was not welcome to return. Weiss also stated that Nebraska Family Alliance, an organization Synek had volunteered for and supports, is a \"bigoted anti-LGBT2QIA+ organization who lobbies every year for legalized discrimination against my community in my state.\"\n\nCultiva Espresso & Crepes management wrote on Facebook that the employee in question was \"fired almost immediately\" following the incident. The management stated, \"We're proudly liberal personally, and believe in human rights and diversity to the fullest degree. However, we would never condone treating a customer this way.\"\n\nThe management further explained that they run a business and try to instill professionalism in their staff, usually successfully. They added that they welcome anyone as long as they are not harassing customers or staff members, committing crimes, damaging property, etc.\n\nWeiss, in a subsequent Facebook post, expressed her dissatisfaction with the coffee shop's response, stating, \"Cultiva Espresso & Crepes, you just let neo-conservative Trump allies drive out a trans employee.\" Weiss also wrote, \"So, for those keeping track, in Nebraska, you can be fired or lose your home because you identify in the LGBT2QIA+ umbrella, and you can also be fired for telling people who fight for that status quo to get lost.\"\n\nAccording to the Lincoln Journal Star, Synek said that while she believes Americans can disagree politically, she hopes the incident demonstrates the need for civility. Synek also noted that the coffee shop's owners apologized to her personally and asked her to come back, the paper said. Synek added, \"I've always enjoyed their coffee and crepes, and I accept their apology.\"",
    " Title: Former Senator John Edwards Acquitted on One Count, Mistrial Declared in Corruption Case\n\nArticle:\n\nJohn Edwards, the former Democratic presidential candidate, walked out of a federal courthouse in North Carolina on Thursday afternoon following a mistrial declaration in his high-profile corruption case. The jury found him not guilty on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions but were deadlocked on the remaining five counts, leading to the mistrial decision by Judge Catherine Eagles.\n\nThe former senator expressed gratitude to the jury and stated, \"I don't think God's through with me,\" after the verdict. The Department of Justice has not yet announced whether they will seek to retry Edwards. However, a law enforcement official told Fox News that it is unlikely the Justice Department will pursue a retrial.\n\nIn an emotional statement on the courthouse steps, Edwards spoke of his love for his daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, whom he fathered with his former mistress, Rielle Hunter. He also expressed hope for the future, stating, \"I really believe [God] thinks there's still some good things I can do.\"\n\nEdwards acknowledged his wrongdoings, stating, \"There is no one else responsible for my sins, I am responsible.\" He praised the jury, saying they \"took their job very, very seriously.\"\n\nThe trial, which lasted over a month, brought to light lurid testimony about Edwards' extramarital affair during the 2008 campaign. The trial focused on charges that Edwards knowingly had nearly $1 million in donations channeled to his mistress to keep her silent and prevent the affair from derailing his presidential bid. The defense argued that he was merely trying to keep the secret from his wife.\n\nThe one count on which Edwards was acquitted was a charge that he received campaign contributions from wealthy donor Rachel \"Bunny\" Mellon in excess of the legal limit in 2008. The mistrial announcement followed a day marked by confusion and miscommunication at the North Carolina courthouse. The jury had only reached a verdict on one count, leading to the defense's request for a mistrial. The maximum sentence Edwards faced was 30 years in prison.",
    " Title: Media Outlets Question Legitimacy of June Jobs Report Amidst Rising COVID-19 Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the June jobs report, released on Thursday, showed a significant improvement with 4.8 million added jobs and the unemployment rate dropping to 11.1 percent. However, several broadcast network evening newscasts have questioned the legitimacy of the report due to the recent surge in coronavirus cases across the country.\n\nABC, CBS, and NBC collectively presented a \"reality check\" due to the report being based on data collected before the recent spike in coronavirus cases. They suggest that the economy could face another setback as a result.\n\nCBS Evening News anchor Margaret Brennan stated, \"The President celebrates as the economy adds nearly five million jobs, but will that work dry up as businesses are forced to shut down again?\" During two segments totaling over three minutes, Brennan emphasized the \"big catch\" associated with the positive report.\n\nCBS correspondent Adriana Diaz warned that the \"welcome news\" came with a \"catch\" since the data was collected before many states experienced a resurgence in coronavirus cases. She also highlighted that the unemployment rates for Black and Hispanic workers were significantly higher than the national average, at 14.5 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively.\n\nWhite House correspondent Weijia Jiang, known for her critical stance towards the Trump administration, further questioned the report's legitimacy and praised Joe Biden for his criticism of the President's optimism.\n\nNBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt also expressed skepticism, stating that the \"record number\" did not tell the whole story. White House correspondent Peter Alexander echoed this sentiment, suggesting that while Americans were returning to work faster than expected, many of the jobs reported were not new positions but rather furloughed workers returning to their old jobs.\n\nABC's World News Tonight ran a chyron during the opening teases stating, \"Recovery Reality Check.\" Weekend anchor Tom Llamas warned that while the report was \"good news,\" critics were \"cautious\" due to 19 states either reversing course on reopening or slowing down their reopening plans.\n\nChief business correspondent Rebecca Jarvis provided a slightly more balanced perspective, acknowledging the record rehiring but also pointing out that many states have started to roll back or pause their reopening plans this month.\n\nThese dismissals of the June jobs report were made possible by advertisers such as IBM (on ABC), Capital One (on CBS), and Liberty Mutual (on NBC).

    " Title: Political Tensions Mount as Congress and Presidential Candidates Prepare for Supreme Court Vacancy Battle\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Congress and the presidential field have found themselves in a heated dispute over the process of filling the vacancy. The passing of Justice Scalia, who was 79 and found dead in his room at a West Texas resort, has sparked a fast-moving debate that pits Democrats against Republicans, with each side citing the U.S. Constitution to support their arguments.\n\nDemocrats argue that the Constitution compels President Obama to nominate a successor, while Republicans contend that the founding document will become irrelevant if the court tilts to the left. Senate Democrats have stated that they cannot find a constitutional clause that prevents President Obama from filling the vacancy, while Republicans argue that the high court can function with eight members, allowing voters to shape its future.\n\nThe debate began shortly after the news of Justice Scalia's death on Saturday, with Senate Democrats urging President Obama to send them a nominee and the Republican majority vowing to ignore it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, has already ruled out a vote this year, stating that the American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice.\n\nThe Supreme Court is poised to rule this term on several contentious issues, including President Obama's amnesty program for certain illegal immigrants, the application of Obamacare's birth control rules to religious nonprofits, and whether public-sector unions can collect fees from workers who do not join.\n\nThe standoff adds a remarkable wrinkle to an already challenging year on Capitol Hill, with Republicans in charge of both chambers stating that there are few opportunities for bipartisan agreement. Instead, the focus is on putting forth an agenda of \"ideas,\" offering voters a clear contrast to President Obama's agenda. The debate is already spilling onto the campaign trail, with presidential candidates discussing the importance of nominating a worthy successor to Justice Scalia.",
    " Title: Congress Urges Obama to Request Authorization for Use of Military Force Against ISIS\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a growing chorus of criticism, members of Congress from both sides of the aisle are urging President Obama to take action in formally requesting an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against the Islamic State (ISIS). Two weeks ago, President Obama promised a debate on how to conduct the war against ISIS, but lawmakers are frustrated that the president has yet to make such a request.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told The Washington Times, \"The process should come from him. He\u2019s the commander in chief. If he feels he needs this authority, he wants this authority, then he should be the leader. He should write down what he\u2019s looking for in terms of authority and let us debate it.\"\n\nSen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) also expressed his frustration, telling The Washington Times, \"I have always felt that we should be continuing on an AUMF, but it\u2019s a little difficult when the administration doesn\u2019t produce any witnesses. So either they want an AUMF or they don\u2019t.\"\n\nBill O'Reilly, host of \"The O'Reilly Factor\" on Fox News Channel, noted the recent beheading of Peter Kassig, 26, of Indiana by ISIS, saying, \"The bad guys are winning and the president seems hesitant to do what's necessary to turn things around. He can talk all he wants. Meantime, Americans are being murdered.\"\n\nFormer defense secretary Robert Gates, who served under President Obama, stated that Iraqi troops need U.S. special operations troops on the ground in order to defeat ISIS. Bernadette Meehan of the National Security Council told The Washington Times that \"the administration continues to have conversations with members of both parties regarding an AUMF to suit the current fight and our current strategy against ISIS.\"\n\nHowever, Sen. Graham says a written request is needed. \"I think he doesn't want to make that hard decision,\" he told The Washington Times. \"He doesn't want to write down on a piece of paper what he would like Congress to do because he's afraid of the left.\"\n\nThe Washington Post commented that \"Mr. Obama appears to recognize the severity of the threat posed by the Islamic State (ISIS) and appears to be focused on the job of leading the fight against it. But if he continues to allow his ideological resistance to steps such as the deployment of ground forces to constrain the campaign, he will ensure its failure.\"\n\nPresident Obama has stated that a final resolution on the approach to the campaign against ISIS \"may carry over into the next Congress,\" The Washington Times noted. The New York Times argued that instead of waiting on Obama to act, Congress should take action immediately on its own. \"Increasingly, it seems as if the current lame-duck Congress will leave the issue to the next one,\" the Times wrote. \"The priority in the lame-duck session should be to pass a new and separate authorization for the war against ISIS.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Decision on Obamacare Subsidies Leaves Health Insurance Market in Limbo\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - The recent flip-flopping by President Donald Trump on the issue of maintaining Obamacare subsidies to insurers has created uncertainty over the availability and affordability of health insurance for consumers, as the 2018 enrollment period begins in two weeks.\n\nLast week, Trump announced his administration would cease paying billions of dollars in subsidies that help insurers offer discounts to low-income households, one of several moves to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, signed into law by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\nHowever, since then, Trump has shown support and dismissed an effort by Republican and Democratic senators to reinstate the subsidies for two years, until a broader replacement for the 2010 healthcare law can be negotiated.\n\nBryna Koch, special projects coordinator at the Arizona Center for Rural Health, expressed concern that consumers on Obamacare plans may be deterred from seeking assistance due to the ongoing policy changes. \"We are worried that consumers on (Obamacare) plans will be confused by all the back and forth and proposed policy changes,\" she said.\n\nTrump, who campaigned on a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he has called a \"disaster,\" has argued that the subsidies amount to a bailout for insurance companies. By law, health insurers must still offer discounts on deductibles, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket costs, even if the government stops reimbursing them. Insurers claim they do not profit from the subsidies.\n\nAnticipating Trump's move, insurers proposed higher premiums for 2018 to recoup the lost funding. In all but a handful of states, they submitted two sets of premium rates \u2013 a lower rate to use if the subsidies remained, and a higher rate to use if the funding was cut.\n\nThe fate of the subsidies remains uncertain, with the White House indicating that Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation. This casts doubt on the prospects for the bipartisan effort to stabilize insurance markets.\n\nA California court is expected to consider a request by Democratic attorneys general to keep the subsidies flowing until a legal challenge to Trump's decision is resolved. If the funding is not restored when 2018 enrollment opens on Nov. 1, many consumers will see premium rates that are on average 20 percent higher than they would have been otherwise.\n\nEven before Trump's decision on the subsidies, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the Republican president's policies to roll back Obamacare enrollment efforts would lead to 4 million fewer people signing up for insurance in 2018 than previously forecast. The CBO still expects 11 million people to sign up for next year - an increase from this year's enrollment of 10 million.\n\nThe federal government has already halted a subsidy payment to the insurance industry for October. However, leading insurers are not yet sure whether that is the last word. Anthem Inc Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he could not yet predict how ending the subsidies or restoring them through \"potential congressional action\" would affect pricing next year. Anthem has submitted premium rates that account for the subsidies being cut.\n\nShould the subsidies be restored at any time after Nov. 1, insurers may be able to revert to the lower monthly premium rates, or provide rebates for consumers. \"A midyear change in premiums would be highly unusual, but this would be the right thing to do,\" said Marc Harrison, CEO of Intermountain Healthcare, a Utah-based health plan and hospital chain. \"Intermountain Healthcare would pursue this.\"\n\nWashington state's insurance regulator said it would allow insurers to change rates as soon as practical - even the next month - if lawmakers reinstate the funding, an approach backed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. However, this could run up against federal government objections, as the Affordable Care Act does not allow for changes to premium rates after they have been finalized. The administration is also working to approve higher rates in several states that did not take into account Trump's cut in subsidies for 2018.",
    " Title: Hungary Declares State of Emergency, Deploys Military to Border Amid Migration Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nHungary has declared a state of emergency in two of its southeastern counties, a move that allows the deployment of the military to the border with Serbia in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants entering the country. The state of emergency, which grants authorities increased powers to manage the crisis, includes the ability to shut down roads, limit the functioning of public institutions, and expedite court processes for asylum-seekers.\n\nThe announcement comes as Hungary also enacted tougher laws on Tuesday aimed at preventing asylum-seekers from entering the country. The new legislation makes it a crime to attempt to breach the razor-wire fence along the border with Serbia and includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.\n\nHungarian officials closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday. On Monday, a record 9,380 migrants entered Hungary, surpassing the previous record of 5,809 set the day before. Nearly 200,000 migrants have entered Hungary in 2015, with the majority transiting the country en route to Germany or other Western European nations.\n\nUnder the new laws, most migrants entering Hungary from Serbia can be turned away because Serbia is considered a safe country and could potentially offer asylum. The new law also criminalizes damage to the 4-meter razor-wire fence that Hungary has built on its 110-mile border with Serbia, giving police the power to detain anyone attempting to breach it.\n\nThe state of emergency allows the government to mobilize the army, pending parliamentary approval next week, to assist police with border control. Courts are also required to prioritize cases involving migrants caught entering Hungary illegally. Police can enter and search homes where illegal migrants are believed to be hiding.\n\nGermany's interior minister, Thomas de Maiziere, on Tuesday expressed support for the idea of withholding European Union funding from countries that refuse to share the refugee burden. Several EU countries, particularly those in the former Eastern bloc, have rejected calls for mandatory refugee quotas from Germany and the EU's executive commission.\n\nDe Maiziere suggested that there should be discussions about exerting pressure, and that countries rejecting quotas often receive significant amounts of EU funding. He also agreed with Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker's suggestion that \"we should talk about (them) getting less money from the structural funds.\"",
    " Title: Local Politics Shift Towards Bipartisan Approach Amidst Federal Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the federal government shutdown continues, a new trend is emerging in local politics across the United States. Rather than the traditional red and blue divide, politicians are adopting a more pragmatic, bipartisan approach to governance.\n\nFrom Indiana to California, Republican and Democratic leaders are emulating each other's policies. Indiana's Republican Governor, Mike Pence, announced Tuesday that the state will fund food stamps and welfare checks during the shutdown. In Wisconsin, Republican Governor Scott Walker, known for his battles with public sector labor unions, has removed barriers to a federally supported boat launch on the Mississippi and is funding state parks that were ordered shut down due to their reliance on federal funds.\n\nIn California, Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, who has been reluctant to announce plans to help those affected by the shutdown, is being praised for his fiscal conservatism. This shift in approach is being hailed as a sign of the times by David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, California.\n\n\"It's no longer the suburbs versus the cities, it's about delivering services to the people,\" McCuan says, referencing an old adage that there are no Democratic or Republican streets, only American streets. He predicts that this tone will rise to the national level as well, with increasing calls for moderates in both parties to find common ground.\n\nPoliticians' decisions are not without political motivations, notes government policy attorney Leonard Wolfe from the law firm Dykema in Lansing, Michigan. \"Politicians who are up for reelection want to show that they are in control of their state,\" he says, explaining that the average voter does not differentiate between state and federal funding for government services.\n\n\"People want to know why they can't get into their parks or receive their benefits check,\" Wolfe says, adding that they are not interested in partisanship. \"They expect their local politicians to be able to help,\" he says. Consequently, politicians are making gestures that signal, \"I am in control here.\"\n\nRepublican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey has recently released a campaign ad with the slogan, \"Compromise is not a dirty word.\" However, there are limits to how much local politicians can \"bail out\" the federal government, even when they are inclined to do so, points out Christine Kelleher-Palus, associate professor and chair of Villanova University's Department of Public Administration in Philadelphia.\n\nThe recent economic downturn has left states in a difficult position, she says via email, and they are struggling in many areas due to the shutdown. \"States are doing a lot of analyses and contingency planning \u2013 trying to figure out how individual programs are affected, and for how long they can be sustained,\" she says.\n\nPoliticians' responses to the shutdown are unpredictable, notes political analyst Barbara O' Connor, director emeritus of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State University, Sacramento. \"He terrifies Republicans because they can't count on him to toe the party line,\" she notes about New Jersey's Governor Christie. However, with the safety net being threatened for an ever-widening group of constituents, \"we are facing an interesting dynamic with politicians,\" she says. \"There are more and more willing to do the helpful thing.\"\n\nShe points out that in California, Governor Brown has also been a source of unexpected moves, a trend she expects to continue. The bigger question, she says, is how more extreme politicians will respond as the shared pain spreads among constituents. \"It's an interesting drama, and we don't know how it will play out,\" she concludes.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates Face Challenges in Winning Over Voters in Iowa and New Hampshire\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the Democratic presidential nomination, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are facing political vulnerabilities that have hindered their ability to present a compelling vision to a majority of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nFormer Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis, who was the Democratic presidential nominee in 1988, expressed concern over the current tax system's skewed nature and the lack of significant tax payments by big companies. He stated, \"The vast majority of people should be doing better in this economic recovery, but 'Why aren't we?' they ask. Bernie is talking right to them.\"\n\nHowever, both candidates have faced scrutiny. Critics question Mr. Sanders' electability, despite his strong performance in polls against potential Republican opponents. The impact of his tax plans is yet to resonate with voters, and concerns persist about his foreign policy experience and reluctance to intervene in overseas conflicts.\n\nFor his supporters, Mr. Sanders' vision for the party is inspiring. Erin Bilbray, a Nevada Democrat who ran for Congress in 2014, expressed her support, stating, \"Being a Bernie Sanders Democrat means loving my country so much that I am willing to sacrifice to pay for its education and health care.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Mrs. Clinton grapples with lingering negative sentiments among some voters who view her as too close to Wall Street and too hawkish on foreign policy, as evidenced by her vote to authorize the Iraq war (which Mr. Sanders opposed). In a recent CNN/WMUR poll of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, 55 percent labeled Mrs. Clinton as the least honest candidate in the field, compared to 46 percent in December.\n\nThis article aims to provide an unbiased account of the challenges faced by both candidates in their bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, highlighting the concerns and aspirations of their supporters and the criticisms leveled against them.",
    " Title: White House and Democrats Defend Attorney General Eric Holder Against Contempt Proceedings, Citing Executive Privilege\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on Thursday, Democrats went on the offensive against the contempt proceedings against Attorney General Eric Holder, with the White House labeling the campaign as a \"fishing expedition\" and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accusing Republicans of targeting Holder due to his department's crackdown on state voter ID laws.\n\nWhile Republicans have left open the possibility of averting a full House contempt vote next week, Democrats indicated they were prepared to fight rather than comply with the Republican-led probe into Operation Fast and Furious by surrendering the disputed documents.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney described the situation as a \"political fishing expedition\" on Thursday. Pelosi, in a press briefing earlier in the day, suggested the anti-Holder push was part of a broader scheme to \"suppress\" the vote.\n\n\"They are going after Eric Holder because he is trying to overturn voter suppression in the states. This is a plan,\" Pelosi said.\n\nWhen asked about Pelosi's claim, Carney said he could not \"divine\" Republicans' motivation for pursuing the contempt case against Holder. However, he defended both Holder and President Obama for asserting executive privilege over the documents Republicans are seeking.\n\n\"Those kinds of deliberations have been protected under privilege as a matter of the separation of powers...dating back 30 years,\" Carney said, describing the documents in question as \"internal Executive Branch documents.\"\n\nRepublicans, who voted in favor of contempt at the committee level on Wednesday, are seeking more than 70,000 additional documents to answer questions on Fast and Furious. They expressed frustration with Obama's eleventh-hour privilege claim and suggested the White House was acknowledging involvement in Fast and Furious discussions by asserting privilege over the documents.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner went further on Thursday, stating, \"The decision to invoke executive privilege is an admission that White House officials were involved in decisions that misled the Congress and have covered up the truth.\" He questioned, \"What is the Obama administration hiding in Fast and Furious?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., added his name to the list of lawmakers calling for Holder's resignation.\n\nThe White House and Justice Department, however, downplayed the potential implications of the executive privilege claim. Justice Department officials noted that the privilege assertion does not have to pertain to communications involving the president or White House staff. Any \"deliberative communications\" among officials in the Executive Branch, they said, could be covered.\n\nIn other words, they argued that just because Obama is locking down the documents does not mean he had anything to do with the Fast and Furious discussions. Executive privilege has been invoked 24 times since the presidency of Ronald Reagan. This was Obama's first time asserting it.",
    " Title: Legal Battle Ensues as Trump Team Seeks to Halt Release of Explosive White House Book\n\nArticle:\n\nA legal battle is underway as lawyers for U.S. President Donald Trump are attempting to prevent the release of a book containing damaging allegations about his administration. The book, titled \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" cites former top aide Steve Bannon as describing a meeting with a group of Russians as \"treasonous.\" The book also portrays Mr. Trump as being surprised at winning the presidency.\n\nDespite the legal threat, the book's publishers have brought its release forward. Initially scheduled for Tuesday, the book's author, Michael Wolff, announced that it would now be available for purchase on Friday. The White House has disputed the book's accuracy. Mr. Trump earlier said Mr. Bannon, who was dismissed in August, had \"lost his mind\" after losing his White House position.\n\nAmong a number of explosive statements, Mr. Bannon reportedly said, referring to a Trump Tower meeting between top campaign officials and Russia, \"They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV.\" The meeting, which involved Mr. Trump's eldest child Donald Trump Jr., is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia to win the election.\n\nOn his Breitbart radio show on Wednesday, Mr. Bannon responded to the president's criticism by saying he was a \"great man\" and that he supported him \"day in and day out.\" After the president met Republican senators in the Oval Office to discuss immigration on Thursday, a reporter asked Mr. Trump if his former strategist had betrayed him. He responded, \"I don't know, he called me a great man last night so he obviously changed his tune pretty quick.\"\n\nThe legal notice, which has been published by the Washington Post, demands that author Michael Wolff and the book's publisher \"immediately cease and desist from any further publication, release or dissemination of the book.\" It accuses Wolff of making \"numerous false and/or baseless statements\" about Mr. Trump and says lawyers are considering pursuing libel charges.\n\nThe lawyers base their notice on excerpts of the book published in publications including New York Magazine and ask for a full copy of the book to be sent to them. The letter says the book \"appears to cite to [sic] no sources for many of its most damaging statements about Mr. Trump\" and that many claims are made without citing sources. Neither Wolff nor the publisher, Henry Holt and Co Inc, have yet responded.\n\nThe attorney who wrote the letter, Charles J. Harder, has been called Hollywood's favorite lawyer. He represents Jared Kushner, and represented wrestler Hulk Hogan in his case against now-defunct news website Gawker. Mr. Harder also briefly represented disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein. He sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mr. Bannon on Wednesday, saying he had violated a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nThe book is reportedly based on more than 200 interviews, but some of the book's excerpts have already been criticized and questioned. Still, even if only half of what the book contains is true, it paints a damning portrait of a paranoid president and a chaotic White House, according to BBC North America editor Jon Sopel.\n\nDonald Trump might want to familiarize himself with the so-called Streisand Effect. The lesson, most prominently learned by singer Barbra Streisand when she tried to quash photographs of her home that appeared on an obscure website, is that the more you fight against undesirable news, the more you call attention to it.\n\nThanks to his lawyer's \"cease and desist\" letter, Mr. Trump is giving Michael Wolff and his explosive book the kind of massive publicity boost money alone can't buy. The highly critical allegations are leading every news program and newspaper front page (and burying the latest round of glowing U.S. economic news that might otherwise garner attention).\n\nThreatening lawsuits is a common tactic for Mr. Trump, dating back to his days as a New York real estate mogul. Very seldom does he follow up with actual court action. In this case, such a move would be particularly risky. To meet the \"actual malice\" requirement of U.S. libel law, the president would open himself up to investigation from opposing lawyers seeking to prove that Wolff's allegations had substance - or, at the very least, that he had reason to believe they did.\n\n\"Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,\" Mr. Trump said in a statement on Wednesday. Press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed the book as a \"trashy tabloid fiction\" that she said was \"filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Melania Trump said the First Lady had encouraged her husband's presidential bid. \"She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did,\" she said on Wednesday. On Thursday, the White House said it was banning personal devices, including mobile phones, from the West Wing, citing security concerns.\n\nIn researching the book, Wolff said he had been able to take up \"something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing\" following the president's inauguration.",
    " Title: Allegations of National Security Advisor's Connection to George Soros Raise Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of reports, domestic and foreign intelligence sources have alleged that National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster is an operative of globalist billionaire George Soros. The claims suggest that McMaster is a foreign intelligence agent for a multi-national combine controlled by Soros, which may explain his perceived efforts to obstruct President Trump's agenda.\n\nRoger Stone, a correspondent for \u2588\u2588\u2588, reported that he has received confirmation from sources within the White House, the Israeli government, and Israeli intelligence that McMaster has been communicating with Soros, providing insights into the workings of the White House. Stone claims to have corroborated this information with two high-ranking sources within Israeli intelligence, and anticipates the Israeli ambassador to the US to confirm these allegations.\n\nThe implication of these claims is that McMaster may be a primary leaker, given Soros' extensive ties to the mainstream media. It is known that McMaster was a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an organization funded by Soros' Open Society Foundation and another Soros-financed group.\n\nLast month, Israel publicly accused Soros of undermining democratically-elected governments. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized Soros when it spoke out against the vandalism of anti-Soros posters in Hungary, which were defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti. The ministry stated that it deplores any expression of anti-Semitism but also criticized Soros for his efforts to undermine Israel's democratically elected governments.\n\nSoros is also said to have infiltrated the National Security Council as early as May, with his operative Fiona Hill, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Soros-funded Eurasia Foundation, joining its staff. Stone reported that Soros has planted a mole in the National Security apparatus in the form of Hill, who has a Harvard background and has been on the Soros payroll and the payroll of the Open Society Institute.\n\nHill has been associated with the Soros-founded Central European University, which has attempted to influence the Hungarian government, which has resisted EU migrant quotas and Soros' meddling in its affairs. The rector of CEU, Michael Ignatieff, stated that they received support from Hill's team at the National Security Council.\n\nHowever, it remains uncertain whether these allegations are substantiated, and further investigation is required to confirm or refute these claims. The implications of these allegations, if proven true, could potentially raise concerns about the influence of foreign interests within the highest levels of the U.S. government.",
    " Title: Potential Executive Actions on Gun Control: What Obama Might Implement Without Congressional Approval\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Vice President Joe Biden's statement on Wednesday regarding potential executive actions on gun control and gun-related violence, speculation has arisen regarding the specific measures the Obama administration might take without Congressional approval.\n\nOne possible action the president could undertake is strengthening the FBI's background check database. Currently, federal agencies that do not contribute to the database, such as the Social Security Administration, possess mental competence information about potential gun buyers, or details about failed drug tests and other issues that might prevent a sale to the wrong person. The president could demand that these agencies share this information.\n\nAnother potential move is for the president to push for increased federal funding for mental-health programs. According to a Democratic aide familiar with the discussions, Obama could bypass Congress and bolster these programs.\n\nThe coalition of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, led by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has suggested several measures that could be implemented without congressional approval. These include:\n\n1. Stepping up prosecution by the Justice Department of felons and others prohibited from buying weapons when they attempt to do so.\n2. Requiring federal agencies to report records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\n3. Appointing an ATF director. The federal agency responsible for enforcing gun laws has been without a confirmed director for six years.\n\nThe New York Times reports that most changes to the current system, which allows easy access to weapons with hugely destructive power, will have to come through legislation.\n\nFollowing the Dec. 14 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Biden was tasked with presenting \"concrete proposals\" on reducing gun violence this month. Among the groups he is due to meet with today is the National Rifle Association.\n\nUpdate at 12:35 p.m. ET: Biden Sees Recommendations Coming On Universal Background Checks And High-Capacity Magazines:\n\nAt the White House a short time ago, Biden stated that there has been broad agreement among the groups he has met with so far that a system of \"universal background checks\" for gun purchasers needs to be established. Additionally, he reported broad agreement for controls on high-capacity ammunition magazines. Given past statements from NRA leaders, it is unlikely they are among those Biden is referring to when he talks of agreement on these issues.",
    " Title: Pete Buttigieg Kicks Off Presidential Campaign, Aims to Re-imagine America's Future\n\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has officially entered the race for the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2020 presidential election. At a rally in his hometown, Buttigieg outlined his vision for a \"totally different\" politics compared to President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nAt 37, Buttigieg is the youngest candidate in a crowded field of Democratic contenders, which includes Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (77) and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (69). Despite his relative inexperience, the former Rhodes Scholar has gained momentum in recent weeks, moving from the periphery to the front of the pack.\n\nIn his campaign launch, Buttigieg emphasized issues such as gun control, climate change, and LGBT rights, hoping to appeal to millennial voters. His tenure as mayor of South Bend, during which the city's economy has shown improvement, has also earned him praise.\n\nSince announcing his presidential bid in January, Buttigieg has raised over $7 million in funds in the first quarter of 2019. Analysts believe he could attract both moderates and progressives within the Democratic Party. Opinion polls in Iowa and New Hampshire last week placed Buttigieg third in both states, behind Bernie Sanders and former Vice-President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce his candidacy.\n\nAt the rally, Buttigieg sought to differentiate himself from his competitors as a candidate taking a \"long view,\" particularly on issues like climate change. \"I recognize the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor,\" he said. \"More than a little bold\u2026 But we live in a moment that compels us each to act. The forces changing our country today are tectonic.\"\n\nMore than a dozen candidates are vying for the Democratic Party's nomination. The process of selecting a nominee will begin early next year.\n\nBorn in South Bend in 1982, Buttigieg studied at Harvard and Oxford, graduating from the latter in 2007 with first-class honors in philosophy, politics, and economics. He worked as a consultant at McKinsey & Company between 2007 and 2010 and served for seven months in Afghanistan as a Navy reservist in 2014. At 29, he was elected mayor of South Bend, taking office in January 2012.\n\nDespite an unsuccessful run for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, former President Barack Obama name-checked Buttigieg as a rising star. The video announcing his presidential run focuses on his role in South Bend's redevelopment and takes aim at corruption and infighting in Washington.\n\nButtigieg came out as gay in 2015 and married Chasten Glezman, a middle school teacher, last year. In his rally speech, Buttigieg positioned himself as the voice of millennials. Critics say his campaign has so far emphasized values and his personal story rather than a distinctive policy agenda.\n\nTougher action on climate change, including the so-called \"Green New Deal\" proposals, and passing the Federal Equality Act, legislation that would give federal non-discrimination protections to LGBT people, are among Buttigieg's key policy priorities.\n\nAs the race for the Democratic Party's nomination heats up, it remains to be seen whether Buttigieg can maintain his momentum and secure the party's nomination to challenge President Trump in the November 2020 election.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking President Trump's Statements at Coronavirus Briefing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest White House briefing on the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump continued to make false and misleading claims, as the number of confirmed cases in the United States surpassed 100,000. Here is a roundup of some of the President's statements and a fact-check of their accuracy:\n\n1. The real state of the stock market 22 days ago\n\nTrump claimed that 22 days ago, \"everything was going beautifully\" before the US was hit by the coronavirus. He said, \"22 days ago we had the greatest economy in the world, everything was going beautifully, the stock market hit an all-time high.\"\n\nHowever, on March 5, 22 days before Trump's comments, the Dow dropped 3.6% or 970 points, its fifth-worst single-day point drop on record, adding to a 3,000-point drop since its peak on February 12.\n\n2. The current situation is unprecedented and unforeseen\n\nThroughout Friday's press briefing, the President claimed the current situation was unprecedented and unforeseen. He said, \"In all fairness to all of the former presidents, none of them ever thought a thing like this could happen.\"\n\nThis is false. The US intelligence community and public health experts had warned for years that the country was at risk from a pandemic. Experts had also warned that the country would face shortages of critical medical equipment, such as ventilators, if a pandemic occurred.\n\n3. General Motors should manufacture ventilators at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio\n\nAs he did on Twitter earlier on Friday, Trump suggested at the briefing that General Motors should manufacture ventilators at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio.\n\n4. The coronavirus can be called a germ, a flu, or a virus\n\nTrump said, \"You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus, you know you can call it many different names. I'm not sure anybody even knows what it is.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Thursday during an online chat with NBA star Stephen Curry that the coronavirus is \"very much more transmissible than flu and more importantly, it's significantly more serious\" -- with a mortality rate approximately 10 times higher than the 0.1% for the flu.\n\n5. Thousands of ventilators were sent to New York, and they were unaware of them\n\nTrump said, \"We sent thousands of ventilators to New York and they did not know about it at the time, they were complaining.\" Trump also said at the briefing that New York had been unaware of thousands of ventilators sitting in \"a warehouse.\"\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that New York did not know ventilators had arrived from the federal government when Gov. Andrew Cuomo was demanding additional ventilators. \"Not true,\" New York state Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Friday night. \"We knew the ventilators arrived -- and we need more ventilators.\"\n\n6. China pays 25% interest on $250 billion worth of product that they send in\n\nTrump said, \"China pays 25% interest on $250 billion worth of product that they send in.\"\n\nHowever, Trump was inaccurately describing his 25% tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese products. A tariff is not the same as \"interest.\" It is a tax paid by the importer -- the American purchaser -- not a charge paid by an entity that has borrowed money.",
    " Title: President Obama Clarifies Red Line Statement on Syria, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes Syria Use-of-Force Resolution\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Barack Obama has clarified his statement regarding the \"red line\" on the use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. During a press conference in Stockholm on Wednesday, the President stated, \"I did not set a red line, the world set a red line.\"\n\nThe President's comments come in response to his statement last year, which drew a \"red line\" on the use of chemical weapons by Assad in Syria. He further explained, \"The world set a red line when governments representing 98% of the world's population said the use of chemical weapons are abhorrent and passed a treaty forbidding their use even when countries are engaged in war.\"\n\nThe President also clarified that Congress set a red line when it ratified that treaty and indicated that some of the horrendous things happening on the ground in Syria need to be answered for. He emphasized, \"Congress set a red line when it indicated that, in a piece of legislation titled the Syria Accountability Act, some of the horrendous things that are happening on the ground there need to be answered for.\"\n\nIn an attempt to distance himself from personal leadership responsibility, the President further stated, \"My credibility is not on the line. The international community's credibility is on the line. And America and Congress's credibility is on the line because we give lip service to the notion that these international norms are important.\"\n\nIf the President's intention was to lose support for his resolution in Congress, this statement seems to have achieved that goal. As if on cue, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a Syria use-of-force resolution on Wednesday, but only by a disconcerting 10-7 vote. The President lost two Democrats and five Republicans, including Senators who are far from isolationists such as John Barrasso of Wyoming and Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\nPresident Obama's comments and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's vote highlight the ongoing debate and uncertainty surrounding U.S. involvement in Syria. The President's inability to assert clear leadership and his attempts to shift responsibility to the international community and Congress have raised questions about his approach to foreign policy and his ability to lead on the world stage.",
    " Title: California's SB 50 Fails Yet Again: Unpacking the Complex Opposition and Future Housing Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, California's contentious housing bill, SB 50, failed to pass out of the state Senate on Thursday, marking the third time the bill has fallen short in recent years. The bill, which aimed to revolutionize land use and housing in the state, faced opposition from various lawmakers, particularly those representing the Los Angeles area. Several state senators abstained from voting, reflecting the heated debates surrounding SB 50.\n\nWhile the bill's defeat is often attributed to NIMBYs (Not In My Backyard) who opposed top-down control and intrusion into their neighborhoods, the reality is more nuanced. As previously reported, a significant number of housing justice groups emerged as formidable opposition, arguing that the legislation would exacerbate displacement of low-income residents and fail to protect them adequately. Coalitions of housing justice groups and tenants' rights organizations penned letters of opposition to bill author state Sen. Scott Wiener, as well as other lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that the NIMBYs and housing justice advocates, despite sharing common ground in their opposition to SB 50, have distinct goals and motivations. NIMBYs aim to prevent major development, including low-income housing, in their neighborhoods to preserve their communities as they are. Housing justice advocates, on the other hand, are acutely aware of the displacement of low-income communities and communities of color in the face of development.\n\nThis distinction is crucial, as the two factions are often incorrectly grouped together. Some NIMBYs have even appropriated housing justice language to justify their stance, while YIMBYs (Yes In My Backyard) are quick to paint the two camps with the same brush, portraying wealthy, white homeowners as the villains.\n\nFollowing the SB 50 vote, California lawmakers have confirmed their intention to reintroduce housing production legislation. Senate President pro Tempore Toni Atkins, Sen. Wiener, and Gov. Newsom have all indicated they will be doing so imminently. As the housing crisis persists, it will remain a significant focus for legislative action over the coming year and beyond.\n\nIn response to SB 50's critics, Atkins challenged them to propose their own legislation with the same scope as SB 50. Meanwhile, the Assembly is currently considering legislation that guarantees a legal right to housing for families and children. Sen. Wiener, in a recent interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588, has already returned to the legislative drawing board, introducing two housing policy spot bills on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe failure of SB 50 underscores the complexity of the housing crisis in California and the need for nuanced, thoughtful policy solutions that address the concerns of all stakeholders, particularly those most vulnerable to displacement.",
    " Title: Silicon Valley Heavyweights Launch Political Advocacy Group FWD.us, Focus on Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at addressing the nation's immigration policy, a new political advocacy group, FWD.us, backed by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, has officially launched in San Francisco. The group, whose name stands for Forward U.S., has lined up a roster of top Silicon Valley CEOs and a team of experienced strategists.\n\nThe 11 founders of FWD.us include Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, John Doerr, a venture capitalist known for his investments in Google and Amazon.com, and Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's CEO, among others. Notable contributors include Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, and Rob Jesmer, a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nThe group's political players include Dan Senor, a Bush White House veteran and Rep. Paul Ryan's chief adviser during his vice presidential run, and Facebook executive Joel Kaplan. The team also includes Joe Lockhart, former White House press secretary for President Bill Clinton, Jef Pollock, a Democratic pollster, and Alida Garcia, former Latino vote deputy director for the Obama 2012 campaign, who will serve as the group's director of coalitions and policy.\n\nIn an op-ed in The Washington Post, Zuckerberg wrote about meeting a middle school student who is an undocumented immigrant and uncertain about his college prospects due to his immigration status. He expressed his concern about the current immigration policy, stating, \"We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants, and it's a policy unfit for today's world.\"\n\nThe group's exact actions are yet to be determined, but they are considering activities such as ads, campaign support, public communications, and grass-roots organizing. On its website, FWD.us has posted testimonials from its members.\n\nLast week, the group's co-founder and president, Joe Green, issued an apology after a leaked prospectus listed as members the names of executives who had not committed to the effort. The prospectus also raised concerns with its proposed name, \"Human Capital,\" and a statement suggesting that the group's members control \"massive distribution channels.\" Green expressed regret over some of the document's phrases.\n\nWith its official unveiling, FWD.us will focus its initial efforts on the passage of comprehensive immigration reform. Tech companies are pushing for an increase in the number of H-1B temporary visas for high-skilled foreign workers and a reduction in green card wait times for their employees.",
    " Title: Congressional Republicans Unveil $1.4 Trillion Tax-Cut Plan, Aiming for Quick Passage\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Republicans have officially unveiled their final $1.4 trillion tax-cut plan, a comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. tax code that includes significant reductions in corporate and individual tax rates, the elimination of certain credits and exemptions, and new international tax rules. The plan, which caps months of negotiations among Republicans, is expected to be voted on next week in a bid to reach President Trump's desk before Christmas.\n\nThe plan, known as the conference report, lowers the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. This reduction is being touted as the biggest corporate tax rate reduction in U.S. history. The individual tax rates remain at seven, with the top rate decreasing from 39.6 percent to 37 percent for individuals earning more than $500,000 and couples earning more than $600,000.\n\nThe new individual rates will be effective for 2018, but are set to expire after 2025, a move designed to keep the plan's overall price tag within the $1.5 trillion limit set by fast-track budget rules. Republican leaders anticipate future lawmakers will extend the cuts down the road.\n\nThe bill also doubles the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families, increasing the number of \"zero filers\" who face no federal income tax liability and the amount of income not subject to taxation for those who opt to take the standard deduction.\n\nThe plan preserves the current mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages but imposes a $750,000 cap for future mortgages. It also preserves the existing deduction for charitable contributions.\n\nThe bill repeals the Obamacare individual mandate starting in 2019, a move added during the negotiating process as lawmakers hunted for revenue sources to pay for other rate cuts. It also doubles the current exemption for the estate tax on inheritances from $5 million to $10 million, affecting fewer people.\n\nFor small businesses, there is a new 20 percent deduction that applies to the first $315,000 of joint income for so-called \"pass-through\" companies that file their taxes as individuals. For income above that level, there is a deduction for up to 20 percent on profits, reducing marginal tax rates to a maximum of 29.6 percent.\n\nBusinesses will also be able to immediately write off capital expenses for new equipment, rather than the current system that has them do it over a number of years.\n\nThe bill repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax and raises the income thresholds for the individual alternative minimum tax. The state and local tax deduction, which had been on the chopping block at the start of the process, was preserved in part, allowing people to take a deduction of up to a total of $10,000 for sales, income, and property taxes paid.\n\nThe plan also doubles the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000, and makes $1,400 of it refundable against payroll taxes. This change was sought by Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Lee, among others, to reach more families that may not make enough to pay federal income taxes.\n\nOn the international side, the bill imposes a 15.5 percent \"repatriation\" tax for cash holdings that companies have parked overseas, and an 8 percent tax for non-cash holdings.\n\nWhile Republicans are looking for swift passage next week, Democrats have criticized the package, stating that it is tilted toward corporations and the wealthy and does not do enough for the middle class. \"This tax bill is a moral and economic obscenity,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont Independent. \"It is a gift to wealthy Republican campaign contributors and an insult to the working families of our country.\"",
    " Title: Sergey Kislyak Downplays Significance of Meetings with Sessions and Trump Allies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a light-hearted interview on Russian state-owned television, former Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak jokingly stated that it would take over 20 minutes to list every discussion he had with individuals close to President Trump. The comment was made in response to a question about every person associated with Mr. Trump he had met or spoken to on the phone.\n\nDuring the interview, Kislyak, who served as Moscow's ambassador to Washington from 2008 until August 2017, appeared to scoff at the question and downplayed the total number of meetings. Kislyak, 67, is currently a member of the Russian legislature's upper chamber, representing Mordovia.\n\nKislyak's meetings with people close to Mr. Trump have been a subject of scrutiny, particularly in the U.S. Congress. On Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified before the House Judiciary Committee and admitted to meeting with Kislyak at least twice during the 2016 presidential campaign, contradicting his earlier statement made during his January confirmation hearing in the Senate.\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) questioned Sessions about the discrepancy, stating, \"Either you're lying to the U.S. Senate or you're lying to the U.S. House of Representatives.\" Sessions responded, \"My story has never changed, I have always told the truth.\"\n\nKislyak, in his interview, downplayed the significance of his meetings with Sessions and other members of the Trump administration. He stated, \"In not one meeting, not with Sessions, not with anyone else, did we use any kinds of techniques or arguments that I would not be able to speak about publicly.\"\n\nOther members of Mr. Trump's campaign, transition team, and administration have also come under scrutiny for meeting with Kislyak prior to the president's inauguration. Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, resigned in February after it emerged that he discussed lifting sanctions against Russia with Kislyak prior to Mr. Trump's inauguration and then to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of those talks. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, reportedly spoke with Kislyak during the transition period about establishing a secret back channel between the White House and Kremlin.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials have determined that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the 2016 White House race in hopes of electing Mr. Trump over his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. The alleged Russian involvement in the election and any collusion between Moscow and Mr. Trump's inner circle are currently being investigated by probes underway in the House, Senate, and Department of Justice, including a probe led by DOJ-appointed special counsel Robert Mueller that has resulted in criminal charges so far for three members of Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nRussia has denied meddling in the U.S. election, and the White House has denied colluding with the Kremlin.",
    " Title: Manchin Expresses Doubt Over Background Check Expansion Bill in Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Joe Manchin III (D-WV) has expressed doubt about the prospects of passing a bill to expand gun-purchase background checks to online and gun show sales, dealing a significant blow to gun-control advocates. The setback comes after the Connecticut shooting rampage, where proponents had hoped for more ambitious gun control measures, such as bans on certain types of weapons and magazines, and universal background checks on all gun sales.\n\nPresident Obama has been actively campaigning for the administration's package, which was crafted by Vice President Joe Biden, who has been Mr. Obama's point man on the issue. However, Sen. Manchin stated on NBC that the bill would not pass on Wednesday.\n\nAppearing on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Sen. Manchin expressed optimism, stating that if 20% of Republican senators supported the bill, it would pass. \"This thing would be home,\" he said. \"And we'll see... I'm hoping... I can't understand it. I really can't.\"\n\nJonathan Kott, a spokesman for Sen. Manchin, stated that the senator remains optimistic that if senators read the bill, they will support it. So far, Sen. Manchin has managed to garner support from an A-rated NRA member and three Republican senators, as well as 90% of his own party.\n\nSen. Manchin expressed uncertainty about the bill's passage on the Senate floor Wednesday, stating that he felt good about his efforts but was unsure about the vote count. \"I feel I'm here for this purpose,\" he said. \"Whatever happens today will happen. I feel we've done a good job, and I just ask my colleagues to consider this before we vote sometime this afternoon.\"\n\nThe prospects for the amendment have faded significantly as Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) both announced they would not support it. Both senators had voted to move debate forward on the underlying legislation last week, which includes more far-reaching background-check language, stiff penalties for gun trafficking and straw purchasing, and provisions intended to bolster school safety.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has scheduled votes on eight other amendments to the underlying gun legislation, including bans on certain types of guns and magazines. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and other co-sponsors unveiled a substitute amendment Wednesday morning intended to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and address mental health and school safety, among other provisions.\n\nSen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) also announced his own amendment intended to replace the background-check provision from Sens. Manchin and Toomey (R-PA) that would allow people to conduct self-checks through a consumer portal, among other measures. Sen. Coburn stated that the fact that it contains provisions that anger special-interest groups on both sides is a sign of its strength.",
    " Title: Gun-Rights Group Challenges Pennsylvania's Shutdown of Gun Stores Amidst Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nIn a move that could set a precedent for other states, the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) has filed a case with the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, challenging Democratic Governor Tom Wolf's order to include gun stores in the statewide shutdown of \"non-essential\" businesses due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBrandon Combs, president of the FPC, stated that the group filed the case on Friday, asking the court to block Governor Wolf from including gun stores in the shutdown. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has given Governor Wolf until 8 p.m. on Friday to respond to the arguments in the case.\n\nCombs argued, \"Weapons and ammunition retailers are one of the most essential business types in the United States. There is no \u2018 except in emergencies\u2019 clause in the Constitution and the government can not shut down the people\u2019s right to keep and bear arms.\"\n\nGovernment mandates shuttering businesses in several states, including California and Pennsylvania, have raised concerns that more gun retailers could be ordered to close. At least one gun store near San Jose has been forced to close, according to a Mercury News report.\n\nGun-rights advocates argue that Americans' access to firearms and ammunition should not be prohibited during the pandemic. \"They [retailers] are required by the government to be a point of access to the exercise of fundamental human rights,\" Combs said.\n\nAs fears of the pandemic increase and police in major cities announce they will no longer make arrests over certain crimes, Americans have flocked to gun stores and online ammunition dealers in recent weeks. A shutdown of gun stores would drastically limit their ability to purchase firearms for self-defense. It would also raise significant constitutional questions that gun-rights groups say they will challenge in court if lawmakers attempt to curb gun sales.\n\nAmy Hunter, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association (NRA), said, \"Law-abiding Americans must not be deprived of the right to defend themselves and their loved ones at any time.\" Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF), added, \"Gun prohibitionists want to close down every gun store they can and will use any means necessary. They do not believe that the means for self-defense is essential or a protected constitutional right. Our legal team is monitoring the situation very closely.\"\n\nGottlieb acknowledged that there are several challenges for Second Amendment supporters in the courts. \"Before SAF can sue, we need to wait and see how long forced closures of gun stores will last,\" he said. \"We are up against a compelling government interest in stopping a deadly virus from spreading. We also need to find the right plaintiffs to have standing and a compelling need to buy a gun and ammunition.\"\n\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun industry's trade group, is also monitoring the situation and is prepared to intervene if necessary. \"We're monitoring how our businesses are going to be affected as governors start to say we're going to shut down non-essential businesses,\" said Mark Oliva, a spokesman for the group. \"We believe our businesses are essential. We're starting to get ready to defend that if we have to.\"",
    " Title: Poll Shows Slip in Hillary Clinton's Approval Ratings Amid Email Controversy, GOP Candidates Gear Up for 2016 Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a new poll released by Quinnipiac University, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton trails former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and is only slightly ahead of Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) in the crucial state of Florida. The poll, which was conducted between March 12 and 16, shows Clinton with a 10-point lead over Rubio in February, but now trails him by a single point.\n\nThe same poll also shows Clinton ahead of the GOP field in the must-win state of Pennsylvania, but with only a 1-point lead over Senator Rand Paul (R-KY). Clinton's favorability rating in both states has dropped, with a 4-point decrease in Florida and a 6-point decrease in Pennsylvania.\n\nPeter A. Brown, the pollster for Quinnipiac University, attributed the drop in Clinton's ratings to the ongoing controversy surrounding her decision not to use a government email address while serving as Secretary of State. He stated that the issue was \"taking a toll\" on Clinton's public image.\n\nRepublicans have seized on the controversy to tarnish Clinton's image and raise doubts about her trustworthiness. On Tuesday, the GOP chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi requested an interview with Clinton to discuss her use of a private email account at the State Department and reports that she wiped her private server clean.\n\nThe request comes as Clinton is expected to announce her candidacy for the 2016 presidential race later this month. The field of GOP candidates hoping to take on Clinton is growing, with Senator Ted Cruz (TX) becoming the first Republican to formally enter the race last week, and Senator Rand Paul (KY) expected to make an announcement next week.\n\nThe deep bench of potential GOP challengers, which could also include former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, is also emboldening Republicans.\n\n\"I think people are feeling optimistic, and it's really based on our candidates and our plan and vision for the future,\" said Senator John Hoeven (R-ND). \"I think our country is really ready for a change.\"\n\nSenator John McCain (R-AZ), the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, warned his party could fumble its chance by becoming embroiled in internecine warfare or failing to reach out to Hispanic voters, an increasingly crucial bloc in presidential elections.\n\n\"We have to show we can govern,\" he said. \"There's one other issue, and that's immigration reform.\"\n\nThe email controversy has also raised questions of trustworthiness, with Ron Kaufman, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, stating that the issue \"raises questions of trustworthiness.\"\n\nDemocrats argue that Clinton maintains a sizable lead in the polls and predict GOP candidates will begin to get into their own trouble as the race gears up. Adrienne Watson, the communications director for Correct The Record, a group dedicated to defending Clinton, accused Republicans of reveling in political inanity.\n\n\"Secretary Clinton is talking about the future; about better jobs for working and middle-class Americans, Republicans are talking about a poll a year and a half before Election Day because they have no plan for America's future,\" she said.\n\n\"Manufactured scandals, politicizing an American tragedy like Benghazi and wanting into a person's personal emails will not work for the Republican politicians,\" she added.\n\nClinton has a major advantage over potential Republican opponents in that she faces a lightly contested path to the nomination. She has a huge lead over all likely Democratic candidates, according to polls.\n\n\"No amount of money or organization is going to erase Jeb Bush's family name or his brother's legacy,\" said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist. \"As much as he says he's his own man, it seems the advisers he's collecting are a redux of the Bush-Cheney administration.\"",
    " Title: Sydney Cafe Siege: Hostage Situation in Central Business District Leaves City in Lockdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, Sydney, Australia's financial and commercial heart, was plunged into a state of lockdown on Monday night following an armed hostage situation at a cafe. The siege, which lasted for several hours, ended early Tuesday morning with armed officers storming the cafe and gunshots being heard. The number of casualties and the fate of the hostage taker, identified as Man Haron Monis, an Iranian, remain unclear.\n\nThe incident began when an armed gunman took an unknown number of people hostage in a cafe in Sydney. Hundreds of police, many of them heavily armed, cordoned off the area, evacuating nearby buildings including the state parliament and the American consulate. As the day progressed, three individuals were seen escaping from the building housing the cafe, with two more following an hour later. The exact circumstances of their escape or release remain unclear. It is believed that over a dozen people may still be inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe.\n\nAustralia's Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, stopped short of labeling the hostage taking as a terrorist attack but described it as politically motivated. \"This is a very disturbing incident,\" Mr. Abbott said. \"It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation.\"\n\nAs dusk fell and commuters began leaving the central business district along gridlocked highways, police reported that they had started negotiating with the gunman. New South Wales police commissioner Andrew Scipione told reporters, \"Our plan, our only goal tonight and for as long as this takes, is to get those people that are currently caught in that building, out of there safely. That remains our number one priority and nothing will change.\"\n\nThe situation remains fluid, with little information available beyond the fact that there is at least one gunman involved. Several media outlets reported receiving phone calls from the hostages, conveying the gunman's demands, but chose not to broadcast them at the request of police. Images published by media outlets show some hostages holding against the window a black and white flag with the Shahada, a general expression of Islamic faith, printed on it.\n\nThe incident comes just three months after security agencies raised the country's terror threat level to high. In a similar incident three months ago, a man armed with a knife murdered a policeman in Melbourne in what was believed to be an Islamic State-inspired attack. Australia has since sent fighter jets to join the US-led coalition conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq, prompting calls from militants for supporters to carry out \"lone wolf\" reprisal attacks.\n\nProfessor Greg Barton of Monash University in Melbourne, who studies regional terrorist organizations, suggested that the hostage taker's use of a flag bearing the Shahada indicates a response to Islamic State's call to carry out attacks. \"The new twist is the use of hostage taking,\" says Professor Barton. \"This is a very worrying development because these things tend to get copied. The big question that hangs in the air is whether this just one sporadic lone wolf attack or is it the beginning of a cascading wave of lone wolf attacks. No one knows the answer to that.\"\n\nWorld leaders, including Stephen Harper of Canada, David Cameron of Britain, and Narendra Modi of India, have conveyed messages of support. Local Muslim leaders have also condemned the hostage taking, with Australia's Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, stating, \"The Islamic community is devastated by the incident.\"\n\nJustin Hastings, a senior lecturer in international relations at the University of Sydney, compared the Sydney siege to recent attacks in Ottawa and Montreal carried out by individuals apparently acting alone. \"They are attacks that send a very strong message that there are terrorists among us and they're very difficult to stop precisely because there is not much planning involved,\" he said.\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the radicalization of youths and the potential for homegrown attacks. More than 70 Australians are believed to be fighting for Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, and a similar number have had their passports cancelled to prevent them from traveling to conflict zones in the Middle East.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, the city remains in a state of lockdown, with the fate of those inside the cafe and the identity of the hostage taker remaining unclear.",
    " Title: Pope Francis' Unconventional Choice of Transportation: The Symbolism Behind His Black Fiat\n\nArticle:\n\nPennsylvania Avenue, the heart of the nation's capital, was abuzz with anticipation as Pope Francis prepared to address a joint meeting of Congress, marking a historic first for the pontiff. Not only is he the first pope to speak before a joint session of Congress, but he is also the first to canonize a saint on U.S. soil. However, it is not his speeches or canonizations that have captured the attention of the public, but rather his choice of transportation - a small, black Fiat.\n\nBill Newbrough, 51, and his colleagues stood on the sidewalk, discussing the car. \"This is Washington, after all, and this motorcade is slightly different from the ones we've seen before,\" he said, reminiscing about Mikhail Gorbachev's limousine in the '80s, which was so large it could only make turns along the main avenues.\n\nStephen Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies at The Catholic University of America, shared Newbrough's admiration for the car. \"It looks like a clown car when they all get in it, but it's just such a perfect metaphor for his message,\" he said.\n\nPope Francis' commitment to simplicity and humility is evident in his choice of transportation. As a Jesuit priest, he took a vow of poverty, a vow he continued to abide by even after becoming a bishop. When he became a cardinal in Argentina, he continued to use public transportation, and when he became pope, he opted for a bus over a Vatican driver. Last September, a priest from northern Italy gifted him a 1984 Renault 4, which he uses to drive himself around the Vatican.\n\nIn an interview with the Spanish daily La Vanguardia, Pope Francis spoke about his preference for a more modest vehicle. \"It's true that anything could happen, but let's face it: At my age, I don't have much to lose,\" he said.\n\nSchneck believes that the pope's choice of transportation aligns with his message of humility and a call for Catholics to focus on the marginalized. \"He's calling us as Catholics to come to the margins, to look at our lives and think about our spirituality from the perspective of those people who are most disenfranchised,\" he said.\n\nAlejandro Ca\u00f1adas, a professor of economics at Mount St. Mary's University, who has known the pope since his days in Argentina, was not surprised by his choice of transportation. \"The word 'fiat' appears in the Bible,\" he said. \"It appears in Luke 1:38 after the angel Gabriel tells Mary that she will conceive and give birth to Jesus. Mary responds, 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word.' In Latin, 'fiat' translates roughly into 'let it be done,' and for Catholics, that line has become known as Mary's fiat.\"\n\nCa\u00f1adas believes that the pope sees himself as embodying the spirit of Mary's fiat, striving to do the will of God and remaining humble and poor in service to others.\n\nBack on Pennsylvania Avenue, the pope's motorcade made its way down the street, the black Fiat nestled between black SUVs. The sun was shining, the windows were down, and Pope Francis waved from his little car. \"He was right there,\" said Paula Martin, 71, with a huge smile. \"I felt like I could almost touch him. It was an amazing experience.\"\n\nMartin, like many others, saw the pope's choice of transportation as a reflection of his humility and his commitment to connecting with people on a personal level. \"Look at the crucifix he wears,\" she said. \"It has no emeralds, no pearls. It's very simple, but that is he. Because he's a simple man.\"",
    " Title: Ocasio-Cortez Advocates for Cost-of-Living Increases for Congress Members, Cites Impact on Campaign Finance Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) defended her stance on cost-of-living increases for members of Congress, stating that voting against such increases makes campaign finance reform more difficult.\n\nOcasio-Cortez argued that voting against cost-of-living increases can create pressure on lawmakers to keep \"dark money\" loopholes open. She explained that this position is not popular but emphasized the importance of consistency in policy-making.\n\n\"Voting against cost of living increases is one reason why dark $ loopholes stay open,\" she tweeted. \"ALL workers should get cost of living increases. That\u2019s why minimum wage should be pegged to inflation, too.\"\n\nThe self-proclaimed democratic socialist also suggested worker cooperatives and collective bargaining as forums where worker pay increases can be voted on.\n\nThe House Democrats pulled a spending bill that would have given raises to members of Congress for the first time in a decade on Monday, following pushback from swing state lawmakers. Ocasio-Cortez has been vocal on living wage issues and campaign finance reform.",
    " Title: Business Executives Puzder and Tillerson: A New Approach to Government for the Trump Administration\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing selection process of Donald Trump's Cabinet, two types of businesspeople have sparked debate among Democrats: those who embody traditional business practices and those who do not. This dichotomy is evident in the cases of Andrew Puzder and Rex Tillerson, both of whom have faced skepticism from the opposition party.\n\nAndrew Puzder, nominated to head the Department of Labor, is the CEO of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Hardee's and Carl's Jr. fast-food chains. In his role, he has gained insights into labor issues, the focus of the department's activities.\n\nPuzder's stance on minimum wage, a contentious topic, has been a point of contention. Last year, he wrote, \"Instead of creating a living wage, the fight for dramatic minimum-wage increases could leave millions with no wage at all.\" This perspective, while not aligning with some progressive ideals, is in line with standard economic theory, as noted by Nobel laureate Paul Krugman in 1998.\n\nPuzder's career has created jobs; CKE and its franchisees employ approximately 90,000 people. He is vocal about his opposition to government mandates that increase his outlets' costs and reduce their profitability. He advocates for the benefits of automation, stating that machines never show up late or file lawsuits.\n\nRex Tillerson, chosen for the position of secretary of state, is not a stereotypical Texas oilman. As president of the Boy Scouts of America, he advocated for the inclusion of gay troop leaders. Exxon Mobil, his former company, has donated to Planned Parenthood. Tillerson's stance on climate change, particularly his support for a carbon tax, has been a point of contention among conservatives.\n\nCritics fear that Tillerson will prioritize the interests of the oil industry over those of the American public. However, CEOs, like Tillerson, are not free agents. They are accustomed to serving the interests of shareholders while catering to customers. As head of Exxon Mobil, Tillerson profited from high oil prices, but had he worked for Ford, he would have developed a preference for cheap fuel.\n\nBoth Puzder and Tillerson offer relevant experience and seasoned judgment, which may be in short supply in the Trump administration. Their business backgrounds provide a unique perspective, and they are not hostile to compromise. Puzder has expressed support for a higher minimum wage, and Tillerson has advocated for a carbon tax.\n\nThese business executives, if confirmed, could potentially mitigate some of Trump's more controversial impulses. During the presidential campaign, Puzder argued for a path to legal status for illegal immigrants, while Tillerson's diplomatic experience, albeit limited, could prove valuable in foreign policy matters.\n\nIn conclusion, the nominations of Andrew Puzder and Rex Tillerson offer a new approach to government, bringing business acumen and practical experience to the Trump administration. Senate Democrats should move swiftly to approve these nominations before any potential changes in Trump's cabinet selections.",
    " Title: House Democrats Block 17th Attempt to Advance Born-Alive Protection Act\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - A contentious debate over the Born-Alive Protection Act has been ongoing in the House of Representatives, with Republican lawmakers expressing frustration over repeated attempts to bring the bill to the floor for a vote. The legislation aims to protect babies born alive after an attempted abortion.\n\nLast night, for the 17th time, the House was asked to consider the bill, but Democrats once again refused to allow a debate and vote on the matter.\n\n\"For the 17th time, the Democrats refused,\" said US Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).\n\nThe bill's proponents argue that there are instances where babies are born alive after an attempted abortion, only to be ultimately terminated.\n\n\"There are babies being born alive and then ultimately murdered,\" explained US Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA).\n\nChris Smith (R-NJ), the House pro-life caucus leader, described a particularly harrowing incident in a Florida abortion clinic.\n\n\"The clinic owner took the baby who was gasping for air, cut her umbilical cord, threw her into a biohazard bag and put the bag in the trash. Like so much garbage,\" he said.\n\nThe inability to end this practice and even bring it to a vote has sparked outrage among pro-life lawmakers.\n\n\"This is the height of shamefulness. It is absolutely an abomination that this is going on and we're having to have this argument in the United States today,\" said US Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY).\n\nDemocrats, who are currently in control of the House, have prevented the Born-Alive Protection Act from coming to the House floor for debate and a vote.\n\nMeanwhile, in some states, lawmakers are pushing for radical abortion legislation to keep such practices legal. States like New York, Rhode Island, and others are introducing bills that could potentially make their states abortion havens. Illinois is also considering the Reproductive Health Act, which, according to one abortion group, could cement Illinois as the Midwest abortion oasis.\n\nPro-life activists like Melissa Cifuentes are fighting similar laws in Rhode Island.\n\n\"We are called to use our voice to speak the truth on behalf of innocent lives that are sacred and that are worthy of our protection,\" Cifuentes noted. \"And I can't help but ask and wonder if future generations will ask how 21st-century Americans didn't see the harms in what they were doing?\"\n\nJill Stanek, national campaign chair of the Susan B. Anthony List, has been advocating for the Born-Alive Protection Act.\n\n\"Halt this bloodlust and work to protect unborn and born babies rather than provide a killing oasis,\" Stanek said.\n\nThese lawmakers are urging Americans to contact their representatives in Congress to sign the discharge petition for the Born-Alive Protection Act. If that gets 218 signatures, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has to let the bill come to the floor for a vote.",
    " Title: Trump's Remarks on Paris and London Attacks Spark Controversy, Draw Criticism from French and British Officials\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech at the National Rifle Association (NRA) convention, U.S. President Donald Trump criticized strict gun laws in two of America's closest allies, France and the United Kingdom, citing the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris and an increase in knife violence in London.\n\nFrance was particularly incensed by Trump's comments, with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian issuing a statement on Saturday, expressing \"firm disapproval\" of Trump's remarks and calling for the respect of the memory of the victims. Former French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande also tweeted his disapproval, stating that Trump's remarks \"say a lot about what he thinks of France and its values.\"\n\nTrump suggested that if Parisians in the cafes under attack had been armed, the outcome might have been different. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace responded by stating that \"the free flow of arms within society does not constitute a shield against terrorist attacks.\"\n\nIn the case of London, Trump compared an unnamed hospital to a \"war zone\" due to the high number of knife attacks. British officialdom did not push back, with London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office declining to comment to CNN following Trump's remarks. However, former UK Cabinet minister Charlie Falconer tweeted his disapproval, stating that the U.S. murder rate is over five times higher than the UK's and that making it easier to obtain guns would not reduce the murder rate.\n\nAmid the furor over Trump's comments, trauma surgeons at the hospitals in question have hit back. Dr. Martin Griffiths, a trauma surgeon at the Royal London Hospital, recently told the BBC that his fellow doctors have compared the hospital to an Afghan war zone. In response to Trump's comments, Griffiths tweeted an invitation for Trump to visit the hospital to discuss violence reduction in London.\n\nProfessor Karim Brohi, a trauma surgeon at The Royal London Hospital and director of London's Major Trauma System, also criticized Trump's speech, stating that the Royal London Hospital has cut the number of young patients returning after further knife attacks from 45% to 1%. Brohi added that while there is more that can be done to combat knife attacks, gunshot wounds are \"at least twice as lethal as knife injuries and more difficult to repair.\"\n\nTrump and British Prime Minister Theresa May spoke by phone on Saturday, discussing China trade, North Korea, Iran, and Trump's upcoming visit to Britain. It is unknown whether they discussed Trump's remarks to the NRA.",
    " Title: Grassroots Conservatives Call for Change as GOP Establishment Breaks Promises on Omnibus Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a scathing critique, grassroots conservatives are calling for change within the Republican Party, accusing the GOP establishment in Congress of breaking promises made during elections and betraying the conservative movement. The criticism stems from the recent passing of the omnibus spending bill, which has been criticized for funding policies that go against conservative values.\n\nThe article, written by a conservative commentator, likens the relationship between grassroots conservatives and the GOP establishment to that of a battered spouse, with the GOP repeatedly making promises and then failing to deliver. The author accuses the GOP of funding policies that are anathema to conservative values, such as funding for Planned Parenthood, visas for un-vetted Muslim migrants, and H-2B visas for foreign workers, while neglecting to fund border security measures.\n\nThe author also criticizes the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative representatives, for their perceived inaction in the face of the GOP establishment's betrayal. The author accuses the caucus of failing to hold the GOP accountable and of being complicit in the betrayal of conservative values.\n\nThe author argues that the GOP establishment does not care about winning national elections and is content with maintaining the status quo, even if it means a Democrat in the White House. The author suggests that the GOP establishment prefers a Democrat president as a foil, allowing them to avoid taking leadership roles and to continue enjoying the perks of office.\n\nHowever, the author also acknowledges that not all Republicans are content with the status quo, and that the Tea Party movement has brought more conservative representatives to Congress. The author calls for grassroots conservatives to stay engaged with the Republican Party and to work towards ousting the GOP establishment from power.\n\nThe article concludes with a call to action, urging grassroots conservatives to hold the GOP accountable and to demand that they uphold the values they campaigned on. The author argues that it is time for a change within the Republican Party and that grassroots conservatives have the power to bring about that change.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Grows at 2.6% in Q4, Suggesting Sustained Growth Amid Fed's Patient Approach to Interest Rates\n\nThe U.S. economy expanded at a 2.6% annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to a report released Thursday by the Commerce Department. This growth rate is slightly below the 2.2% median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, but it follows a 3.4% advance in the previous three months.\n\nThe report shows that consumption, which accounts for the majority of the economy, grew 2.8%, slightly below forecasts. Nonresidential business investment accelerated to a 6.2% gain on equipment, software, and research spending. Government spending slowed, trade was a minor drag, and inventories gave GDP a small boost.\n\nThe report suggests that the Republican-backed tax cuts may have continued to aid growth, helping bring the full-year figure to 3.1%, just above President Donald Trump's 3% goal. While the expansion is poised to become the nation's longest on record at midyear, the pace could cool amid the trade war, slowing global growth, and fading impact of fiscal stimulus.\n\nA separate report Thursday from the Labor Department showed filings for unemployment benefits rose by more than expected last week to 225,000, still near a five-decade low. The week included the Presidents Day holiday, and claims tend to be more volatile around such events.\n\nGrowth, while slower than the prior two quarters, remains above both the average pace of the expansion and what the Fed sees as the economy's long-run potential of 1.9%. Still, surveys and gauges such as Treasury yields indicate chances of a recession have increased in recent months while remaining unlikely for 2019.\n\nExcluding the volatile trade and inventories components of GDP, final sales to domestic purchasers increased at a 2.6% pace following 2.9%. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand.\n\nThe increase in consumer spending followed the third quarter's 3.5% gain. It contributed 1.92 percentage points to growth. Drivers included health care, financial services and insurance, and other nondurable goods and services, while spending on food services and accommodations fell.\n\nThe GDP data may reinforce analyst criticism of the government's recent report on December retail sales. That showed the biggest drop in nine years, even as other figures -- particularly reports from the country\u2019s largest retailers -- indicated consumers continued to open their wallets in the quarter.\n\nThursday's report showed the third-quarter slowdown in business spending may have been temporary. Nonresidential fixed investment contributed 0.82 percentage point to growth following 0.35 point in the third quarter.\n\nWithin that category, spending on structures fell 4.2%, the biggest drop in a year, a slowdown that may partly reflect falling oil prices. Business-equipment investment rose 6.7% and intellectual property spending jumped 13.1%.\n\nHousing remained a weak spot last quarter, posting the fourth consecutive drag on GDP growth, with a contraction of 3.5%. Home sales tumbled in late 2018 amid elevated mortgage rates and price increases that continued to outpace wages, though there are signs of demand picking up in early 2019 thanks to a drop in borrowing costs.\n\nNet exports subtracted 0.22 percentage point from GDP growth during the quarter following a 1.99-point reduction in the prior period. The drag reflected a 2.7% rise in imports that outpaced a 1.6% increase in exports, with the tariff war buffeting both sets of flows.\n\nInventories added 0.13 percentage point to the pace of expansion. Meanwhile, inflation remained muted, adding little urgency for the Fed to consider resuming interest-rate hikes. The GDP report showed the Fed's preferred price index rose at a 1.5% annualized pace last quarter, below the central bank's 2% goal. Excluding food and energy, the index rose 1.7%.",
    " Title: Trump Signs $1.3 Trillion Spending Bill, Averts Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump signed the recently passed $1.3 trillion spending bill on Friday, ending a brief period of uncertainty sparked by a tweeted veto threat that hinted at a potential government shutdown.\n\nTrump, despite his reservations on certain aspects of the bill, signed it due to a $60 billion increase in military spending, which he deemed a significant compromise.\n\n\"I have signed the bill, but I say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again,\" Trump told reporters. \"I'm not going to do it again.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, White House and Capitol Hill aides were left in a state of flux following Trump's criticism of the six-month spending bill, despite previous assurances from the administration that he would sign it before the midnight deadline.\n\n\"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded,\" Trump wrote on Twitter at 9 a.m. EDT.\n\nTrump then convened with his senior advisers to discuss a potential veto, only to be advised against it, with the advisers stating he would be held responsible for a shutdown and that discussions on the issues he is concerned about were ongoing, one aide said.\n\nBy early afternoon, he appeared before reporters in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House to announce he had signed the measure.\n\n\"There are a lot of things I'm unhappy about in this bill,\" he said, gesturing to the more than 2,000 pages of the legislation stacked on a purple box beside him.\n\nIt remained unclear how seriously Republican leaders took Trump's shutdown threat. Neither Speaker Paul Ryan nor Senate Leader Mitch McConnell made public comments on the matter.\n\nLawmakers in the Republican-controlled Senate and House of Representatives had already departed Washington for a scheduled two-week spring recess, and Trump himself was scheduled to travel to his private resort in Florida on Friday.\n\nTrump has expressed dissatisfaction over Congress's failure to provide funding for his campaign promise to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill includes $1.6 billion for six months' worth of work on the project, but he had sought $25 billion for it.\n\nTrump has also been at odds with Democrats in Congress over the fate of Dreamer immigrants - those brought to the United States illegally as children. Trump terminated the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which grants work permits to Dreamers and shields them from deportation. The decision is currently under court review.\n\nTrump offered to extend the protections, tied to a sweeping set of immigration law changes, but subsequently rejected bipartisan offers from lawmakers as the six-month spending budget deal was being finalized.",
    " Title: Sen. Cory Booker Proposes Universal Child Savings Accounts to Combat Economic Inequality\n\nIn a bid to address rising economic inequality in the United States, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has introduced a bill that aims to provide every U.S. child with an interest-bearing savings account at birth. The bill, which was unveiled on Monday, seeks to establish a federal program that would create and administer these accounts, with the initial principal balance of $1,000 granted by the government.\n\nThe accounts, to be managed by the Treasury Department, would receive additional deposits of up to $2,000 per year until the recipient turns 18, depending on the family's total income. The accounts would be federally insured, and the funds could only be used for homeownership and \"human and financial capital investments that change life trajectories,\" according to a summary of the bill.\n\nSen. Booker, who is often mentioned as a potential 2020 presidential candidate, stated, \"Everyone in America should have a real shot to succeed, but federal policy over decades and an upside-down tax code that heaps benefits on the very rich and big corporations have grown the gap between those who have much and those who have little.\"\n\nThe program, estimated to cost approximately $60 billion if implemented in 2019, would be funded by increasing the capital gains tax rate by 4.2 points, raising the estate tax to its 2009 level, and imposing taxes on multimillion-dollar inheritances.\n\nEconomic inequality, as measured by the wealth gap between the richest and poorest Americans, has been on the rise since the 2007-08 financial crisis. While the wealthy have benefited from low interest rates and loose financial conditions during the recession, the resulting spike in equity and property values has left much of the working class behind.\n\nThere is also a significant racial wealth gap due to decades of discriminatory laws and business practices that have prevented minorities from accessing the same financial products and investments as whites. The median net worth of whites is roughly 10 times larger than that of blacks, and nearly 1 in 5 black families have zero or negative net worth, according to Federal Reserve data from 2017.\n\nSen. Booker's bill is the latest comprehensive policy proposal from a potential 2020 Democratic primary candidate aimed at bolstering the economic stability of working- and middle-class Americans. Several of Sen. Booker's potential primary rivals, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.), have introduced bills to increase the supply of affordable housing and boost low-income household wealth.\n\nA similar federally funded savings program was instituted in Israel last year.",
    " Title: Turkey Launches Military Offensive in Northern Syria, Amidst US Troop Withdrawal and International Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Turkey launched a full-scale military offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria on Wednesday, just days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of American troops from the region. The operation, dubbed \"Operation Peace Spring,\" was met with airstrikes, artillery, and ground offensives, marking the culmination of long-building tensions.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the operation as a push against terrorists, aiming to \"destroy the terror corridor which is trying to be established on our southern border and to bring peace... to the region.\" He also emphasized that Turkey's objective is to preserve Syria's territorial integrity and liberate local communities from terrorists.\n\nAlthough the U.S. administration agreed to remove its troops, which had been working alongside local Kurds in the fight against ISIS, Trump stated on Wednesday that the White House \"made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea.\" He added that Turkey \"has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place.\"\n\nTrump defended his decision to withdraw troops, stating that the U.S. has spent \"EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS fighting and policing in the Middle East\" and that the focus is now on \"the BIG PICTURE!\"\n\nTurkey views the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in Syria as terrorists due to their ties to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey. Heavy shelling targeted border towns, causing civilians to flee for safer ground, and Turkish jets reportedly pulverized suspected hiding spots of Syrian Kurdish forces in the town of Ras al-Ayn.\n\nAt least seven civilians and one member of Kurdish-led forces were killed in the first day of fighting, according to Kurdish activists and a Syrian war monitor. The airstrikes were not coordinated with the U.S. military, according to a U.S. official speaking anonymously.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council is set to meet behind closed doors on Thursday to discuss the conflict, with the five European members of the 15-member council\u2014Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and Poland\u2014requesting the sit-down, according to diplomats.\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal and the ensuing conflict have been criticized in Washington, including by Republicans, as a betrayal of the U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters who have been instrumental in the fight against ISIS. Sen. Lindsey Graham, typically a reliable Trump backer, lamented, \"Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration.\"\n\nDespite the reservations, Trump insisted in his comments Wednesday that he wants to end \"forever wars\" claiming American lives. He also stated that the Kurds, while traditional allies of the Americans, haven't always been there, citing their lack of involvement in World War II and the D-Day landings. \"With all of that being said, we like the Kurds,\" he added.",
    " Title: DeVos Administration Overturns Obama-Era Guidelines on Handling University Sex Assault Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift, the Trump administration has overturned rules introduced during the Obama administration for handling university sexual assault allegations. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stated that the previous administration's guidance was unfairly tilted against the accused.\n\nMrs. DeVos emphasized that campuses would continue to confront such \"horrific crimes,\" but she added that the process must be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes. The new interim instructions allow universities to decide the standard of evidence to be used when handling complaints.\n\nThe DeVos guidelines introduce the higher standard of proof, requiring \"clear and convincing evidence\" in campus sexual assault cases. Under President Obama, universities were able to judge students based on a preponderance of evidence, instead of guilt being proved beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases.\n\nThe Obama administration's 2011 and 2014 college sexual misconduct policies also required colleges to investigate complaints even if there was a separate criminal inquiry. Critics of that approach said it protected survivors at the expense of the accused's rights.\n\nThe Obama administration took action after dozens of women said their sex assault cases had been mishandled. In one high-profile 2016 case at Stanford University in California, an athlete's six-month sentence, after he was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious student, was condemned as outrageously lenient.\n\nHowever, Mrs. DeVos, earlier this month, stated, \"Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today.\"\n\nAdvocates for sexual assault victims warned that Friday's policy reversal would deter victims from stepping forward. Kim Churches, chief executive officer of the American Association of University Women, said, \"This is a blatant rollback from the strong and much-needed guidance that was in place.\"\n\nHouse of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi denounced the change as a \"shocking attack\" on women. In July, Mrs. DeVos's top civil rights deputy, Candice Jackson, provoked fury when she told a reporter that 90% of campus rape investigations \"fall into the category of 'we were both drunk.'\"\n\nShe said the majority of such cases amounted to \" 'we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.' \" Ms. Jackson apologized, and a Democratic senator, Patty Murray of Washington state, called in vain for her to be fired.\n\nEarlier this month, the Education Department said 360 sexual violence cases were under investigation at 250 colleges and universities across the US.",
    " Title: Vaping Flavor Ban: A Case of Hasty Policies and Unclear Causes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding the health implications of vaping, a recent trend has emerged: the banning of flavored vaping products. This move, primarily driven by concerns over a lung-related illness outbreak, has sparked controversy and raised questions about the effectiveness and necessity of such measures.\n\nWhile cities, such as those in the San Francisco Bay Area, have passed laws banning flavored nicotine products, states like Michigan and New York have taken a step further by enacting temporary bans on flavored vaping products. The Trump administration has also used the Food and Drug Administration to potentially ban flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nHowever, the cause of the illness outbreak remains unclear, with no evidence linking it to the flavoring in these products. As reported by National Public Radio, \"The role of flavored vape products in the current outbreak is unknown at this time.\"\n\nThis sudden push for flavored vape product bans has raised concerns about a potential overreaction to the current crisis. Critics argue that this is a case of those opposed to vaping in general using the outbreak as a means to create a banning frenzy, similar to the way anti-gun legislators use gun-related violence to promote restrictive policies.\n\nIn contrast, California has taken a more restrained approach, shelving a bill that would have banned flavored tobacco products and instead focusing on tightening enforcement of e-cigarette sales to teens and launching a public awareness campaign about the health risks of vaping.\n\nThe Washington Post has also taken a more nuanced view, suggesting that the illnesses may be linked to marijuana-based vape products, not flavored nicotine-based ones. The Post's Paige Winfield Cunningham wrote that \"marijuana is likely to blame.\"\n\nWhile the health risks of vaping are undeniable, it's important to consider the potential consequences of banning flavored vaping products. Banning flavored tobacco amounts to a virtual ban on vaping, as virtually all vaping liquids are flavored. Cities and states don't ban flavored alcohol sales because underage drinkers might prefer cinnamon-flavored liqueurs or fruity wines. They don't ban all legal alcohol sales if a bad batch of underground hooch kills or sickens people.\n\nMoreover, smoking combustible cigarettes is a dangerous habit, one likely to shave 10 years off of a smoker's life and lead to costly and debilitating health problems. Vaping is one of the most effective ways to help adult smokers break their deadly habit. In 2016, the Royal College of Physicians in Great Britain reported that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than smoking.\n\nIn conclusion, while the health risks of vaping are undeniable, the current crisis seems to be a complex issue that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach. Banning flavored vaping products may not be the best solution, especially when the cause of the illness outbreak remains unclear. Enforcing current laws and educating children about the dangers of vaping, as well as other substances, may be a more effective and sensible approach.",
    " Title: The Impact of Matal v. Tam on Trademark Law and Racial Stereotypes in Branding\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark decision three years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in Matal v. Tam that it was unconstitutional for the law to ban trademarks deemed disparaging. This ruling, initially celebrated by the Asian rock band The Slants, has since had far-reaching implications, particularly in the realm of racial stereotypes in branding.\n\nWhile The Slants' lead singer, Simon Tam, expressed optimism for free speech, his interpretation of the victory's significance was misplaced. The court's decision in Matal v. Tam effectively ended the decades-long legal challenge to the Washington Redskins trademark, a case initially spearheaded by the Cheyenne and Muscogee Creek activist and scholar Suzan Shown Harjo and later led by a team of Native American plaintiffs, including Amanda Blackhorse. The same day as the court's ruling on the Tam case, Washington football team owner Dan Snyder issued a statement expressing his delight, further indicating the potential impact of the decision.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter movement, several brands are reassessing the harmful stereotypes they have perpetuated. In the last few days, Quaker Oats, the owner of the 131-year-old Aunt Jemima brand, announced changes to the product name in pursuit of \"progress toward racial equality.\" The brand had long capitalized on a romanticized view of antebellum American slavery, even going as far as to hire a former slave to impersonate the character of Aunt Jemima at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair.\n\nFollowing Quaker's announcement, the Mars corporation announced similar changes to its Uncle Ben's rice products. Even Mrs. Butterworth's pancake syrup, with its bottle embodying a racist caricature of a black woman, is undergoing a \"complete brand and package review.\"\n\nThe events of the past few days underscore the enduring impact of the Matal v. Tam decision and the growing recognition of the need for racial sensitivity in branding. The cases of Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben, and Mrs. Butterworth serve as stark reminders of the harmful stereotypes that have been perpetuated in the past and the importance of addressing them in the present.",
    " Title: Six Cities in the Running for the 2016 Democratic National Convention\n\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) has announced the six cities that have submitted bids to host the 2016 Democratic National Convention. The cities are Birmingham, Alabama; Cleveland, Columbus, Ohio; New York, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nIn a press release, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz expressed enthusiasm about the options available for the upcoming event. \"We're thrilled with all the fantastic options that we have going into the next cycle,\" she said. \"We look forward to evaluating these bids and selecting a city to host this special gathering of Democrats.\"\n\nThe technical advisory committee will assess the cities over the coming months, with site visits and other inquiries. The DNC plans to announce its decision later this year or in early 2015.\n\nThe Republican National Committee (RNC) is further along in its selection process. Denver, Dallas, Cleveland, and Kansas City are the final cities bidding to host the 2016 Republican National Convention. The RNC expects to announce its final decision in the fall.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has pitched Brooklyn as the focal point for the Big Apple's bid to host the 2016 Democratic convention. The Barclays Center, home to the NBA's Brooklyn Nets, is intended to serve as the principal venue site for the convention, with other events and accommodations spread across Brooklyn, Manhattan, and New York's other boroughs.\n\nNew York City last hosted a party's presidential nominating convention in 2004, when the Republican National Convention was held in Manhattan's Madison Square Garden. The Democratic convention was held in the same venue in 1992. Among the other final five choices for the Democrats, Philadelphia is the only one to previously host a major party convention. In 2000, Republicans officially nominated George W. Bush as the party's standard bearer at the then-named First Union Center.\n\nThe DNC sent official requests for proposals to 15 cities in April, including Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus (Ohio), Detroit, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, and Salt Lake City. The city chosen will host a significant political event in the 2016 campaign season.",
    " Title: \"HyperGiant's ACES Tool: A Comprehensive Simulator for Assessing Climate Impact and Solutions Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unprecedented effort to bridge the understanding gap between two global crises, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) and climate change, artificial intelligence start-up HyperGiant has developed a free, interactive tool called \"ACES: A Post Covid Emissions Simulator.\" This innovative tool allows users to visualize and calculate the carbon dioxide emissions reductions that could result from pandemic-induced behaviors, such as increased remote work and reduced air travel, and compare them to the emissions targets set by the Paris Climate Accord.\n\nThe ACES tool enables users to adjust variables like the percentage of the workforce working from home, the reduced amount of air travel, and the decrease in meat consumption to determine the carbon dioxide emissions savings if these changes were to become permanent. For instance, if 30% of the workforce works from home, air travel is reduced by 50%, and people eat 15% less meat, the tool estimates that 18 billion tons of carbon dioxide would be eliminated, which is approximately 38% of the way towards the Paris Agreement's emissions reduction targets for the United States.\n\nThe tool also allows users to explore the potential impact of implementing new technologies, such as carbon capture, renewable power generation, and advanced land management and agriculture strategies, to achieve carbon neutrality (a state where the net total carbon emissions equal zero, either through reducing emissions to zero or supporting enough carbon offset programs to compensate for emissions). For example, if 30% of the workforce works from home, air travel is reduced by 50%, and people eat 15% less meat, and then the option of making all vehicles in the U.S. electric is added, the tool estimates that 33 billion tons of carbon dioxide would be eliminated by 2050.\n\nHyperGiant climate advisor Noam Bar-Zemer explains, \"One of the most difficult things about understanding climate change is understanding the size of the actual climate problem relative to the size of the potential solutions. If I tell you that we will not emit billions of tons of CO2 as a result of Covid-19, that sounds like a lot unless you know how to compare it to the size of the greenhouse gas crisis. This tool makes it easier for people to compare and understand the impact of proposed solutions.\"\n\nBased in Austin, Texas, HyperGiant was founded in 2018 and has over 230 employees. The company, which specializes in problem-solving and boosting efficiency via artificial intelligence solutions, generates \"mid-eight figures\" in revenue, according to CEO Ben Lamm. The ACES tool is a testament to HyperGiant's commitment to using AI to address pressing global challenges and foster a more sustainable future.",
    " Title: President Obama Addresses George Zimmerman Verdict, Discusses African-American Community's Perspective and Social Issues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rare appearance in the White House press room last Friday, President Barack Obama commented on the George Zimmerman verdict, expressing empathy with the African-American community's perspective on the case. The president stated, \"I can understand why the African-American community is so sensitive to this issue. I can identify with Trayvon Martin because of a history that stretches back two centuries.\"\n\nThe president spoke about the historical context that shapes the way many black people view such cases, referencing instances of racial profiling and discrimination. He acknowledged the disproportionate representation of African-Americans in the criminal justice system, both as victims and perpetrators of violence.\n\nHowever, the president also emphasized that this is not an excuse for such behavior. He stated, \"We understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country, and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history.\"\n\nThe president's comments sparked a broader discussion about the complexities of race and poverty in the United States. Critics argue that much poverty in the African-American community stems from broken or never-started families, high rates of single-parent households, and a lack of employment opportunities due to negative stereotypes perpetuated by the media and society.\n\nThe president's comments on the Zimmerman case have been criticized for not addressing the broader issues of poverty, family structure, and education in African-American communities. Some argue that the president's focus on race ignores the fact that there are many poor people in the same neighborhoods who do not engage in violent behavior.\n\nThe politics of race also play a role in the way these issues are perceived and addressed. When black people kill each other or murder a white person, the president usually does not comment, with the recent murder of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton being a rare exception.\n\nThe president's comments have sparked a debate about the role of race in American society and the need for a broader conversation about race and its impact on communities of color. Some argue that discussions about race should include a critique of attitudes and behavior that contribute to racial conflict, such as the portrayal of gangsta culture in the media and the high abortion rate among black women.\n\nIn a comment on the Washington Post's website, a reader named \"Chaquita1\" shared a personal story about witnessing an African-American woman confronting two young African-American males in \"gangsta wear\" on a train. The woman reportedly told the young men, \"Trayvon Martin died for nothing. His death did not empower you, it should have been a wake-up call.\"\n\nAs the nation grapples with issues of race and poverty, the president's comments have sparked a broader conversation about the need for a nuanced and comprehensive approach to addressing these complex issues.",
    " Title: Saturday Night Live Drops Comedian Shane Gillis After Offensive Remarks Surface\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a swift turn of events, US comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live (SNL) has parted ways with new cast member Shane Gillis following the resurfacing of videos showing him making derogatory remarks about Chinese people.\n\nGillis, 31, found himself in hot water shortly after his casting was announced when footage from a podcast featuring the comic emerged. Following discussions with Gillis, an SNL spokesperson announced that he would not be joining the NBC show.\n\nGillis took to Twitter to express his respect for SNL's decision, stating, \"Of course I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at SNL, but I understand it would be too much of a distraction.\"\n\nThe SNL spokesperson explained in a Monday statement that the decision to terminate Gillis was made after a discussion with the comic. \"We want SNL to have a variety of voices and points of view within the show, and we hired Shane on the strength of his talent as a comedian and his impressive audition for SNL,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, the spokesperson added, \"We were not aware of his prior remarks that have surfaced over the past few days. The language he used is offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable.\"\n\nGillis' casting was announced just hours before SNL's 45th season, but a September 2018 podcast resurfaced in which Mr. Gillis mocked Chinese people and described his remarks as \"nice racism.\" In another episode from the same month, Mr. Gillis used homophobic slurs to describe Hollywood producer Judd Apatow and comedian Chris Gethard.\n\nGillis defended the comments on Twitter, stating, \"I am a comedian 'who pushes boundaries.' My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be, and sometimes that requires risks.\"\n\nGood Good Comedy Theatre in Philadelphia, Gillis' hometown, also distanced itself from the comic, stating on Twitter that they had \"deliberately chosen not to work with him because of his 'overt racism, sexism, homophobia - expressed both on and off stage.'\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding Gillis' hiring has sparked debate among fellow comedians and media personalities. Comedian Rob Schneider, a former SNL cast member, tweeted his support for Gillis, stating, \"I am sorry that you had the misfortune of being a cast member during this era of cultural unforgiveness where comedic misfires are subject to the intolerable inquisition of those who never risked bombing on stage themselves.\"\n\nFellow comics Bill Burr and Jim Jeffries also criticized SNL's decision while appearing on the US series Lights Out with David Spade. Jeffries said the move was a symptom of \"cancel culture,\" while Burr added, \"You could do that to anybody. I don't get it. Millennials - you're a bunch of rats. None of them care; all they want to do is get people in trouble.\"\n\nTaiwanese-American presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who Gillis referred to using a slur in a podcast, has said the comedian \"deserved another chance to keep his job\" but society has become \"unduly punitive and vindictive.\" Yang and Gillis are expected to discuss the matter soon.\n\nIn addition to Gillis, SNL had announced the hiring of two other new cast members: Chloe Fineman and Bowen Yang. Yang will be the show's first full-time Chinese-American cast member.",
    " Title: Senate Fails to Pass Bills on Late-Term Abortion and Infant Care, Dividing Lawmakers Along Party Lines\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly contentious session on Tuesday, the U.S. Senate failed to pass two bills aimed at regulating late-term abortions and the care of infants born alive after botched procedures. The votes, which were largely along party lines, have sparked heated debates and revealed deep divisions within the Senate, particularly on the issue of abortion rights.\n\nThe first bill, sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), sought to impose criminal penalties, including fines and up to five years in prison, for medical providers who perform abortions after a fetus reaches five months of gestation. The bill, which has been a long-standing initiative for Sen. Graham, includes exceptions for cases of pregnancy complications that threaten the life of the pregnant person, or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.\n\nThe Senate voted 53-44 to advance the 20-week ban, but fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage. Senators Joe Manchin III (D-WV) and Bob Casey (D-PA) joined Republicans in support of the bill, while Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) bucked their party and voted with Democrats to block the bill.\n\nThe second bill, introduced by Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE), required health care workers to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a botched abortion, ensuring the child is admitted to a hospital. Failure to act would have resulted in fines or prison time. This bill was blocked 56-41.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) described the two bills as an opportunity for senators to take a \"clear moral stand.\" He suggested that the GOP leader wanted to put Democrats on record for abortion restrictions he called \"morally straightforward.\"\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-FL) accused Democrats of supporting \"infanticide,\" while Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) characterized the measures as an attempt to energize the Republican's far-right base.\n\nCritics of the bills argue they are unnecessary and aim to further limit a woman's control over her body. They contend that state laws already ban murder, making additional legislation redundant. Proponents of the measures argue that the bills are humane and based on science.\n\nThe votes have put senators on record about late-term abortions. Only seven countries permit abortions beyond 20 weeks. The Democratic Party has moved toward expanding abortion rights, including for the first time in 2016 making overturning the ban on federally funding for abortions part of the party platform. However, the issues surrounding late-term abortion remain contentious for the party.\n\nRecent comments by 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg (D-IN) about late-term abortions have sparked controversy, with some accusing him of alienating pro-life Democrats. Buttigieg stated that the decision should be the pregnant person's, not the government's.\n\nThe debate on these contentious issues is likely to continue, as both parties seek to appeal to their respective bases ahead of the 2020 elections.",
    " Title: Bannon Faces Criticism for Role in Roy Moore's Alabama Senate Loss\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the defeat of Republican candidate Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is facing criticism for his involvement in the campaign. Bannon was one of Moore's earliest and most vocal supporters, campaigning for him both before and after the allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced.\n\nMatt Drudge, the conservative news aggregator, quickly commented on the election results, stating, \"Luther Strange would have won in a landslide\u2026 Just too much crazy in nerve-racking times. There is a limit!\" Strange was President Trump's preferred candidate in the primary race, leading many to point their finger back at Bannon for the whole debacle.\n\nSteve Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, released a statement saying, \"This is a brutal reminder that candidate quality matters regardless of where you are running. Not only did Steve Bannon cost us a critical Senate seat in one of the most Republican states in the country, but he also dragged the President of the United States into his fiasco.\"\n\nBen Shapiro, editor in chief of The Daily Wire and a former Breitbart editor, also weighed in, writing, \"Bannon's sure showing those establishment cucks a thing or two right now.\" Dana Loesch, a talk radio host, author, and NRA spokeswoman, also criticized Bannon, stating, \"Can we stop now with the 'Bannon is a masterful strategist' nonsense? I've never seen such descriptions used more and deserved less.\"\n\nJosh Holmes, former chief of staff and campaign manager to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, tweeted, \"Before we get the results, I'd just like to thank Steve Bannon for showing us how to lose the reddest state in the union and Governor Ivey for the opportunity to make this national embarrassment a reality.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Megan McCain, co-host of \"The View\" and daughter of Sen. John McCain, simply had this to say: \"Suck it Bannon.\" The criticism comes as Bannon continues to promote his political agenda and influence within the Republican Party.",
    " Title: Grand Jury Indictment Provides Clarity on Russian Election Meddling, Suggests More Revelations to Come\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a Grand Jury for the District of Columbia has charged twelve Russian intelligence officers with conspiring to hack into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The indictment, unsealed on Friday, alleges that the operation targeted over 300 individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign, DCCC, and DNC, and was aimed at interfering with the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe operation, described as sustained and sophisticated, is said to have dominated multiple news cycles, embarrassed key Democrats, and sowed discord within the Democratic party. While it remains unclear if the leaks of hacked emails moved enough votes in key states to swing the election, they were a significant part of the political discourse during the campaign.\n\nThe indictment provides a clearer picture of the alleged Russian election meddling than any other source, and underscores the importance of Special Counsel Robert Mueller being allowed to complete his investigation. This is a valuable public service, and to the extent that he can hold the actual conspirators accountable, it is an act of necessary justice.\n\nThe indictment also provides insight into why intelligence agencies believe that Russians were trying to help Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton. The scale of the attack on the Clinton campaign, the DCCC, and the DNC was troubling, and while there are past reports that the Russians attempted to hack Republicans, this indictment outlines a comprehensive and sustained effort against the Democrats and is silent about a similar conspiracy aimed at Republicans.\n\nThe indictment suggests that more information is coming, including additional information about Russian communication with American citizens. For example, paragraph 43a of the indictment contains the first evidence of possible Russian collusion with an American candidate for public office, not President Trump, but an unnamed candidate for Congress. The indictment also includes a disturbing detail about a transfer of personal identifying information of Democratic donors to a \"state lobbyist and online source of political news.\"\n\nFurthermore, the indictment contains a partial record of communication between the newly indicted Russians and a \"person who was in regular contact with senior members\" of Trump's presidential campaign. While the indictment doesn't establish collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, it clearly indicates that Mueller possesses evidence and information that the public hasn't yet seen.\n\nIn conclusion, this indictment makes it even more troubling that Trump has mocked, denigrated, and undermined the Mueller investigation as a \"witch hunt.\" We now know that there was real wrongdoing; we just don't yet know its extent. We don't yet know if Trump cooperated in any way with Russian schemes. However, when we learn more about the extent of Russian efforts to disrupt the 2016 election (and aid Trump), when we remember that Donald Jr. actually tried to collude, when we ponder for more than a few moments the web of financial connections between senior Trump aides such as Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn and the Kremlin or Kremlin allies, and when we know that Russians contacted Trump friends and advisers to offer \"dirt\" on the Clinton campaign\u2014well, Trump's repeated demands that the investigation end become much less understandable.\n\nRepublicans were rightly outraged when Barack Obama opined about the pending Clinton-email investigation, and we have since learned that his gratuitous and public exoneration of the then\u2013likely Democratic nominee created a headache for the FBI. Now it's time for Republicans to be consistent. As Mueller reveals more facts about Russian interference and indicts more individuals for troubling crimes uncovered as part of his entirely legitimate investigation, it's time for the GOP to tell the president that the hunt needs to continue, because the witches are very real.",
    " Title: Pelosi Calls for Removal of Confederate Statues from U.S. Capitol in Response to Nationwide Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has called for the removal of nearly a dozen Confederate statues from the U.S. Capitol building, following the death of George Floyd and nationwide protests against racial injustice.\n\nIn a letter to Joint Committee on the Library Chairman Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Vice Chair Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., Pelosi wrote, \"The halls of Congress are the very heart of our democracy. The statues in the Capitol should embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation.\"\n\nPelosi pointed out that two of the statues currently in National Statuary Hall, a landmark in the Capitol housing various historical members, are the statues of the president and vice president of the Confederate States, Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens \u2013 both of whom were charged with treason against the United States.\n\nThe speaker also noted Stephens' infamous speech on the Confederacy, in which he stated, \"Our new government is founded upon \u2026 the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.\"\n\n\"Monuments to men who advocated cruelty and barbarism to achieve such a plainly racist end are a grotesque affront to these ideals,\" Pelosi wrote Thursday. \"Their statues pay homage to hate, not heritage. They must be removed.\"\n\nVice Chair Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., told Fox News, \"I agree that the Joint Committee and Architect of the Capitol should expediently remove these symbols of cruelty and bigotry from the halls of the Capitol.\"\n\n\"I stand ready, and call on the Chair of the Joint Committee to swiftly approve the removal of these statues,\" Lofgren added.\n\nPelosi attempted to have the Confederate statues removed in 2017, appealing to then-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\n\n\"The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,\" Pelosi wrote to Ryan in August 2017. \"If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately.\"\n\nRyan argued that it should be up to the states that placed them in Statuary Hall to remove them. While states have the right to switch out their statue of choice from the Hall, Congress has the final say on what is and is not allowed to be kept in the Capitol.\n\nAccording to a 1864 law passed by Congress, Statuary Hall allows each state to place up to two statues in the Hall. The law was further amended in 2000, to allow states to replace sculptures placed in the Hall.\n\n\"Under the law, each state decides which two statues it will send to the Capitol. Several states have moved toward replacing statues and others appear headed in the same direction. This process is ongoing and encouraging,\" Blunt told Fox News.\n\n\"As Speaker Pelosi is undoubtedly aware, the law does not permit the Architect of the Capitol or the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library to remove a statue from the Capitol once it has been received,\" Blunt added.\n\nAccording to a Congressional Research Service report completed in 2019, \"The Architect of the Capitol (AOC), upon the approval of the Joint Committee on the Library... is authorized... to locate or relocate collection statues within the Capitol.\"\n\n\"While I believe it is imperative that we never forget our history lest we repeat it, I also believe that there is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,\" Pelosi wrote to Blunt Wednesday.",
    " Title: New Research Suggests Microplastic Pollution in Oceans and Rivers May Be More Prevalent Than Previously Thought\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study has revealed that the abundance of microplastic pollution in the oceans may have been significantly underestimated, with researchers finding at least double the number of particles compared to previous estimates. The research, led by Prof Pennie Lindeque of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the UK, suggests that there are between 12 trillion and 125 trillion microplastic particles on the ocean surface, as opposed to the previous range of 5 trillion to 50 trillion particles.\n\nThe researchers trawled waters off the coasts of the UK and US, using nets with a fine mesh size to capture smaller particles that are often missed by the coarser nets typically used to filter microplastics. The addition of these smaller particles to global estimates of surface microplastics increases the range from between 5tn and 50tn particles to 12tn-125tn particles, the scientists say.\n\nPlastic pollution is known to harm the fertility, growth, and survival of marine life. Smaller particles are particularly concerning because they are the same size as the food eaten by zooplankton, which underpin the marine food chain and play an important role in regulating the global climate. The new data suggests there may be more microplastic particles than zooplankton in some waters.\n\n\"The estimate of marine microplastic concentration could currently be vastly underestimated,\" said Prof Lindeque. She added that there may well be even smaller particles than those caught by the fine mesh nets, meaning the numbers \"could be even larger again.\"\n\nAnother new study shows how microplastics have entered the food chain in rivers, with birds found to be consuming hundreds of particles a day via the aquatic insects on which they feed. Microplastic pollution has contaminated the whole planet, from Arctic snow and mountain soils to many rivers and the deepest oceans. It is also being consumed and inhaled by people, and the health impacts are as yet unknown.\n\nResearch published in the last month has found microplastics in greater quantities than ever before on the seabed and suggested that hundreds of thousands of tonnes of microplastics could be blowing ashore on the ocean breeze every year.\n\nThe research by Lindeque's team, published in the journal Environmental Pollution, used nets with mesh sizes of 100 microns (0.1mm), 333 microns, and 500 microns. They found 2.5 times more particles in the finest net than in the 333 micron net, which is the kind usually used to filter microplastics, and 10 times more than in the 500 micron net.\n\nThe surface trawls off the coast of Plymouth in the UK and the coast of Maine in the US showed similar results, suggesting they are representative of waters near populated land. The particles were dominated by fibers from textiles such as ropes, nets, and clothing.\n\n\"Using an extrapolation, we suggest microplastic concentrations could exceed 3,700 particles per cubic meter - that's far more than the number of zooplankton you would find,\" Lindeque said. These tiny animals are among the most abundant species on the planet.\n\nDr Ceri Lewis, a marine biologist at Exeter University, who was part of the team, said: \"Understanding more about the smaller microplastics is important as it is these smaller particles that are more likely to be ingested by the zooplankton that form the basis of marine food webs.\"\n\nThe research on microplastics in rivers, published in the journal Global Change Biology, analyzed the droppings and regurgitated pellets of white-throated dippers at 15 river sites in south Wales. The scientists found that the birds, which feed on river insects, were eating about 200 pieces of plastic a day. These were mostly fibers, and a quarter were larger than 500 microns.\n\nThe team also found that the dippers were feeding thousands of plastic fibers to their nest-bound chicks during their development. Previous research by the scientists had shown that half of the river insects contain microplastic fragments.\n\nProf Steve Ormerod, of Cardiff University, who led the work, said: \"In almost 40 years of researching rivers and dippers, I never imagined that one day our work would reveal these spectacular birds to be at risk from the ingestion of plastics. It is a measure of how this pollution problem has crept up on us.\"\n\n\"Dippers are the world's only songbirds able to dive and feed on river insects, but that wonderful adaptation also means they have no escape from this pollution,\" Ormerod said. The impact on the health of the birds is not yet understood. \"It is imperative we understand whether microplastics add to the other pollution problems that affect dippers and other river organisms, and we use that knowledge to guide remedial action,\" Ormerod said.",
    " Title: Sen. Rand Paul Introduces Bill to Abolish No-Knock Warrants, Citing Breonna Taylor's Death\n\nArticle:\n\nSenator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has introduced a bill aimed at ending no-knock warrants, a measure that has garnered bipartisan support as lawmakers grapple with broader police reform discussions. The proposed legislation, titled the Justice for Breonna Taylor Act, would prohibit federal law enforcement from executing a warrant without prior notice of their authority and purpose.\n\nThe bill also extends to state and local law enforcement agencies that receive funding from the Department of Justice. In a statement, Senator Paul expressed his conviction that it is \"long past time to get rid of no-knock warrants.\" He stated that the bill, if passed, would effectively end no-knock raids in the United States.\n\nThe proposed legislation comes in the wake of the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who was killed during a detainment by Minneapolis police. The bill is a response to the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was fatally shot in her home in Kentucky during a no-knock warrant execution by police.\n\nCongress is currently debating how to respond to Floyd's death, with proposals from House and Senate Democrats suggesting a ban on no-knock warrants in federal drug cases and tying law enforcement funding to state and local agencies on a similar ban. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) is drafting a Senate GOP proposal, which he is expected to unveil next week.\n\nSenator Paul's legislation also follows a recent controversy involving Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), with whom he had sparred over an amendment to the bill that would make lynching a federal hate crime. Paul had proposed an amendment that would apply a serious bodily injury standard, ensuring that crimes resulting in substantial risk of death and extreme physical pain would be prosecuted as lynching. However, Harris and Booker accused him of attempting to water down the bill.",
    " Title: Progressive Movement Remains Divided as Bernie Sanders Endorses Joe Biden for Democrat Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders' endorsement of Joe Biden for the Democrat nomination has not been met with unanimous support from the progressive movement that powered his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. On Monday, Briahna Joy Gray, a former spokeswoman for Sanders, announced that she was not following suit, citing Biden's unwillingness to adopt progressive stances on the economy and healthcare.\n\nGray, who has been vocal about her disagreements with other high-profile national Democrats, wrote on social media, \"With the utmost respect for Bernie Sanders, who is an incredible human being and a genuine inspiration, I don't endorse Joe Biden.\"\n\nShe added, \"I supported Bernie Sanders because he backed ideas like Medicare for All, cancelling ALL student debt, and a wealth tax. Biden supports none of those.\"\n\nThe ideological differences that Gray noted highlight the challenge that lies ahead for Biden. Since the former vice president routed his opposition on Super Tuesday to become the presumptive nominee, progressives aligned with Sanders have been exploring their options for the general election. Many seem to have found Biden, who has unequivocally come out against universal healthcare and has shown disdain for the \"socialist\" label, wanting.\n\nIn recent weeks, as it became apparent that the former vice president would be the nominee, a small but vocal \"Never Biden\" community has sprouted up on social media. Its members include former campaign operatives, sympathetic media pundits, and the types of average voters that made Sanders' 2016 insurgent campaign possible.\n\nBiden, for his part, has offered several olive branches to the disaffected Sanders supporters. Last month, the former vice president opted to adopt the bankruptcy proposal authored by his former rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The decision was a full repudiation of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which Biden authored, and progressives have long claimed was a giveaway to big banks. Biden's shift on bankruptcy was followed up last week by an embrace of lowering the age of Medicaid eligibility to 60 and student loan forgiveness for individuals making below $125,000-per-year.\n\nHowever, these efforts have not been successful. More than a few members of Sanders' political movement have rejected the olive branches as not going far enough. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who endorsed the Vermont senator last year and campaigned for him ahead of the Iowa Caucuses, described Biden's proposal as \"almost an insult.\"\n\n\"I think Hillary [Clinton] was looking at policies that lowered it to 50,\" the congresswoman told The New York Times in an interview published Monday. \"So we're talking about a 'progressive concession' that is ten years worse than what the nominee had in 2016.\"\n\nPolicy differences are not the only reason why many members of Sanders' political movement remain uncommitted about backing Biden. Some, in particular, are concerned about new sexual assault allegations leveled against the former vice president by former staffer Tara Reade.\n\nIn fact, when Reade's allegations first surfaced last month, a top Sanders supporter announced they believed the accusations were true. Others from the Never Biden community soon echoed the sentiment, with some even openly saying the allegations were disqualifying for the former vice president's candidacy.\n\nThis poses a major predicament. In 2016, President Donald Trump won the White House, in part, because disaffected Sanders supporters opted to stay home or vote third party. Decreased turnout for the Democrat ticket that year, coupled with Trump's populist appeals to white working-class voters in the Midwest, led to a GOP victory.\n\nA similar scenario could repeat itself this year. Exit polls from last month's Michigan primary found that only two out of five Sanders supporters would be willing to back Biden in November, according to Politico. If those numbers hold on election day, it would spell disaster for Biden, especially as Michigan is considered a must-win if Democrats have any hope of retaking the White House.\n\nSanders, himself, appears to understand the predicament members of his one-time movement pose for Biden. On Monday, while endorsing the former vice president, the Vermont senator urged his supporters to fall in line behind the Democrat nominee.\n\n\"We must come together to defeat the most dangerous president in modern history,\" Sanders said.",
    " Title: \"Senator Bernie Sanders: A Focus on Policy and Party Shift, Yet Mixed Results in Congress\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the halls of Congress, Senator Bernie Sanders, the self-proclaimed democratic socialist from Vermont, has carved out a unique niche for himself, often working independently and focusing on moving the Democratic Party to the left. This is according to several Democratic representatives and senators, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nRepresentative Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat and a close ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, described Sanders as a lone ranger during his House tenure, with little recall of his collaborations or the specific issues he worked on. His influence in the Senate has been more pronounced, albeit with some challenges.\n\nSenator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio and a labor-allied progressive, noted that while some senators, such as Hubert Humphrey and Teddy Kennedy, excelled in both internal and external strategy, Sanders has chosen to focus on the external strategy. \"Bernie has chosen to pursue the outside strategy,\" said Brown. \"The inside is a means to that end. Bernie clearly looks to build support from the outside. He works with his colleagues, but the outside, that is his strength.\"\n\nSanders' work as the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee has been marked by some challenges. He has faced difficulties in recruiting and retaining top-tier staff for the committee, prompting him to seek the expertise of Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a highly regarded legislative technician who served as committee chair, on complex budget matters.\n\nSanders' approach to legislative work is not without its quirks. A former staff member recalled an instance where Sanders, growing impatient during a discussion of routine committee business, asked an aide, \"What's the news for today?\"\n\nSanders' primary objective, according to the senator himself, has been to shift the Democratic Party to the left, rather than to negotiate compromises within the system. He has had an impact on certain issues, such as challenging both parties' leadership on President Trump's support for Saudi intervention in Yemen. When asked about his most significant legislative achievement in the last year, Sanders pointed to bills aimed at pressuring large employers like Amazon, Disney, and Walmart to improve their pay and benefits.\n\nHowever, Sanders acknowledged that these measures are unlikely to reach the floor. He emphasized, \"The point of the legislation was to tell Amazon, to tell Disney, we are going to stand with workers \u2014 you can have significant success without ever passing a piece of legislation.\"\n\nDespite his curmudgeonly demeanor, Sanders has made efforts to maintain a positive working relationship with Senator Elizabeth Warren. Recently, he was seen huddling with her in a Senate hallway to resolve a disagreement between their campaigns on Twitter.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush's Presidential Campaign Faces Fundraising Challenges as Donor Support Wanes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to maintain the momentum of his presidential campaign, Jeb Bush is facing difficulties as he slips in the polls and top Republican donors remain hesitant in committing their support. In an email sent to contributors on Friday, a finance aide for Mr. Bush invited them to a breakfast fund-raiser in Washington next month, emphasizing the need for \"new money only.\"\n\nThe email, penned by Sarah Corsaro, staff member, indicates that the former Florida governor's initial push to raise funds after announcing his candidacy in June has been successful among Washington-based donors capable of giving the legally allowed $2,700. However, the campaign is now seeking to add wealthy donors who have not previously contributed to Mr. Bush.\n\nThe co-chair committee for the $1,000-per-person breakfast offers insight into Mr. Bush's focus on finding new donors. The list is heavy with family, friends, and former aides and loyalists to his father, brother, and himself.\n\nDespite raising a combined $114 million for his campaign and \"super PAC\" in the first half of the year, Mr. Bush's position in the Republican polls has become precarious, with Donald J. Trump unexpectedly surging. This reluctance from top money raisers, coupled with the possibility of a prolonged Republican primary contest, has led Mr. Bush to implement cost-saving measures in his campaign. Some aides have reportedly seen their pay reduced as part of an effort to curtail spending.\n\nAdditionally, on Friday, three of Mr. Bush's Florida fund-raising consultants left the campaign after reportedly clashing with the new leadership team Mr. Bush installed in June. Mr. Bush's campaign manager, Danny Diaz, has reportedly pushed staffers to work longer hours and be more cost-conscious.\n\nTim Miller, communications director for Mr. Bush, commented on the departures, stating, \"Ann Herberger is his longtime fund-raising consultant in Florida. We have a full-time finance staff in Miami HQ, as well. These are consultants with multiple clients. We moved in a different direction.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Halts Funding to World Health Organization: A Divisive Decision Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked heated debate, the White House announced in April that the United States would halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) pending a review of the organization's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S., traditionally the largest funder of the WHO, is followed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe WHO, a part of the United Nations, is composed of and run by 194 member nations. Member states choose a delegation to represent the country in the World Health Assembly, and the Executive Board operationalizes policies set by the World Health Assembly. The WHO, established in 1948, has a history of successes, such as eradicating smallpox, and perceived failures, like its delayed response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014.\n\nThe WHO is funded by assessed contributions and voluntary contributions. Assessed contributions are required of each member state, scaled by income and population. Voluntary contributions, on the other hand, may be made by member states (in addition to assessed contributions) or by individual donors. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the second-largest funder of the WHO via voluntary contributions, with voluntary contributions making up 80% of the total funding.\n\nThe WHO's objective is to monitor and coordinate activities related to health issues, including genetically modified foods, climate change, tobacco and drug use, and road safety. However, the organization's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been met with criticism, particularly concerning China's influential role in the information released during the early stages of the crisis.\n\nA new article in the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine states, \"Influence from powerful political donors, which has become most evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic, the global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system, nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the WHO.\"\n\nThe White House's move to halt funding entirely during the pandemic has also been met with considerable criticism. The key points made by proponents of halting WHO funds and opponents to halting WHO funds will be discussed in the analysis below.\n\nBoth sides agree that the world needs effective and coordinated leadership to respond to global health crises. Proponents argue that halting WHO funding is necessary to address the missteps and clear political bias demonstrated by the WHO, while opponents claim it's irresponsible to discontinue funding of the world's most influential health organization in the middle of a pandemic.",
    " Title: North Korea Agrees to Dialogue with U.S. on Denuclearization, Suspend Nuclear and Missile Tests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant diplomatic development, North Korea has expressed its willingness to engage in open-ended dialogue with the United States regarding denuclearization and normalizing relations with the U.S. This announcement follows unprecedented meetings between high-ranking South Korean officials and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nAccording to South Korea's national security chief, Chung Eui-yong, Kim Jong Un has agreed to refrain from conducting nuclear and missile tests while engaging in dialogue with both South Korea and the U.S. The North Korean leader also expressed a desire to hold talks with the U.S. to discuss denuclearization and normalizing relations.\n\nThe U.S. President, Donald Trump, has expressed optimism about North Korea's sincerity in these peace talks. He stated, \"I really believe they are sincere. I hope they are sincere. We'll find out.\" The U.S. will reportedly move forward with joint military exercises with South Korea.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un are scheduled to meet for a summit at the demilitarized zone in April. The two leaders will also establish a direct communication hotline, according to Chung.\n\nThe U.S. is looking for North Korea to take concrete actions or \"credible moves\" toward denuclearization before agreeing to direct talks. The U.S. and South Korea expect to proceed with their joint military exercises.\n\nNorth Korea's statements on denuclearization are not a complete U-turn, as the country has long maintained its nuclear weapons development is a response to perceived U.S. hostility. Experts suggest that this diplomatic thaw offers an opportunity for further negotiations.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea had postponed joint military exercises during the Winter Olympics but the drills were expected to resume after the Paralympics. It remains unclear whether these developments will alter the resumption of the exercises.\n\nThis diplomatic accomplishment is a significant achievement for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has been a proponent of dialogue and engagement with North Korea since his days as a presidential aide. The April summit will take place at Panmunjom Peace House on the South Korean side of the demilitarized zone that divides the two countries. The last inter-Korean summit was in 2007.",
    " Title: Opposition Slams Indian Government Over Deadly New Delhi Riots, Calls for Home Minister's Resignation\n\nArticle:\n\nIndia's opposition politicians have criticized the Hindu nationalist government for the deadly anti-Muslim violence that erupted in New Delhi, with the main opposition Congress party calling for the resignation of the interior minister, Amit Shah. The violence, which occurred during a state visit by US President Donald Trump, resulted in the deaths of 52 people, mostly Muslims, and the destruction or damage of 19 mosques.\n\nOpposition leader Asaduddin Owaisi, the chief of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party, accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of spreading hatred against Muslims, the country's largest minority. During a stirring speech, Owaisi questioned the dignity of Muslims in the face of such violence and asked if the government had any humanity left.\n\n\"What is my dignity when 19 mosques have been destroyed or damaged? What is my dignity when I see a saffron flag being erected on a mosque?,\" Owaisi said, referring to the flag associated with Hindu far-right groups that was planted on a mosque minaret during the violence.\n\nOpposition Congress party members of Parliament walked out after Home Minister Amit Shah praised the police for ending the rioting in northeastern areas of the capital within 36 hours and preventing it from spreading across New Delhi.\n\nThe violence followed a series of anti-Muslim hate speeches by BJP leaders, including Kapil Mishra, who warned Muslims protesting against a new citizenship law to wind down their sit-ins in northeast Delhi. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), passed last December, fast-tracks naturalization for minorities of all major faiths in South Asia except Islam.\n\nMuslims and liberal Indians say the CAA is against the officially secular nation's constitution and is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agenda of Hindu supremacy.\n\nHome Minister Amit Shah, in a statement to the lower house of the Indian Parliament, said, \"Nobody likes riots. Riots should not take place during any government's rule.\" He assured strict action would be taken against the perpetrators of violence and offered his condolences to the families of those killed during the riots.\n\nAccording to media reports, Muslims have suffered most of the damages to their properties and religious structures, with many of them living in relief camps. The home minister blamed inflammatory speeches by the Congress party and some Muslim leaders for triggering the rioting.\n\nAnother senior Congress leader, Kapil Sibal, accused the government of protecting the guilty and failing to protect the innocent. \"We know what will happen. You will punish the innocent and give protection to the guilty. Even when you know who the accused are, no FIRs are filed. Don't let such a thing happen,\" Sibal said in Parliament.\n\nOwaisi accused the government of failing in discharging its constitutional duties to save the lives of Indians. \"Do you have any remorse on your faces? Do you have any embarrassment for what has happened right under your nose? No. You have no embarrassment, you take pride on the dead bodies, which are lying in drains,\" said Owaisi, who has emerged as a leading voice of Indian Muslims.\n\nOwaisi also referred to the 2002 Gujarat pogrom, during which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed under Modi's chief ministership. Modi and his close aide Shah have not visited the violence-affected areas of Delhi, with Modi's only comment being a call for calm on his Twitter handle.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Criticism Over Democrats' Refusal to Replenish Paycheck Protection Program Funding\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint statement on Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) criticized Democrats and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for their refusal to approve additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) of the CARES Act. The PPP, which provides job-saving loans to small businesses, is expected to exhaust its funding in a matter of hours, according to the Small Business Administration and the Department of the Treasury.\n\nThe PPP, which was on track to exhaust most of its initial allocation of $350 billion, had approved more than 1.5 million loans worth over $324 billion as of late Wednesday, with loans still being processed. Both Democrats and Republicans have expressed a desire to add $250 billion to the small-business aid program, but have been at odds over whether to include additional restrictions on the funds. Democrats have advocated for expanding access to the loans, as well as allocating more funds for hospitals, food assistance, and state and local governments. Republicans, on the other hand, have called for keeping the bill focused on increasing small-business aid and deferring other funding discussions until the next, broader legislation is crafted.\n\nThe statement from McConnell and McCarthy accused Democrats of blocking emergency funding for Americans' paychecks, leading to the depletion of the PPP. \"This did not have to happen,\" the statement read. \"Last Thursday, Senate Republicans tried to pass a narrow and clean bill that would have simply put more money into this critical program without changing any of the underlying policies that passed the Senate and the House unanimously. Democrats blocked it.\"\n\nThe criticism comes as the U.S. continues to grapple with the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan, China. The U.S., which has led the world in widespread testing, has reported nearly 630,000 confirmed cases and over 25,000 reported deaths from the virus. The hardest-hit states in the U.S. are New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, and California. The New York City area has been the hardest-hit area in the country, accounting for nearly one-third of all coronavirus cases in the U.S. and nearly half the deaths in the U.S.\n\nThe statement also took aim at the Democrats' approach to the PPP funding, stating, \"It has been stunning to watch our Democratic colleagues treat emergency funding for Americans' paychecks like a Republican priority which they need to be goaded into supporting. Funding a bipartisan program should not be a partisan issue. The notion that crucial help for working people is not appealing enough to Democrats without other additions sends a strange message about their priorities.\"\n\nThe statement concluded with a call for Democrats to reconsider their position and approve the additional funding for the PPP. \"The cost of continued Democratic obstruction will be pink slips and shuttered businesses,\" the statement read. \"We hope Democrats see reason soon and finally heed Republicans' repeated calls for a funding bill that can quickly earn unanimous consent from all 100 senators and become law.\"",
    " Title: George Conway, Husband of Kellyanne Conway, Expected to Head Civil Division of Department of Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, George Conway, the husband of Kellyanne Conway and a partner at one of New York's most prestigious law firms, is expected to take on a major role in defending the Trump administration. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, Conway is set to be nominated to head the civil division of the Department of Justice. If confirmed by the Senate, Conway would be responsible for leading the defense of the administration in lawsuits.\n\nThe expected nomination comes as the Justice Department prepares appeals of rulings that blocked President Trump's revised travel ban. The president has vowed to see his executive order through, even if it means bringing it to the Supreme Court. This legal battle could potentially place Conway at the center of the ongoing debate surrounding the travel ban.\n\nThe executive order, which seeks to restrict travel from six predominantly Muslim nations, was blocked by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland last week. The Trump administration has argued that the ban is necessary to help fight terrorism. However, US District Judge Derrick Watson of Hawaii and US District Judge Theodore Chuang of Maryland found in two separate rulings that the order unfairly targets Muslim travelers.\n\nIn Hawaii, Judge Watson noted that courts should not examine \"secret motives\" of government officials, but said the intention of Trump's order was clear, citing \"significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus\" behind the ban.\n\nThe Trump administration filed court papers on Friday to challenge the Maryland ruling, setting up a new legal showdown in the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. Trump has vowed to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court to get the ban reinstated.\n\nIf confirmed, Conway, a graduate of Harvard University and Yale Law School, would likely play a major role in the Justice Department's challenge in this case. A respected Republican lawyer, Conway has represented a long list of corporate clients, including Phillip Morris, Cardinal Health, and the National Football League. He also clerked for US Circuit Judge Ralph Winter, Jr. of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, who was nominated to the court by former President Reagan. According to Conway's biography on his firm's website, he has worked on major securities law cases and deal litigation.\n\nConway was previously considered for the post of solicitor general of the Justice Department, a position that ultimately went to Noel Francisco.\n\nKellyanne Conway, Conway's wife, has been an influential member of the Trump team since the election. A longtime Republican pollster, she is credited with helping turn around the Trump campaign when the candidate was trailing Hillary Clinton. After the Trump's victory, Kellyanne joined the administration as a counselor to the president.

We believe in the free market, and a light touch when it comes to regulations.\"\n\nThe President's remarks come in the face of criticism that his administration has implemented a higher number of burdensome regulations compared to previous administrations. A report by the Heritage Foundation last year found that the Obama administration adopted 106 \"major regulations\" in its first three years, compared to 28 during the same timeframe under President George W. Bush. A study by the left-leaning OMB Watch found that the total regulations adopted by the Obama administration are roughly equal to the number adopted by other administrations over the past 18 years.\n\nAt the fundraiser, President Obama also highlighted the need for a regulatory structure that encourages clean energy development and protects intellectual property. He emphasized the government's role in funding science, research, infrastructure, and education.\n\nThe President made a call for a \"functioning government,\" stating that Republicans often engage in \"stubbornness.\" He underscored the government's critical role in these areas and expressed the need for a Democratic Senate and House to accomplish these goals.\n\n\"For us to accomplish that,\" the President said, \"we're going to need to have a Democratic Senate. For us to accomplish that, I'd also like a Democratic House. I just want to get stuff done. On too much of the big stuff, what we see coming out of the other party is an interest in winning elections or in obstruction, not enough interest in solving problems.\"",
    " Title: Democrats Embrace Obamacare for 2014 Midterms: A Shift in Strategy Amidst Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising move, Democrats have decided to embrace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) for the 2014 midterm elections, a strategy born out of years of Republican criticism and anticipated attacks. This new approach represents a significant shift from 2010, when the law was used as a political weapon by the Republicans in their successful bid to seize the House from the Democrats.\n\nThe Democratic strategy, a high-wire public relations act, reflects the party's acceptance of the fact that it is difficult, if not impossible, to disassociate from the law. The White House has long struggled with messaging on Obamacare, hoping that the public would come to appreciate the health care reforms as its benefits became apparent. However, this never materialized, and Democrats now seem to be banking on the belief that the public will finally understand the benefits of the law.\n\nThe strategy will be tested as the law is implemented and the public gets its first-hand experience of the massive undertaking. With the inevitable glitches and negative media coverage, the public's first close-up view of the law's implementation will provide a challenging backdrop for the elections.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Scott Peters, a freshman Democrat who narrowly won his election last year, expressed his support for the law, despite not agreeing with every aspect of it. He emphasized his readiness to discuss health care, stating that it is a significant issue and will likely be a topic of greater discussion than immigration or guns.\n\nOne early sign of the shift is the response to the recent House Republicans' health care repeal measure. Peters, along with other Democratic incumbents from competitive districts, criticized the GOP for the move. In contrast to 2010, when Democratic congressional candidates in tough races actively promoted their opposition to the law, the 2014 strategy involves discussing the law's positives, positioning themselves as consumer advocates, and going on the offensive against Republicans for wanting to repeal the benefits.\n\nWhile not every Democrat will be singing the law's praises, Democratic strategists believe there are plenty of appealing aspects of the law, such as coverage for pre-existing conditions, eliminating lifetime caps on coverage, and allowing children to stay on their parents' health care plans until they are 26. They are coaching lawmakers and candidates gearing up for tough races next year to emphasize these benefits.",
    " Title: Controversy Arises as Montefiore Medical Center Continues to Require Non-Essential Staff to Work In-Office Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nAmidst New York state's mandate for companies to allow employees to work from home as much as possible, the Montefiore Medical Center, an academic hospital located in the Bronx, is continuing to have non-essential workers at the Rose F. Kennedy Children's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center (CERC) report to the office. This decision has raised concerns among the hospital workers themselves, who are primarily developmental pediatricians, psychologists, social workers, language and occupational therapists, and are connecting with patients via phone or video conferencing as their patients have been advised to avoid in-person sessions.\n\nOne employee, who requested anonymity due to fear of repercussions at their job, expressed their concerns, stating, \"People are so frightened and really angry. It's dangerous. There have been tons of COVID-19 cases everywhere at this point, especially in New York, and there's a real lack of transparency here. We don't really know what we're walking into, even though there are constant reassurances that we're safe. It doesn't feel that way.\"\n\nCERC, one of the many clinics associated with Montefiore, focuses on helping children with language disorders, behavioral problems, and other disabilities. According to internal emails reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588, CERC classified its employees as part of a \"nonessential medical service\" as recently as March 11. Despite this classification, CERC continued to demand these clinicians report to the office and work at full capacity until March 30, two weeks after Mayor Bill de Blasio closed down the New York City school system. Now, employees are instead commuting a few times per week, as opposed to every day. The employee \u2588\u2588\u2588 spoke to estimated that this likely affects as many as 150 people.\n\nThe employee expressed concern that they and others could potentially contract the coronavirus or spread it to others, as they are not required to leave their homes to perform their jobs. \"It's absurd,\" the employee said. \"Therapists are trying to figure out how to deliver therapy virtually all over the world. I understand it's difficult\u2014I do\u2014but other hospitals are doing that more effectively. We don't need to be here physically.\"\n\nOther New York hospitals, such as the Mount Sinai Health System and NYU Langone Medical Center, appear to have been developing work-at-home measures for nonessential employees for close to a month. Montefiore did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nCERC has asserted in emails that Montefiore is \"on top of things\" and appropriately responding to the global pandemic. However, the center did not require its staff to wear masks at work until just last week, according to the employee, and it appeared to react slowly overall to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIt took until March 23 for the administration at CERC to announce in an email that Montefiore would allow the clinic to operate at \"a reduced workforce by 50%,\" which permitted \"all staff [to] work from home for a portion of each week.\" CERC has since taken further precautions, such as temperature checks of employees, and has advised people to wash their hands, avoid touching their faces, and stand at least six feet away from one another, according to an email. (The employee said that it was unclear whether Montefiore or CERC itself was implementing these changes.)\n\nRegardless, nonessential hospital workers are still being asked to travel to work and operate on a staggered schedule\u2014either two or three days out of the work week. There, they isolate themselves in their offices, phones and computers in hand.\n\n\"Really, it's as if I don't know who is making decisions about my work or life right now,\" the employee said. \"It's so mysterious how these choices are even being made.\"",
    " Title: Impact of Trump's Immigration Policy on U.S. Agriculture Industry\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has outlined a series of measures aimed at tightening immigration policies, which could have significant implications for the U.S. agriculture industry. According to a study cited by Bloomberg, as much as 70 percent of the U.S. farm workforce lacks valid immigration papers. With the potential removal of undocumented workers, it could be challenging to find American citizens willing to take on farm jobs, leading to a significant increase in wages.\n\nBank of America's Ethan Harris suggests that a \"very dramatic increase in wages\" would be necessary to attract workers from urban areas to rural farming communities. This increase could strain the farm industry, which is already expected to see profits fall for the fourth year in a row. The higher wages could lead to significant price increases for consumers, making farm produce more expensive.\n\nIf the administration does not implement increases in workers available through legal guest-worker programs, farm operations could shut down, as stated by Zaid Kurdieh of Norwich Meadows Farm.\n\nMoreover, a study commissioned by the American Farm Bureau Federation in 2014 suggests that an immigration policy focused on closing the border could shift as much as 61 percent of U.S. fruit production to other countries and send jobs to nearby nations such as Mexico. This is partly due to the higher wage costs making U.S. foods less competitive.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has denied that the immigration crackdown is a \"military operation,\" but the potential consequences for the agriculture industry are clear: higher wages, increased food prices, and potential relocation of farm jobs to other countries. The administration has yet to provide a clear plan for addressing these potential issues through legal guest-worker programs.",
    " Title: Cuomo Brothers' Divergent Stances on Abortion and Economy Reveal Inherited Philosophical Inconsistency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the Cuomo brothers, Chris and Andrew, have been making headlines for their contrasting views on two contentious issues: the restarting of the economy and abortion rights. Both brothers, sons of the late Governor Mario Cuomo, have inherited their father's eloquent oratory, but their moral philosophies seem to be incoherent and inconsistent.\n\nMario Cuomo was known for his passionate speeches on various subjects, except for abortion, where he would maintain a silent stance, stating he was \"personally opposed\" to it. His sons, however, have not followed this precedent. Andrew Cuomo, the current Governor of New York, is publicly and personally supportive of abortion rights.\n\nLast year, Governor Cuomo signed into law the most liberal abortion law in the country. He stated, \"Today we are taking a giant step forward in the hard-fought battle to ensure a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own personal health, including the ability to access an abortion.\" He further added, \"With the signing of this bill, we are sending a clear message that whatever happens in Washington, women in New York will always have the fundamental right to control their own body.\"\n\nAfter the law's passage, he ordered New York's landmarks to be lit in pink to celebrate this achievement and set a positive example for the rest of the nation.\n\nPart of his justification for abortion rights is the need for women to have them in order to have careers. In other words, he is willing to sacrifice unborn children for the perceived economic good of women, a line of reasoning he rejects in the case of the elderly. This week, he stated he would not put the \"elderly at risk\" to \"boost the economy.\"\n\nNew York is responsible for many of the abortions in America today. In a recent press conference, Cuomo said, \"My mother is not expendable and your mother is not expendable and our brothers and sisters are not expendable. We're not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable, and we're not going to put a dollar figure on human life.\"\n\nIn contrast, Chris Cuomo, the CNN anchor, has been vocal about the need to restart the economy, while criticizing those who suggest otherwise. The brothers' stances highlight an inconsistency in their moral philosophy, as they seem to value the lives of the elderly and unborn differently.\n\nThis inconsistency in their moral philosophy, inherited from their father, raises questions about their underlying beliefs and the principles they uphold. It remains to be seen how they will navigate these complex issues in the future.",

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) drew record ratings for CNN during her town hall event on Monday night, with the network reporting an average of 1.957 million total viewers, a significant 75% increase over its previous four town halls.\n\nAccording to CNN, the town hall \"averaged 1.957 million, a +75% advantage over CNN's prior four (1.119 million).\" Harris's campaign quickly took to Twitter to celebrate the ratings success.\n\nThe California Democrat is capitalizing on her early fundraising momentum and grassroots support as the Democratic primary field continues to expand. Last week, the Harris campaign reported raising over $1.5 million in online donations within 24 hours of announcing her presidential bid. Harris also held a high-profile rally on Sunday to officially launch her campaign.\n\nRecent polling indicates Harris is gaining ground in the primary race, with her standing among potential contenders such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas). Other notable Democrats, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), have either declared their candidacy or expressed interest in running in 2020.\n\nWith as many as 30 candidates expected to compete in the Democratic primary, many will likely attempt to appeal to the party's progressive wing. Harris's town hall event on CNN provided her with a platform to showcase her policy proposals and connect with voters ahead of the primary elections.",
    " Title: Unprecedented White House Security Breach: President Obama Backs Secret Service Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has expressed his support for the Secret Service following an unprecedented security breach at the White House on Friday evening. The incident, which occurred shortly after the Obama family departed for a weekend at Camp David in Maryland, saw a man with a knife manage to enter the front door of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nWhite House spokesman Frank Benenati stated that the President has \"full confidence in the Secret Service and is grateful to the men and women who day in and day out protect himself, his family, and the White House.\" The intrusion prompted the evacuation of the West Wing.\n\nRep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) has called for a full investigation into the incident, stating, \"This demands a full investigation, an investigation as to what happened, why it happened, and what's being done to make sure it never happens again.\"\n\nOn Saturday, a man was taken into custody for refusing to leave a gate at one end of Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House. Earlier, the man had attempted to enter the White House grounds through a gate on site, but was turned away. There is no sign that the Friday and Saturday incidents are related.\n\nOn Friday, Omar Gonzalez, a 42-year-old man from Copperas Cove, Texas, managed to jump the fence on Pennsylvania Avenue and sprint some 70 yards to the White House itself before being subdued. He has been charged with unlawful entry into restricted grounds while carrying a deadly weapon.\n\nGonzalez, an Army veteran, enlisted in 1997 and was assigned to the 10th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, at Fort Hood, Texas. He was discharged in September 2003 after completing his service obligation. Gonzalez enlisted again in 2005 and served until his retirement in late 2012.\n\nSecret Service members did not open fire on the intruder, nor did they release guard dogs. The Associated Press, citing a criminal complaint against Gonzalez, reported that he told the Secret Service he was \"concerned that the atmosphere was collapsing\" and needed to contact the president \"so he could get word out to the people.\"\n\nIn a statement announcing the investigation, the Secret Service said that while \"the officers showed tremendous restraint and discipline in dealing with this subject, the location of Gonzalez's arrest is not acceptable.\" Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has ordered an investigation by the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility.\n\nThe incident occurred amid heightened security at the presidential residence, with a video released by the Islamic State jihadist group appearing to direct a threat at the White House. In response, Pierson has ordered the immediate enhancement of officer patrols and surveillance capabilities along the Pennsylvania Avenue fence line around the White House complex.",
    " Title: \"Klobuchar's Campaign Strategy: A Focus on Rural Voters and Bipartisan Approach\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the competitive 2020 Democratic presidential race, Amy Klobuchar's campaign strategy appears to be centered on her ability to appeal to rural, independent voters, particularly in her home state of Minnesota, and her bipartisan approach to politics. This strategy, reminiscent of comfort food, is a departure from the more radical policies proposed by some of her competitors.\n\nKlobuchar, who has been averaging two percent in the last three polls in New Hampshire, believes her success in appealing to rural, independent voters in Minnesota can translate to the Granite State. She attributes her appeal to her similarity in style and substance to the state's top elected Democrats, Senators Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen.\n\nThe three senators are known for their quiet, effective work in passing bills and their avoidance of rah-rah rhetoric in their speeches. They generally steer clear of proposals like Medicare for All or free college for all, which are more popular among the liberal wing of the party.\n\nKlobuchar's supporters, such as former state Attorney General Joe Foster, believe she is seeing a wave rather than a peak in her campaign. Foster, who saw 14 candidates before settling on Klobuchar, praises her steady approach and believes her momentum will build up to the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries.\n\nDespite her more moderate stance, Klobuchar is not shy about discussing the impracticalities of some of her competitors' proposals when asked by voters. This pragmatic approach, combined with her bipartisan record in the Senate, may help her appeal to a broader electorate in the upcoming primaries.\n\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588, Klobuchar discussed her close relationship with Senators Hassan and Shaheen, with whom she plays the New York Times mini-crossword puzzle every day. This close bond, along with her pragmatic approach and bipartisan record, may help Klobuchar differentiate herself in the crowded field of Democratic candidates.",
    " Title: Americans Prefer a Less Polarized Congress, Reuters-Ipsos Poll Reveals\n\nArticle:\n\nA new Reuters-Ipsos poll has revealed that a majority of Americans believe Congress is more effective when political extremists have less influence. The poll, conducted May 4-12, surveyed 2,749 Americans, with a credibility interval of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points.\n\nThe poll found that 57 percent of respondents believe Congress is more effective when extremists on either side do not have as much leverage, while 22 percent disagreed with this. The poll reinforces the idea that the November 2014 elections were about Americans wanting more effective government.\n\nPenny Mahar, a political independent from Whitesboro, New York, expressed her views, stating, \"It's much too polarized, too political now. Once, when somebody was elected to Congress, they would work with the opposite party to try to make things better for their country. Now they seem more focused on their party than the needs of the people.\"\n\nCongress has become slightly more productive in the last few months, with voters awarding majorities to Republicans in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Bipartisan legislation to rework the pay formula for Medicare doctors was passed last month and signed into law by President Barack Obama. The Senate passed a bipartisan bill on May 7 allowing Congress to review a nuclear deal with Iran, and the House passed the measure on Thursday. There has been no government shutdown since October 2013.\n\nDespite these legislative accomplishments, 53 percent of Americans still had an unfavorable view of Congress, with 47 percent holding a favorable view. These views have not changed over the past six months for three-fifths of those polled.\n\nMike Helferd, also an independent from Hilton Head, South Carolina, echoed the sentiments of many respondents, stating, \"Every once in a while they get something through in spite of themselves.\" Several respondents told a Reuters reporter they had not heard about the recent legislative accomplishments. Most poll respondents, 71 percent, said they viewed Congress as either \"mostly\" or \"completely\" dysfunctional.\n\nSarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, attributed the distaste for extremism shown in the poll to the \"general moderation\" of the U.S. public. \"Despite a more polarized electorate, voters tend to be more moderate than the politicians that they elect to Congress. So it makes sense that a majority would say that Congress is more effective when extremists are marginalized,\" she said.\n\nThe poll did not define \"extremists.\" Some respondents, when asked by Reuters to name groups they considered extremist, suggested Tea Party conservatives, or on the other side of the political spectrum, \"ultra-liberals.\"\n\nSome poll respondents saw reason to hope for more agreement and productivity from Congress soon. Helferd suggested that Tea Party Republicans are already less able than they once were to block legislation they dislike. \"They are so vociferously anti-anything that is not part of their platform, I think they are losing popularity,\" he said.\n\nMahar hoped that Senator Chuck Schumer, expected to become the chamber's next Democratic leader, will work with Republicans to get things done. \"Harry Reid, the current Senate Democratic leader, 'wouldn't move anything,' she said. \"Everything stayed on his desk.\"",
    " Title: Fox News Anchors' Interviews Pose Challenges for Republican Presidential Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Republican National Committee's (RNC) decision to control the debates last year, aiming to shield their candidates from liberal scrutiny, has backfired. The first Republican presidential debate will be aired on Fox News, and the moderators, Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly, and Chris Wallace, have already caused three Republican candidates to stumble in recent interviews.\n\nThe RNC's attempt to install more \"conservatives in the moderator's chair\" was a response to the criticism leveled against some of the 2012 primary debate moderators. Notable instances include ABC's George Stephanopoulos' question about contraception and CNN's John King's question about Newt Gingrich's ex-wife. However, this year, when Republican candidates trip up on the debate stage, they will not have the option to blame the media.\n\nRecent gaffes by Republican candidates on Fox News are not due to the network's journalists being out to get Republicans. Instead, even a softball question can catch an unprepared candidate off guard. For instance, Megyn Kelly's interview of Jeb Bush was a warm, conversational exchange, but her question about the Iraq invasion sparked a media firestorm.\n\nChris Wallace's interview with Marco Rubio was more aggressive, pressing Rubio on his shift in immigration and foreign policy stances. Wallace's questioning style, loaded questions, opinionated assertions, and repeated interruptions would typically earn him a lifetime membership in the Liberal Media Elite Club, but he is working for Rupert Murdoch.\n\nThe upcoming debate promises to be equally challenging, with Wallace, who was the foil for Newt Gingrich's first public haranguing of a debate moderator in 2015, likely to be similarly unforgiving. Candidates who expect a free ride from Wallace will quickly become debate roadkill.",
    " Title: Trump's Challenges in 2020 Election: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nThe question for Donald Trump is not whether he can beat Joe Biden, but whether he can beat Joe Biden, an epidemic, a recession, and a few swing voters who may have grown weary of Trump's unpredictable leadership.\n\nRepublicans may cheer as Trump attacks Biden, labeling him as senile, fragile, weak, and unsteady. However, these attacks may not be enough to secure a victory, as Democrats and independents are the real challenges.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won critical states like Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, but he failed to secure 50% of the vote in any of these states. Trump's margin of error is slim.\n\nBiden's remarkable comeback saw him outmaneuver every significant opponent, leaving only Bernie Sanders. Biden's political machine, powerful and resilient, will be even more formidable once the Sanders faction remembers its disdain for Trump over the Democratic National Committee.\n\nBiden is running strong among African Americans, new Democratic voters, and is expected to garner support from Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, and even Bernie Sanders himself, along with Michael Bloomberg's financial backing.\n\nTrump's boasts of high share prices and low unemployment ring hollow in the face of the stock market's 20% plunge due to the coronavirus outbreak and the administration's incompetent response. Trump's inability to provide accurate information, such as the insurance companies not waiving copays for coronavirus treatment or the suspension of all air travel from Europe, undermines his credibility.\n\nEconomic growth, already falling short of Trump's promised 3% rate, is now being affected by disruptions in worldwide supply chains and declines in travel, trade, and tourism. As of March 11, Trump's national disapproval rating, according to the right-leaning Rasmussen poll, stands at 52%, compared to 47% approval.\n\nThe coronavirus presents a new kind of political challenge for Trump, one he cannot bully or buy off. It is a test of his executive competence, and so far, he has been found wanting. If the economic contraction becomes severe, Trump will need a more convincing response than his current \"The buck stops elsewhere.\"\n\nKevin D. Williamson, author of \"The Smallest Minority: Independent Thinking in the Age of Mob Politics,\" offers a sobering assessment of Trump's current political situation.",
    " Title: The Perfect Travel Companions: The Unique Qualities of Reindeer that Make Them Ideal for Santa's Sleigh\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the beloved tale of A Visit from St. Nicholas, reindeer have been immortalized as Santa Claus' trusted sleigh pullers. This choice was not a mere whim, but a strategic decision based on the unique qualities that reindeer possess, making them the ideal candidates for the job.\n\nFrom their Arctic habitat, reindeer have evolved features that enable them to thrive in harsh, icy environments. One such feature is their adaptable hooves. During colder weather, the pads on their feet shrink, revealing the rim of their hooves, providing the necessary traction and grip to navigate slippery ground. In warmer months, the pads on their feet expand and soften, offering a strong grip on wet, melting snow. Additionally, their hooves are shaped like shovels, allowing them to dig through snow to access food sources beneath.\n\nReindeer's adaptable hooves, combined with their speed and stamina, make them reliable sleigh companions. They can trot at 25 miles per hour and double their speed if necessary, making a swift escape from predators. They have also been recorded traveling 500 air miles in six weeks across varied terrain.\n\nAnother unique quality of reindeer is their ability to swim. Despite their bulky appearance, reindeer are strong swimmers, keeping pace at 4 miles per hour in wide bodies of water during their migratory periods.\n\nReindeer also possess an advantageous trait in their lack of an internal body clock. This means they do not release melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep patterns in response to light and dark cycles. Without an internal body clock, reindeer can adapt to their own needs, avoiding the risk of insufficient sleep in the summer and not enough daylight hours to eat during the winter. This trait is particularly useful for their global travels, as it prevents them from experiencing jet lag.\n\nWith their adaptable hooves, speed, and ability to avoid jet lag, reindeer are the perfect choice as a Christmas travel companion. Their unique qualities make them well-equipped to navigate the challenges of Santa's global journey, ensuring a smooth and efficient delivery of presents to children around the world.",
    " Title: Trump Administration's Imminent Changes to Obamacare: A Look at the Challenges Ahead\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Donald Trump prepares to assume office, the future of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, is under scrutiny. The Republican-controlled Congress and the incoming administration have vowed to repeal and replace the healthcare legislation, a promise that has been a cornerstone of the GOP's campaign since its inception in 2010.\n\nSince its enactment, Obamacare has faced relentless criticism from the Republican establishment. However, with a Republican president and a Congress, the repeal of the legislation now seems imminent. During his campaign, Trump consistently pledged to repeal Obamacare, a promise that still stands on the Trump-Pence campaign website.\n\nIn the aftermath of his election, Trump has softened his rhetoric, indicating a desire to revise rather than outright repeal the legislation. Nevertheless, the Affordable Care Act, born amidst political upheaval, is likely to undergo significant changes.\n\nThe revamping of Obamacare, however, could present significant risks for the Trump administration. The Republican party will be tasked with overhauling the $3 trillion U.S. health-care system, a system they have long criticized. If the insurance market is disrupted, and millions of Americans lose coverage, the blame will fall squarely on the Republicans.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, who faced similar challenges in implementing Obamacare, has already issued a word of caution. \"I think that's not going to be unique to me,\" Obama warned. \"I think the American people will respond that way. I think on a lot of issues, what you're going to see is, now comes the hard part. Now is governance.\"\n\nIn the weeks following the election, GOP leaders and the president-elect have been gearing up to dismantle Obamacare. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asserted that repealing Obamacare is \"pretty high\" on the Republican agenda. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan echoed this sentiment, stating that Obamacare is failing and needs to be replaced quickly. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, suggested that he might convene a \"special session\" on Inauguration Day to discuss health-care reform.\n\nAs the Trump administration prepares to take office, the future of Obamacare hangs in the balance. The challenges ahead are significant, and the consequences of any changes could be far-reaching.",
    " Title: Internal Struggles Emerge in GOP as Establishment and Tea Party Wings Clash\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, the Republican Party is currently grappling with an internal power struggle between its establishment and the Tea Party wing. This conflict, reminiscent of the early 20th century when Theodore Roosevelt failed to save the GOP from its fringe elements, is causing a rift within the party, as reported by various news outlets such as the New York Daily News, Washington Post, Politico, and Time.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has been vocal in his criticism of conservative political action groups like FreedomWorks and Heritage Action, which have been at odds with the compromise budget agreement between Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington). Boehner's harsh words towards these groups, which he believes are misleading their followers and pushing members into unpopular positions, mark a departure from his previous reluctance to confront the Tea Party wing.\n\nThe recent budget deal saw 169 Republicans joining Democrats in its approval, a significant shift from the political absolutism encouraged by the professional right that has long been a source of gridlock in Congress. This move towards compromise has been hailed by some as a sign of political maturity from Boehner, but it has also sparked a backlash from the right as the 2014 mid-term elections approach.\n\nThe 2014 mid-terms could prove challenging for the Republicans, with eight of the 12 GOP incumbent Senators seeking re-election facing primary challenges. This includes the top two Senate Republicans \u2013 Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Minority Whip John Cornyn of Texas. McConnell is being challenged by businessman Matt Bevin, who accuses the five-term incumbent of not being conservative enough.\n\nMcConnell, who has to contend with this challenge, claims to be a supporter of the Tea Party movement. However, he has criticized the Senate Conservatives Fund, which backs Bevin and was instrumental in the government shutdown over Obamacare, for damaging the Republican brand.\n\nThe Senate Conservatives Fund's actions, according to McConnell, mislead donors into believing the reason for the party's inability to achieve desired outcomes is due to insufficient commitment from Republicans, rather than a Democratic Senate and presidency.\n\nThomas Patterson, writing in Politico magazine, warns of a looming showdown between the Tea Party-driven right wing and the center-right faction of the Republican Party. He suggests that if the reactionary wing prevails and fails to accommodate the party's moderates, the Republican Party could become the 21st century's permanent minority party, much like the Republican Party of a century ago.\n\nThis internal conflict within the Republican Party is a significant development in American politics, as the party grapples with finding a balance between its conservative and moderate factions. The outcome of this struggle could shape the political landscape for years to come.",

According to a tally by Bloomberg, the members of the senior staff and cabinet are estimated to be worth $12 billion. The Friday filings have added voluminous detail to this top-line figure.\n\nFor instance, the White House Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, earned at least $1.18 million, with nearly half of this income coming from the Republican National Committee, which he formerly led. His assets totaled between $604,008 and at least $1.26 million.\n\nSean Spicer, the White House press secretary, commented on the financial disclosures, stating, \"I think one of the really interesting things that people are going to see today \u2014 and I think it's something that should be celebrated \u2014 is that the president has brought a lot of people into this administration, and this White House in particular, who have been very blessed and very successful.\" He added, \"These officials have given up a lot to come into government by setting aside a lot of assets.\"\n\nJared Kushner, the President's son-in-law and a key advisor, was the chief executive of Kushner Companies, a family-run real estate investment firm with holdings across the country. This growing business has been involved in at least $7 billion of acquisitions over the past decade.\n\nLate Friday, the White House released details of the plan devised by Kushner's advisers to avoid conflicts of interest between his government role and the wide-ranging business empire he ran with his father. The business depends on foreign investment from undisclosed sources, as well as billions of dollars in loans from the world's biggest financial services firms.\n\nAlthough Kushner has stepped down from his management positions at the more than 200 entities that operated aspects of the family real estate business, he will remain a beneficiary of a vast majority of the business he ran for the past decade, through a series of trusts that already owned the various real estate companies.\n\nThe plan laid out on Friday \"is not sufficient,\" said Larry Noble, a former general counsel and chief ethics officer for the Federal Election Commission. \"While removing himself from the management of the businesses is an important step, he is still financially benefiting from how the businesses do. This presents potential for a conflict of interest. Given his level in the White House and broad portfolio, it's hard to see how he will recuse himself from everything that may impact his financial interest.\"\n\nWhile the filing discloses Kushner's personal lenders, it does not provide information on his business partners or lenders to his projects. The disclosures have sparked discussions about potential conflicts of interest and the need for further measures to ensure transparency and avoid any perceived or actual conflicts.",
    " Title: Obama Proposes $100 Million for Human Brain Research Initiative\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at advancing scientific research and understanding of the human brain, President Obama on Tuesday announced a proposed $100 million investment in a new program that could lead to breakthroughs in treating conditions such as autism, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury.\n\nAddressing scientists and researchers at the White House, Mr. Obama emphasized the need to unlock the mystery of the human brain, stating, \"As humans, we can identify galaxies light-years away, we can study particles smaller than an atom, but we still haven't unlocked the mystery of the 3 pounds of matter that sits between our ears.\"\n\nThe proposed funding, to be included in Mr. Obama's federal budget next week, will boost studies into brain function, with funds coming from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Defense Department, and the National Science Foundation. The president underscored the importance of scientific research, stating, \"Ideas are what power our economy. It's so important that we think about basic research generally as a driver of growth.\"\n\nDespite the ongoing \"sequester\" budget cuts that took effect in March, Mr. Obama emphasized the need to continue investing in research, stating, \"We can't afford to cut back on scientific research.\" He added, \"We can't afford to miss these opportunities while the rest of the world races ahead.\"\n\nThe White House has named the program the Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, a continuation of Mr. Obama's call for more investment in research and development during his State of the Union address.\n\nThe NIH will establish a working group co-chaired by Dr. Cornelia Bargmann of Rockefeller University and Dr. William Newsome of Stanford University to define scientific goals for the NIH's investment and develop a multiyear scientific plan for achieving these goals.\n\nMr. Obama acknowledged the risks associated with government-funded research projects, stating, \"But when they do, they change our lives in ways that we could never have imagined.\" He pointed to the Internet and computer chips as examples of successful government-funded research.\n\nThe president expressed optimism about the potential benefits of the BRAIN Initiative, stating, \"Imagine if we could reverse traumatic brain injury or [post-traumatic stress disorders] for our veterans who are coming home. What if computers could respond to our thoughts, or our language barriers could come tumbling down?\"\n\nHe also highlighted the potential medical benefits of the initiative, stating, \"We're still unable to cure diseases like Alzheimer's or autism, or fully reverse the effects of a stroke. The BRAIN Initiative will change that by giving scientists the tools they need to get a dynamic picture of the brain in action and better understand how we think and how we learn and remember. That knowledge could be, will be, transformative.\"",
    " Title: Congress Struggles to Reach Border Wall Funding Agreement, Leaving Government Funding in Limbo\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tense standoff, members of Congress have yet to reach an agreement on border wall funding, leading to a potential government shutdown as the deadline for passing the final 25 percent of fiscal 2019 funding approaches. The impasse comes after Democrats rejected a new Republican offer for $1.6 billion in border wall funding, with President Trump backing off his demand for $5 billion from Congress.\n\nThe White House has announced that they will seek alternative funding sources for the border wall, with Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders ordering all departments and agencies to look for legally available cash to redirect towards the border wall. However, this retreat led to a rejection of the Republican offer by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, who stated that the proposed deal would not pass either chamber.\n\nWith the deadline for passing the final government funding looming on Friday, lawmakers are looking to a stopgap bill, or \"continuing resolution,\" to keep government functions running into January. Departments such as Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, Justice, Treasury, and Homeland Security are among those affected.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed optimism that they will avoid a shutdown, blaming House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for the failure of Tuesday's deal. Pelosi, however, countered that the deal offered by McConnell included not only $1.6 billion in border wall funding, but also a $1 billion \"slush fund\" that the president could use for his immigration policies.\n\nAs the border wall spending issue seems to be a train wreck in the making, all sides are powerless to avoid it, with President Trump repeatedly vowing to force a government shutdown if he doesn't get his $5 billion demand. The White House maintains that any reprogramming of funds would require congressional approval, a tough sell according to Pelosi and Schumer.\n\nWhile the border funding has been the major public sticking point, lawmakers have also yet to resolve other matters in the spending battle, such as funding for ICE detention and enforcement, language tied to the new citizenship question in the 2020 Census, and potential anti-Israel \"Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions\" (BDS) legislation.\n\nAs the situation remains uncertain, the Senate could potentially pass a short-term funding bill and adjourn for Christmas as early as Thursday, although this seems unlikely according to Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska. House lawmakers have been out of town since last week, with the next scheduled votes not scheduled until Wednesday evening, two days before the funding deadline.",
    " Title: Critics Question Clinton's Accusations Against Gabbard and Her Presidential Candidacy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing 2020 Democratic primary race has seen a new development as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has criticized Tulsi Gabbard, a fellow Democratic candidate, for her foreign policy views and potential ties to Russia. However, the criticism has sparked controversy, with some arguing that Clinton's accusations are unsubstantiated and could potentially be harmful to the democratic process.\n\nClinton's accusation that Gabbard is a tool of the Russians was met with skepticism, as no evidence was provided to support this assertion. Van Jones, an Obama administration official and current CNN commentator, called Clinton's comments \"disinformation\" on the network Friday. \"I do not want someone of her stature to legitimate these attacks against anybody,\" Jones said. \"If you've got real evidence, come forward with it. But if you're just going to smear people casually on podcasts, you are playing right into the Russians' hands.\"\n\nGabbard's foreign policy views, such as her isolationist stance and support for drug decriminalization, have drawn praise from various political groups, including alt-right internet stars, white nationalists, libertarian activists, and some of the biggest boosters of President Trump. However, Gabbard's ties to Russia and her apparent alignment with Russian and Syrian talking points have raised concerns among some Democrats.\n\nThe acting director of national intelligence has noted that the very fact that a Russia misinformation campaign is in the public discourse hampers the democratic process by damaging public trust. An independent analysis of the Russian news media found that RT, the Kremlin-backed news agency, mentioned Gabbard frequently for a candidate polling in single digits.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Gabbard's candidacy, some argue that she represents viewpoints that draw support from an array of people in the United States as well as abroad. However, her stance on foreign policy, particularly her skepticism towards American interventionism, has raised eyebrows and concerns among some Democrats.\n\nThe debate over Gabbard's candidacy and potential ties to Russia is a complex issue that highlights the ongoing concerns about foreign interference in American politics. As the 2020 election approaches, the Democratic National Committee and the public will be closely watching developments in this regard.",
    " Title: Senate Judiciary Chairman Grants Additional Extension for Christine Blasey Ford to Decide on Testifying\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Saturday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) granted an additional extension for attorney Debra S. Katz and her client, Professor Christine Blasey Ford, to decide on whether they will testify in the ongoing sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nInitially, Professor Ford and her counsel had until 10:00 AM on Friday to submit requests for testimony, including specific details such as date and time. However, this deadline passed without a response. In response to Senator Grassley's Friday evening deadline, Katz declined to comply and instead requested an additional day.\n\nSenator Grassley accused Katz of setting an \"arbitrary\" deadline and displayed a \"cavalier\" treatment towards a sexual assault survivor. In a series of tweets, he implored Professor Ford to let the Senate Judiciary Committee know if she was willing to testify or not.\n\nSenator Grassley tweeted, \"Come to us or we come to you,\" and further stated, \"I want to hear her.\" After nearly two hours of no definitive response to Katz's latest request, Senator Grassley tweeted his response, saying, \"I want to hear her\" and that he had decided to grant another extension.\n\nIn a tweet, Senator Grassley expressed his frustration, stating, \"With all the extensions we give Dr. Ford to decide if she still wants to testify to the Senate, I feel like I'm playing second trombone in the judiciary orchestra, and Schumer is the conductor.\"\n\nUnder this framework, Katz and Professor Ford now have until 10:00 PM tonight to decide if they are willing to testify. The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on Monday if Professor Ford decides to testify. The outcome of this decision could potentially impact the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.",
    " Title: Marco Rubio Announces 2016 Presidential Bid: A Closer Look at the Florida Senator's Campaign\n\nIn the political landscape of 2016, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has officially entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination. With a strong fundraising team and significant support from influential Republican donors, Rubio is positioning himself as a formidable contender in the upcoming election.\n\nRubio's campaign has secured the services of Anna Rogers, the finance director for American Crossroads, a political advocacy group led by Karl Rove. Rogers will spearhead the fundraising efforts, aiming to raise at least $50 million for the campaign. Notably, Rubio is one of only four potential GOP candidates invited to a gathering hosted by the influential Koch brothers, with Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush not making the list.\n\nRubio's potential to garner a larger share of the Latino vote in the general election is a significant advantage, given the historical challenges the GOP has faced in this demographic. His stance on immigration, while evolving, has included support for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, a position that could resonate with the Latino community.\n\nFlorida, a key swing state, stands as the most significant battleground in the presidential race. The state's decisive role was evident in the 2000 election, where a narrow margin of votes in Florida tipped the balance in favor of George W. Bush over Al Gore.\n\nWhile the GOP field is expected to be crowded, only two other candidates have officially announced their bids: Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul. The Washington Post has dubbed Rubio as the \"crown prince\" of the Tea Party movement, and he has earned perfect 100 ratings from the American Conservative Union.\n\nRubio has been touring the country to promote his book, \"American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone,\" which outlines his proposals for addressing economic security and income inequality. His rhetorical skills have been praised, and he was chosen to deliver the official Republican response to President Barack Obama's 2013 State of the Union address.\n\nBefore his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Rubio served four terms in the Florida legislature, holding positions such as speaker of the House, majority leader, and majority whip. Those who question Rubio's readiness for the presidency after just one term in the Senate might recall that President Obama had been in the Senate for barely two years when he announced his successful run for president.\n\nAs the 2016 race unfolds, Marco Rubio's campaign promises a fresh approach to economic opportunity and a renewed focus on the American Dream. With his strong fundraising team, significant donor support, and a growing list of policy proposals, Rubio is poised to make a significant impact in the upcoming election.",
    " Title: Gun Sales Surge Amidst President Obama's Proposed Gun Control Measures and Executive Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the wake of President Obama's announced executive actions and proposed gun control measures, the firearm industry is experiencing a significant surge in sales and stock prices. On Wednesday, stocks for gun manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson Holding Co. (SWHC) and Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR) rose approximately 4%. The stock for Sturm, Ruger has risen 13% in the month since the shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that left 20 children and six educators dead.\n\nRetailers specializing in guns have also seen a boost. The stock price for Cabela's (CAB) surged 6% on Wednesday and has gained 20% over the last month. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS, Fortune 500) notched up slightly, and has gained 6% over the month.\n\nThe fear of potential future bans on certain firearms, including assault rifles, has prompted gun enthusiasts to stock up on weapons. Rommel Dionisio, gun industry analyst for Wedbush Securities, stated, \"Consumers are flocking to stores to purchase certain types of firearms, including assault rifles, in fears of some type of ban going forward.\"\n\nThis week, nearly 60,000 people will attend the annual SHOT Show in Las Vegas, one of the largest firearm trade shows in the country. Attendees are discussing the president's gun control proposals, with many expressing concerns about potential bans, stricter background checks, and school security.\n\nAt the show, attendees are debating the effectiveness of an assault rifle ban, with some arguing that banning one type of gun will not help prevent mass shootings, as the Columbine shootings were committed with handguns and shotguns. They also question the responsibility of gun owners, citing the Newtown, Conn., shooter's mother, who owned the guns and left them where her son could access them.\n\nRegarding background checks, attendees believe stricter evaluations of potential gun owners are reasonable, with a call for increased mental health checks. They acknowledge the difficulty in determining who may commit acts of violence, but stress the importance of being more diligent.\n\nIn terms of school security, attendees advocate for more security, comparing it to security at sporting events and federal buildings. They argue that these individuals who commit mass shootings are not going to places with security, and that \"Gun Free Zones\" at schools are not effective.\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA), which has seen a significant increase in members following the Newtown tragedy, released the following statement in response to President Obama's calls for more gun control:\n\n\"The National Rifle Association of America is taking strong exception to the comments made by the President today regarding firearms, the Second Amendment, and the role of the National Rifle Association of America and the millions of law-abiding gun owners in this country. The President's remarks demonstrate an elitist, anti-gun attitude that is out of touch with the hard-working, patriotic Americans who are the backbone of our country. The President's proposals would not have prevented the tragedies in Newtown, Aurora, or any of the numerous other mass shootings that have occurred in our country. Rather, these proposals would only serve to burden law-abiding citizens' Second Amendment rights, while doing nothing to stop criminals or those with evil intent.\"\n\nThe NRA's statement underscores the ongoing debate surrounding gun control and the Second Amendment, as President Obama continues to push for stricter gun control measures in response to recent mass shootings.",
    " Title: U.S. Income and Poverty Rates Show Mixed Progress in 2015, Remain Below Pre-Recession Levels\n\nArticle:\n\nThe latest report from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals a significant improvement in income and poverty rates in 2015, marking the first increase in eight years. However, the data shows that many measures of income and poverty in 2015 remain below historical averages.\n\nThe median household income climbed by 5.2% to $56,516, marking one of the biggest increases in recent years. Yet, this figure is still below the median income prior to the recession and the all-time peak reached in 1999. The poverty rate also decreased to 13.5%, the biggest improvement in recent years, but remains higher than before the recession and above the poverty rates seen in the 1970s and in the year 2000.\n\nThe poverty rate among those aged 65 and older is only slightly higher than its record lows. However, the poverty rate among children and working-age people has yet to recover significantly. Among working-age people, poverty is about four percentage points higher than in 2000. Among children, it's about five percentage points higher.\n\nPoverty rates have improved for whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in recent years, but none have poverty rates that have returned to their record lows. While 13.5% of Americans live below the poverty line, an additional 18% have incomes only somewhat higher. This means that a family earning 25% above the poverty line has about $23,500 to support three people, a figure that could still indicate economic difficulties, especially in areas with a high cost of living.\n\nIncome inequality continues to be a significant issue, with the top 20% of households earning a larger share of income compared to households in the middle of the income distribution. The incomes of households at the 80th, 90th, and 95th percentile have never been higher.\n\nEducation levels also play a significant role in income disparities. The median household led by someone with a master's degree earns $7,655 more per year than in 1991. Those with some college but no degree earn $7,768 less, and those with a high-school diploma but no further education earn $6,316 less.\n\nThe median Asian family earns $14,000 more than the median white family, which earns nearly $18,000 more than the median Hispanic family, which in turn earns about $8,000 more than the median black family.\n\nWhile the improvement in income and poverty rates in 2015 is a positive development, the data suggests that there is still a significant way to go before the U.S. economy returns to pre-recession levels of income and poverty.",
    " Title: FBI to Conduct Limited One-Week Review of Brett Kavanaugh's Background Amid Sexual Assault Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been authorized by President Donald Trump to conduct a limited one-week review of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's background, following allegations of sexual assault leveled by high school acquaintance Christine Blasey Ford. This move comes after a contentious Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that failed to reconcile the conflicting accounts of Ford and Kavanaugh.\n\nThe FBI's investigation will likely focus on Ford's allegations that Kavanaugh assaulted her at a house party in the Washington, D.C. suburbs in 1982. Among the first witnesses to be contacted by investigators is Kavanaugh's high school friend, Mark Judge, who Ford claims was in the room during the alleged incident.\n\nIn her testimony, Ford identified two other individuals who were allegedly present at the party, P.J. Smyth and Leland Ingham Keyser. Both have issued statements indicating they have no recollection of the party. Former FBI agent Jim Davis, who participated in at least 50 such background inquiries, stated that all individuals identified as being present at the party, as well as those Ford told of the incident, would likely be interviewed.\n\nPrior to Thursday's hearing, Ford's attorneys provided the Senate committee with sworn declarations from four people, including Ford's husband, who said that Ford had shared details of the incident and Kavanaugh's alleged involvement with them. Ford's husband, Russell Ford, stated that he first learned of his wife's experience with sexual assault \"around the time we got married.\" However, he said Ford did not share details of the incident until a couple's therapy session in 2012.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the scope of the FBI's inquiry will allow for the review of other allegations leveled by former Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, who claimed that Kavanaugh exposed himself at a drunken party during the 1983-84 academic year, or by Julie Swetnick, who has alleged that in the 1980s she witnessed Kavanaugh and Judge attempt to ply teenage girls with alcohol at wild parties where girls were sexually abused.\n\nRay Mey, a former FBI agent who conducted dozens of background checks during his tenure at the bureau, stated that \"the FBI has more than enough resources to do this in a week.\" However, he expressed concern that \"nobody comes out of this looking good, including the FBI.\" If the FBI discovers derogatory information, Mey warned that the FBI risks invoking the wrath of the president, who has accused the bureau of attempting to sabotage his administration as part of its inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. If the FBI does not find anything, Mey said, the other side will claim it's a cover-up.",
    " Title: University Researcher Jailed for Bringing Licensed Firearm to Office in Gun-Controlled Chicago\n\nArticle:\n\nA 55-year-old researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago was jailed this week for bringing a licensed, unloaded handgun to her office, sparking a debate over gun control laws in the city. The woman, who also holds an \"Illinois Firearm Owners Registration Card,\" told Chicago police that she had brought the handgun, recently purchased for home defense, to her workplace because she did not want to leave it at her residence while a work crew was there doing a renovation project.\n\nChicago, known for its strict gun laws, considers carrying a weapon, even without ammunition, a serious offense. A co-worker spotted the pistol case and called police who came and arrested the information specialist from her workplace. The Chicago Tribune reports that the woman was held on $25,000 bond pending trial and placed on leave by the university.\n\nMeanwhile, Chicago Police were dealing with another crime on the city's West Side, where an unidentified male was found stabbed to death in an alleyway, marking the 50th murder in the city this year. The victim was later identified as a 22-year-old from across town in Calumet City, but given the low rate at which the city's 535 murders last year were solved, it looks unlikely that police will soon identify the perpetrator.\n\nPresident Obama is currently in Chicago, making another pitch for his \"cradle to career\" educational initiatives. However, the president will likely have to address the city's escalating murder rate during his stay.\n\nWhile Chicago's murder rate is not as high as murder-ridden cities like New Orleans or Detroit, the increase in murders is alarming for locals. While murder rates in the nation continue to decline, Chicago has seen sharp increases. While murder rates in New York dropped to an all-time low last year, Chicago was approaching numbers not seen since the crack wars of the early 1990s.\n\nChicago's Mayor, Rahm Emanuel, a former congressman, a former chief of staff to Obama, and a potential future presidential contender, believes he knows why Chicago is unraveling while New York is stabilizing. Emanuel has gone to war on guns, taking up the cause with new vigor following the mass shooting in Connecticut last year.\n\nHowever, as the jailed University of Illinois at Chicago researcher can attest, the gun laws are already pretty strict. The police did not discover the mix-up and tell her to take her gun home; they took her to jail for having a licensed, registered weapon that without ammunition was only about as deadly as a desktop stapler.\n\nThe woman's ignorance of the city's gun laws, while understandable, has led to her arrest. Emanuel urgently needs to stem the crime wave in his city. His political future and the city's economic fate depend on erasing the growing perception of Chicago returning to its most lawless days, the era of Cabrini-Green and the crack wars. And at the very least, he needs to demonstrate that it is gun manufacturers who are more to blame than he, whose mayoralty has coincided with the crime wave.\n\nThe question for President Obama is whether he can make the case that a national gun ban would be effective in reducing murder rates given the results in Chicago. As Chris Stirewalt, digital politics editor for \u2588\u2588\u2588, points out, spending $7 billion a year on Head Start does not make any difference after the third grade, and Obama wants to double down to make it universal. This, according to Stirewalt, is a definition of a liberal.",
    " Title: House Democrats Urge Immediate Release of Non-Violent Immigrants in Detention to Prevent COVID-19 Spread\n\nTwo leading House Democrats, Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), have called on the Department of Homeland Security to immediately release non-violent immigrants in U.S. custody, citing concerns over the rapid spread of coronavirus in overcrowded immigrant detention facilities.\n\nIn a letter addressed to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and acting ICE Director Matthew Albence on Tuesday, the lawmakers urged the department to take swift action to decrease the detainee population to prevent further spread of the disease.\n\nThe lawmakers pointed to recent reports of detainees and staff testing positive at multiple detention centers, the high risk of further outbreaks in the near future, and the lack of adequate medical staff and equipment. They called for the immediate release of non-violent detainees, prioritizing those who are at higher risk for complications from coronavirus.\n\nAccording to Maloney and Raskin, 19 immigrants detained at six detention centers across the U.S. have so far contracted COVID-19, along with seven facility staff members. As of the end of March, more than 35,000 immigrants are being detained across the United States, according to Roll Call.\n\nICE has already released at least 160 immigrants from detention who were at risk of contracting COVID-19, and the agency has identified 600 others who are at higher risk for contracting the virus, according to Roll Call. However, immigrant releases will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the agency said.\n\n\"Due to the unprecedented nature of COVID-19, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is reviewing cases of individuals in detention who may be vulnerable to the virus,\" an ICE spokesperson told Roll Call. \"Utilizing CDC guidance along with the advice of medical professionals, ICE may place individuals in a number of alternatives to detention options.\"",

CNN is part of Turner Broadcasting, which is owned by Time Warner.\n\nReports suggested that the Department of Justice (DOJ) was mandating the sale, but the Justice Department has since denied these claims. AT&T was also rumored to have offered to part with CNN to secure the merger, but the company's CEO has publicly stated that selling CNN is not an option.\n\nThe corporate negotiations have political undertones due to Trump's frequent criticism of CNN as \"fake news.\" Some critics have alleged that Trump could be seeking to retaliate against the network by interfering in a Justice Department decision regarding the merger.\n\nHowever, the head of the DOJ's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, has denied any White House involvement in the transaction. \"I have never been instructed by the White House on this or any other transaction under review by the antitrust division,\" Delrahim said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nWhite House spokesman Raj Shah also confirmed that Trump had not been involved in the decision-making process. \"The president did not speak with the attorney general about this matter, and no White House official was authorized to speak with the Department of Justice on this matter,\" Shah said.\n\nTrump reiterated his non-involvement in the matter on Saturday. \"Well, I didn't make that decision \u2014 it was made by a man who's a very respected person, a very very respected person,\" Trump said. \"That probably ends up being litigation; maybe not. We'll see how it all plays out.\"\n\nTrump had previously vowed on the campaign trail last year to block the merger, citing concerns over the concentration of power in the hands of a few. The future of the merger and the fate of CNN remain uncertain as the negotiations continue.",
    " Title: IRS Pays Millions in Bonuses to Employees with Disciplinary Issues, Including Those Owing Back Taxes\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a revelation that has sparked outrage among taxpayers, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has paid out more than $2.8 million in bonuses to employees with recent disciplinary problems, including over $1 million to workers who owed back taxes. The disclosure was made by J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, in a report released on Tuesday.\n\nThe report states that more than 2,800 IRS employees received bonuses despite facing disciplinary action in the previous year, with 1,150 of these employees owing back taxes. The bonuses were awarded from October 2010 through December 2012.\n\nGeorge's report indicates that the bonus program does not violate federal regulations, but it is inconsistent with the IRS's mission to enforce tax laws. This disclosure comes at a time when the IRS is already under scrutiny for its handling of conservative groups and its role in the high-profile targeting scandal.\n\nThe report has sparked criticism from various quarters, with conservative commentator Mary Katharine Ham suggesting that there should be a law to prevent the IRS from giving out bonuses to employees who fail to pay their own taxes. Ham's comment underscores the public's growing suspicion of the IRS and the perceived inconsistency between the agency's role in collecting taxes and its own tax compliance record.\n\nWhether this public embarrassment will lead to reforms within the IRS remains to be seen. The agency has a history of bureaucratic inertia, and it remains to be seen whether this latest revelation will be enough to prompt meaningful change.",
    " Title: Resignation of Rep. Patrick Meehan and Rep. Blake Farenthold Ends Ethics Committee Investigations, Leaves Accountability Questions Unanswered\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The resignations of Rep. Patrick Meehan and Rep. Blake Farenthold this month have ended ethics committee investigations into allegations of sexual harassment and the use of taxpayer funds for settlements. However, the House Ethics Committee's lack of jurisdiction over lawmakers once they leave office means that the panel will close its investigation, leaving questions about accountability unanswered.\n\nMeehan, a Republican, announced his immediate resignation on Friday, while Farenthold, also a Republican, resigned on April 6. Both lawmakers have promised to repay the taxpayer-funded settlements, but there is no mechanism to ensure they make good on that pledge.\n\nStephen Spaulding, chief of strategy for Common Cause, a nonprofit group that advocates for strong ethics and campaign finance requirements, said, \"When members resign, they can evade accountability.\" He added, \"Voters don't get the answers that they would otherwise get... and (lawmakers) are able to really put a cloak over whatever violations they may have committed.\"\n\nThe House voted earlier this year to change its sexual harassment policies, passing a bill in February that would require members of Congress to pay out of their own pockets for any sexual harassment settlements even after they leave office. The bill included a bevy of other reforms aimed at improving the way Congress handles sexual harassment cases and came in the wake of a national wave of sexual harassment scandals.\n\nHowever, that measure has stalled in the Senate. Democrats pushed to include the House-passed legislation in a broad spending bill that cleared Congress earlier this year, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., reportedly objected. A spokesman for McConnell said the GOP leader \"supports members being personally, financially liable for sexual misconduct in which they have engaged.\"\n\nSens. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, said they are working on a compromise proposal and hope to release it in the coming weeks.\n\nEven if lawmakers do reach an agreement, it would not address the ability of lawmakers to keep ethics committee findings under wraps by resigning. Spaulding said the process is so slow that it often gives lawmakers plenty of time to make an exit.\n\nJan Baran, a Washington attorney who specializes in federal ethics matters, said some lawmakers only resign if they see \"the handwriting on the wall.\" He noted that only if a lawmaker violated a federal law, rather than just a congressional rule, will the matter follow him or her out the door.\n\nBaran cited the case of ex-Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., who faced allegations that his parents paid $96,000 to his ex-mistress and her family. He said it was a gift but the Senate Ethics Committee said it was an excessive political contribution that should have been disclosed on Ensign's campaign filings.\n\n\"The committee was recommending a public investigation that would have led to censure or expulsion,\" Baran recalled. \"Seeing the handwriting on the wall, the senator resigned.\"\n\nEnsign didn't escape without some penalty. He eventually paid $54,000 in civil penalties to the Federal Election Commission to settle a parallel case.",
    " Title: Celebrities Rally Behind Elizabeth Warren in Progressive Movement\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of celebrities and influencers recently gathered in a Chinatown loft to discuss their support for Senator Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary. The event, dubbed \"Artists for Warren,\" was attended by approximately 150 cultural tastemakers who aim to create enough buzz to encourage Warren to challenge Hillary Clinton, the presumptive nominee.\n\nThe gathering took place in the loft of filmmakers Julie Pacino and Jennifer DeLia, known for their association with progressive populism. The event was set to feature an exclusive video message from actor Mark Ruffalo, but technical issues prevented its screening. Ruffalo, who is currently filming a movie in London, expressed his support for Warren, stating, \"If she primaries and doesn't win the primary, she will at least push the conversation more toward the progressive values that we all share.\"\n\nRuffalo, who has played a contractor in a movie about a lesbian couple and the Hulk, is one of several celebrities voicing their support for Warren. Vanity Fair, The New York Times, and David Frum of The Atlantic have also published articles advocating for Warren's candidacy.\n\nThe potential match-up between Warren and Clinton has sparked interest, with celebrities such as Edward Norton, Susan Sarandon, Natasha Lyonne, Olivia Wilde, and Kim Gordon expressing their support for Warren. Ross Baker, a political-science professor at Rutgers University, told Vanity Fair that there is a segment of the Democratic left that has not forgiven the Clintons for their role in welfare reform.\n\nAs the primary season approaches, the political landscape is shaping up to be an exciting spectacle, with the potential for a progressive vs. establishment showdown. The outcome of this battle could significantly influence the direction of the Democratic Party and the nation as a whole.",
    " Title: Polls Suggest Partisan Shift in Perceptions of Russia Election Interference and James Comey\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent poll by YouGov, a leading global polling organization, has revealed a significant shift in public perception regarding the alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and the role of former FBI Director James Comey.\n\nThe poll, published last week, found that numerous authorities, including former President Barack Obama, James Clapper, James Comey, and Mike Rogers, have consistently denied any evidence of Russian manipulation of vote tallies to elect Donald Trump. Despite this, Democrats are more inclined to believe the election was rigged now than they were previously.\n\nIn response to the question about Russian tampering with vote tallies, a majority of Democrats now believe it to be true, while Republicans remain skeptical. This shift in belief, despite a lack of concrete evidence, has been termed as \"motivated reasoning\" by some observers.\n\nAnother intriguing finding from the poll is the change in public opinion about James Comey, who was criticized by the left for his actions during the 2016 election. Despite this, Democrats now view Comey favorably, with 42% approving and 29% disapproving, while Republicans disfavor him, with 18% approving and 57% disapproving.\n\nThis shift in perception seems to be largely driven by partisan affiliation, as both the YouGov and Harvard-Harris polls show Comey in positive territory among Democrats. The Harvard-Harris poll, conducted between May 17 and 20, has Comey at 37% approval and 27% disapproval among Democrats, a significant increase from last month's 17% approval and 36% disapproval.\n\nHowever, the YouGov poll, conducted between May 13 and 16, predates the news about Comey's memo, suggesting that partisan tribalism may be a significant factor in these shifting perceptions.",
    " Title: Clinton Positions Women's Issues at the Forefront of 2016 Campaign in New Hampshire\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early-voting state of New Hampshire, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the role of women's issues in her 2016 presidential campaign during a rally on Saturday. The event, titled \"Women for Hillary,\" was held outside Portsmouth Junior High School and marked the Labor Day weekend kickoff of Clinton's campaign's focus on women's rights.\n\nClinton, who won the New Hampshire primary in 2008 as the first woman to do so, has been trailing Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in recent polls. However, she addressed a crowd of approximately 1,000 supporters, sharing the stage with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a former governor and longtime supporter who officially endorsed Clinton's campaign on Saturday.\n\nClinton emphasized her commitment to women's issues, stating, \"I am a proud lifelong fighter for women's issues.\" She went on to discuss various aspects of her domestic and economic agenda, highlighting their impact on women's lives.\n\nChild care, paid family leave, equal pay, minimum wage, and corporate accountability were among the issues Clinton addressed, framing them as both women's issues and economic issues. She argued that women should not have to sacrifice their careers or financial stability when they have children or face health challenges.\n\nClinton's open and unequivocal embrace of running as a woman and women's issues is a departure from her 2008 presidential bid, during which she shied away from explicit gender-based appeals. This time around, Clinton is attacking her Republican opponents on women's issues and women's health, hoping to create a clear contrast in the general election and motivate female voters.\n\nClinton specifically called out several Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump and Dr. Ben Carson, for their positions on women's health and reproductive rights. She encouraged the New Hampshire voters, who provided a fitting audience for her full-court press on women's issues, noting the state's history of electing women to high office.\n\nIn conclusion, Clinton's speech in New Hampshire underscores her commitment to women's rights and her intention to make them a central focus of her 2016 presidential campaign. By framing her domestic and economic agenda in terms of its impact on women's lives, Clinton aims to engage and mobilize female voters in the upcoming primary and general elections.",
    " Title: Trump Announces Stepping Away from Business Operations to Focus on Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump has announced that he will be stepping away from his business operations to focus solely on his presidential duties. The announcement was made during a press conference scheduled for December 15 in New York City, where he will be joined by his children.\n\nTrump stated that he felt it was visually important, as President, to have no conflict of interest with his various businesses. Legal documents are being drafted to remove him completely from business operations, with the Presidency being his primary focus.\n\nDuring the campaign trail, Trump had previously discussed the idea of placing his business in a \"blind trust,\" a term that is not legally defined. However, he continued to involve his children and executives from the Trump Organization in his business dealings, even during supposedly diplomatic meetings where business requests were intertwined with the business of the United States.\n\nDespite his previous claims that a blind trust was unnecessary, Trump had stated, \"The law's totally on my side, meaning, the president can't have a conflict of interest.\" However, he has now decided to step away from his business operations, offering what appears to be the same inadequate plan he initially proposed.\n\nTrump's decision to step away from his business operations is a significant shift from his previous stance, where he had suggested that he could manage both his business and the presidency from the same desk. This new move is being hailed as a step towards avoiding any potential conflicts of interest.",
    " Title: The Controversy Surrounding Confederate Statues: A Historical and Ethical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding the removal and reevaluation of Confederate statues and symbols, it is crucial to approach the issue with a nuanced understanding of history and the context in which these monuments were created.\n\nThe recent wave of statue removals, graffiti, and assaults on Confederate statues has been met with resistance from some conservatives, who view these actions as part of a politically correct campaign to destroy historical artifacts. They argue that these symbols represent a part of American history and should be preserved, fearing a slippery slope that could lead to the erasure of other historical figures.\n\nHowever, the argument for the removal of these statues is rooted in their offensive nature towards black citizens, who are forced to confront symbols of chattel slavery in public spaces. The context of their creation, often as part of a push to enshrine a dishonest, prettied-up version of the Confederacy, is a significant factor in the call for their removal.\n\nThe statues, particularly those in prominent public spaces, should be transferred to museums or battlefields, not via mob action but through lawful means. The Confederate flag, as a symbol of a viciously flawed cause, should be shunned. Direct commemorations of the Confederate war dead, such as obelisks and Confederate cemeteries, should be preserved to mark the human cost of the terrible conflict.\n\nThe case of military bases named after Confederate generals is more complex, as these names have entered the American military tradition. As the source of these names becomes more widely known, it may become increasingly difficult to ask African-American soldiers to overlook them.\n\nThe statue of Robert E. Lee in Richmond, Virginia, which Governor Ralph Northam has announced will be removed, has long been a point of contention. Its 1890 unveiling was a key moment in the creation of a cult of Lee as a man of \"moral strength and moral beauty.\" This apotheosis of Lee was an element of the Lost Cause mythology that maintained the Civil War wasn't truly about slavery, but Southern states defending their legitimate prerogatives.\n\nAlexander Stephens, the vice president of the Confederacy, would have scoffed at this. In his notorious Cornerstone Speech in 1861, he stated that the new government was built on \"the great truth\" of slavery. The theory of states' rights, used by the Confederacy to justify secession, was not meant to preserve our constitutional scheme but to demolish it. The idea had been developed by former vice president John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, who believed the country had set off on an erroneous, nationalist path from the very beginning.\n\nThe South supported states' rights only to the extent that they were useful in protecting slavery. It insisted, after all, on a federal Fugitive Slave Act. Secession was a traitorous act that threatened to destroy the American nation, to create a rump republic built on slavery, and to make impossible the subsequent rise of the United States to a world power. Its leaders don't deserve to be given a place of honor in our landscape, denied to worthier men. Confederate statues should not be vandalized, but they should go.",
    " Title: Federal Judge Rules President Obama's Immigration Executive Actions Unconstitutional in Criminal Case\n\nA federal judge in Pennsylvania has ruled that President Barack Obama's recent executive actions on immigration are unconstitutional, but the decision's broader impact remains uncertain. The ruling, issued in the case of Elionardo Juarez-Escobar, a Honduran immigrant charged in federal court with unlawful re-entry after being arrested earlier this year in Pennsylvania for drunken driving, is the first-of-its-kind ruling.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Arthur Schwab, a George W. Bush appointee, argued in his 38-page opinion that Obama's unilateral legislative action violates the separation of powers provided for in the United States Constitution as well as the Take Care Clause. The judge stated that Obama's November 20, 2014 Executive Action goes beyond prosecutorial discretion because it provides for a systematic and rigid process by which a broad group of individuals will be treated differently than others based upon arbitrary classifications, rather than case-by-case examination.\n\nThe judge rejected a Justice Department legal opinion arguing that Obama's actions fall within the traditional realm of the executive's discretion about which cases to pursue and which to overlook. Schwab also quoted in detail from a series of public statements Obama made in recent years about the limits on his executive authority to make sweeping changes in immigration enforcement.\n\nJustice Department spokespersons rejected the judge's legal rationale and his decision to opine on the legality of Obama's actions. \"The decision is unfounded and the court had no basis to issue such an order,\" said the official, who asked not to be named. \"No party in the case challenged the constitutionality of the immigration-related executive actions and the department's filing made it clear that the executive actions did not apply to the criminal matter before the court.\"\n\nIn a court filing earlier this month, prosecutors argued that Obama's decision to defer deportation of many immigrants did not limit criminal cases like the one against Juarez-Escobar. \"This policy...relates only to civil immigration enforcement status; it...has no effect on criminal prosecutions,\" prosecutors wrote in their filing. \"Modification of DHS policy to prioritize particular classes of unauthorized aliens in order to allocate resources for civil immigration enforcement does not limit the Department of Justice\u2019s prosecutorial decision on the criminal referral in this case.\"\n\nLawsuits challenging Obama's policies in a more direct way are pending in Washington, D.C., and Brownsville, Texas. A hearing on a request to block the presidential actions is scheduled for next week in the D.C. case, brought by Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio. In the Texas case, a total of 24 states are challenging the legality of Obama's immigration moves.\n\nWhile those cases have at least the theoretical possibility to halt Obama's actions, the Pennsylvania case\u2014as a criminal proceeding involving a single individual\u2014does not seem to have that potential. However, Schwab's ruling could have some impact, especially since lawyers handling the lawsuits pending in D.C. and Texas filed Schwab's opinion with the judges on those cases late Tuesday.\n\nSince Schwab is a Bush appointee, it will be tempting for many immigrant rights advocates to view his opinion as a political swipe at Obama. Indeed, many of the judge's arguments parallel those being put forward by Republican critics of the president's immigration actions. However, the judge's opinion raises a question that some advocates of more liberal immigration policies will not be able to dismiss so easily: why do not Obama's actions apply to criminal prosecutions as well as deportations? Indeed, what is the point of protecting immigrants from being expelled from the country if they can still be sent to prison for having illegally entered the country in the first place?\n\nSchwab wrote in his ruling Tuesday that he's open to Juarez-Escobar withdrawing a guilty plea he offered in October, less than a month before Obama announced plans to allow family members of U.S. citizens to stay in the U.S for up to three years and obtain work permits. Schwab's opinion appears to have been first reported by the Volokh Conspiracy blog.",
    " Title: Trump's Unconventional Approach: Achieving Campaign Promises in a Polarized Political Climate\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who took office in 2017 amidst a wave of negativity and skepticism, has been making strides in fulfilling his campaign promises, adopting an unconventional yet effective approach to governance.\n\nAccording to a report by the Pew Research Center, news stories about Trump's first 60 days in office were predominantly negative, with 62% of stories carrying a negative tone, compared to 20% for President Obama and 28% for both Bush and Clinton during their first 60 days. However, the president's supporters were seeking a departure from the status quo, and Trump has been delivering on that promise.\n\nEconomic growth, tax reform, and deregulation are some of the significant achievements of the Trump administration. The economy is experiencing growth not seen in years, the most comprehensive tax reform since 1986 has been enacted, and the number of pages in the Federal Register, where new regulations are published, is now two-thirds of what it was during the Obama years.\n\nTrump's impact on the judiciary is also noteworthy. He has made conservative judicial appointments, with 12 of his federal appeals court judge nominations confirmed by the Senate, and Neil Gorsuch has taken the seat of the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. With two Supreme Court justices over 80, Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, there is a high likelihood that Trump will have the opportunity to appoint another conservative justice during his first term.\n\nThe president is expected to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan at Camp David to discuss legislative plans for 2018. Key campaign issues still on the table include immigration reform, welfare reform, and national infrastructure investments. The outcome of these deliberations is expected to reflect a blend of idealism and political realism, addressing national priorities and what is feasible in the current political climate.\n\nThe Senate's Republican majority has narrowed to a razor-thin 51 to 49, posing a challenge for McConnell. However, Trump's determination to accomplish his goals, his way, remains unwavering. His decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel, despite significant opposition, is a testament to this.\n\nImmigration reform and welfare reform are two issues of critical importance, both requiring urgent attention and facing significant political hurdles. The inability of Washington to address these issues effectively was a significant driver of voter support for Trump. If Trump fails to address these issues, he risks becoming just another politician. However, given his track record and his commitment to fulfilling his campaign promises, it is reasonable to expect more unexpected accomplishments from Trump in 2018.\n\nTrump's inaugural address encapsulated his vision for America: \"And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit, or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their hearts with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.\" As Trump moves forward, it remains to be seen whether he can unite the nation under its founding ideals and make all Americans feel part of the American enterprise.",
    " Title: U.S. and European Economic Measures Boost Stocks to Best Day of 2012\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, stocks in the U.S. and Europe surged on Wednesday, marking their best day of the year, as speculation grew that governments in both regions would take action to support their economies.\n\nAtlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart, in a speech, highlighted the \"halting and tenuous\" recovery, suggesting that further monetary actions may be necessary if the current weak job growth trend continues. Meanwhile, news reports indicated that Germany and European Union officials were considering a plan to lend money from the European bailout fund to help rescue Spain's struggling banks.\n\nThese developments, while typically not causing a ripple in an ordinary stock market, had a significant impact in the current volatile market, which has been experiencing a series of declines due to the financial crisis in Europe and the slowing U.S. economy.\n\nJeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, noted that traders are now hanging on to rumors and speculation. However, the talk was enough to convince some that the worst was over for now. As a result, the Dow Jones industrial average surged 286.84 points to close at 12,414.79, its biggest gain since December 20.\n\nThe rally started early and gathered force in the afternoon. The charge turned the Dow Jones industrial average positive for 2012 and erased the biggest loss of the year less than a week after it happened: the 275-point plunge set off by a dismal U.S. jobs report on Friday.\n\nIn addition to the Dow, the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 29.63 points to 1,315.13, and the Nasdaq composite rose 66.61 points to 2,844.72. Companies whose stocks have been hardest hit over the past month had the best gains. Homebuilders rallied, helped by a strong earnings report from Hovnanian Enterprises and rising applications for new mortgages.\n\nThe gains were spread across the market. Only 11 companies in the S & P 500 dropped, and every industry group in the index rose, led by energy and financial companies. Roughly seven stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nJim Russell, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Cincinnati, Ohio, explained that it's natural for the market to have a strong day after an extended period of decline. On such days, it's usually the companies that were hit the hardest that fare best.\n\n\"In market language, it's called a technical bounce,\" he said. \"There's no bad news today, so the market goes up. Frankly, it's that simple.\"\n\nU.S. markets followed major European indexes higher. Indexes rose 2.4 percent in the U.K. and France. Borrowing costs eased for Spain, another positive sign.\n\nA Federal Reserve survey showed growth across the country. Hiring was steady, according to the Fed's \"Beige Book.\" This is in marked contrast to the government's monthly jobs report, which said employers added the fewest jobs in a year last month.\n\nThe dollar dipped and Treasury yields rose as investors moved money out of defensive investments. The yield on the benchmark rose to 1.64 percent from 1.57 percent late Tuesday.\n\nOther significant movers included Morgan Stanley, which jumped $1.08, 8 percent, to $13.94 amid reports that the Blackstone Group and other private equity firms may try to buy a stake in the bank's commodities business. UnitedHealth Group gained $1.66, 3 percent, to $57.70 after the health insurer said it will raise its quarterly dividend from 16 cents to 21 cents per share. The board also approved a plan to buy back stock.\n\nHowever, Tempur-Pedic International plunged $21.28, 49 percent, to $22.39. The mattress maker said it expects quarterly profits to fall by half compared to last year. Tempur-Pedic blamed its competitors' aggressive marketing campaigns and promotions for hurting its sales.",
    " Title: Analysis: Clinton and Sanders Face Off in New Hampshire Debate, Ahead of Tight Primary Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final debate before the New Hampshire primary, Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders faced off on Thursday night, with Clinton emphasizing Sanders' expansive government proposals as unrealistic, while Sanders focused on his progressive ideals.\n\nThe debate, held in Durham, New Hampshire, marked the only time the two candidates will meet before Tuesday's primary. This encounter is crucial for both candidates, as they are currently in a dead heat in Iowa and Clinton trails Sanders by 20 points in the latest NBC News/Marist poll in New Hampshire.\n\nEight years ago, Clinton found herself in a similar position in New Hampshire, with a significant loss to Barack Obama. This time around, the question is whether Clinton's current position is something to cry about. Although she ended up in a near tie with Sanders in Iowa despite a 40-point lead last summer, New Hampshire poses a challenge.\n\nSanders, unlike Obama, may not have the same organizational skills or ability to build a majority coalition among Democratic voters. In contrast to 2008, when Clinton was on the wrong side of history, she needn't panic in the moment.\n\nOne question that arises is why Clinton can't seem to be herself. As the Clinton team considers their strategy post-New Hampshire, they might want to consult the past campaigns of Mitt Romney, John McCain, and Bob Dole. All were nominees in their 60s or 70s, running a second or third time as their party's establishment choices. All made the tactical error of election-year conversions to more ideological personae that rang hollow with their party's grassroots activists.\n\nClinton, a known quantity with a solid resume, is often perceived as a dealmaker, much like her husband should she secure his former position. However, her repeated assertion of being a progressive who gets things done sounds contrived when compared to Sanders, a 74-year-old fervent socialist who speaks his mind.\n\nFrom the debate's outset, Clinton appeared intense and focused on debunking Sanders' 18 trillion dollar wish list of expansive government programs. While she is correct, she seems to be missing the point: successful Democratic presidential candidates thrive on personality and passion. The party's most celebrated standard-bearers \u2013 JFK, Bill Clinton, and Obama \u2013 ran as optimists, not scolds. The sooner someone convinces Clinton to shift from upbraid to upbeat \u2013 and stop trying to beat up Bernie \u2013 the better her long-term prospects.\n\nOne notable absence in the debate was any mention of Bill Clinton. In what may be a campaign first this election cycle, America was spared any talk of Donald Trump. The debate's organizers missed the chance to press Sanders on whether he would endorse Clinton should she become the nominee.\n\nAs the two candidates debated their progressive credentials, the irony was palpable: either Clinton or Sanders will win this Democratic battle. The two candidates will now turn their attention to the New Hampshire primary, with the results likely to have a significant impact on the Democratic race moving forward.",
    " Title: Trump Admits Son's Meeting with Russian Lawyer was to Obtain Information on Opponent, Stirring Legal Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump admitted that his son, Donald Trump Jr., met with Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016 at Trump Tower to obtain information on an opponent. The meeting, which is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into Russia's alleged role in helping Mr. Trump win the 2016 presidential election, could potentially constitute a breach of U.S. campaign rules, experts say.\n\nThe meeting is under scrutiny as it is being probed by the Special Counsel as part of the ongoing investigation into Russia's alleged role in the 2016 U.S. elections. Russia has repeatedly denied claims it interfered in the elections, where Mr. Trump defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn Sunday, U.S. media, including the Washington Post, CNN, and AP, reported that Mr. Trump was worried Donald Trump Jr could be in legal trouble because of the June 9, 2016 meeting with Ms. Veselnitskaya in New York. Mr. Trump tweeted, \"Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere.\"\n\nHowever, Mr. Trump's Sunday tweet appears to contradict a previous statement from the Trump camp about the meeting. When the meeting was first reported by the New York Times, Donald Trump Jr said in a statement that he and Ms. Veselnitskaya had mostly discussed a suspended program for Americans to adopt Russian children.\n\nHowever, he subsequently admitted he had agreed to the meeting after being told he would be offered information that would prove detrimental to Mrs. Clinton. He also released the email exchange that brought about the meeting.\n\nUS media then reported that the U.S. president had been involved in the initial statement his son issued on the meeting. This was initially denied by Mr. Trump's team, but his lawyers later confirmed that he had in fact dictated his son's statement.\n\nUS commentators have argued that Mr. Trump's new admission that the meeting was to gain information about Mrs. Clinton shows that the earlier statement was misleading. Mr. Trump again denied knowing about the meeting in Sunday's tweet.\n\nThe Trump team has argued that Mr. Trump Jr ultimately did not receive any damaging information about Mrs. Clinton at the meeting. Some analysts say that by having the meeting at all, Mr. Trump Jr broke the law. But others say it is unclear as no information reportedly exchanged hands at the meeting.\n\nOne of Mr. Trump's lawyers, Jay Sekulow, said on Sunday that the meeting had not broken any laws. \"The question is what law, statute or regulation's been violated? Nobody's pointed to one,\" Mr. Sekulow told ABC News.\n\nThe special counsel is currently investigating whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice. Under U.S. law, obstruction cases require proving \"corrupt intent\" - so while Mr. Trump's tweet does not prove anything illegal, it could serve as evidence of the president's intent. It is common for U.S. politicians to research their opponents during a campaign. However, legal experts say that Mr. Trump Jr could fall foul of campaign finance laws, which prohibit accepting anything of value from a foreign government or foreign national. Mr. Trump Jr's apparently enthusiastic response to the offer of information about Mrs. Clinton could also breach conspiracy laws.",
    " Title: Uncertainty Surrounds America's Alliances as Trump Takes Office\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Donald Trump assumes the presidency, the world's allies are grappling with the potential implications of his campaign rhetoric on the future of US-focused military alliances. From Canberra to Copenhagen, governments are anxiously awaiting clarification on Trump's stance towards these alliances, which have underpinned global peace and security since the end of World War II.\n\nSince the end of the war, a network of US-focused military alliances has been a cornerstone of global security. However, Trump has repeatedly questioned the value of these alliances, suggesting that America does not need them or that Washington should charge more for them. In April, he complained that European allies are \"ripping off the United States.\" Either they pay up, he said, or they have to get out. \"If it breaks up NATO, it breaks up NATO,\" he stated.\n\nTrump's comments have raised concerns, as European defense spending is not at the level that the US president-elect deems acceptable. Only four of America's 27 NATO allies have met the alliance target of devoting 2 percent of their GDP to defense, though European defense spending is now rising.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has emphasized that under Article 5 of NATO's 1949 founding treaty, all allies have made a solemn commitment to defend each other, and this is absolute and unconditioned. However, Trump's comments about the Baltic states' defense spending before deciding whether to defend them have raised eyebrows. Estonia's defense spending has already reached the required 2 percent of GDP, and its two neighbors are on track to hit that target in 2018.\n\nIn Asia, Trump's strategic intentions are also a source of concern. North Korea and China are expected to test Trump's approach early in his term with provocative moves. Trump's comments on the campaign trail have worried observers in the capitals of two key US allies, Japan and South Korea. However, recent phone conversations between Trump and the leaders of these countries have provided some reassurance.\n\nIn Japan, Trump reportedly agreed \"100 percent\" with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on the need to maintain the security alliance. In South Korea, Trump's comments about pulling American forces out of the country unless Seoul pays more for their upkeep have been tempered by his recent phone conversation with President Park Gyeung-hye, during which he reportedly agreed with Seoul on the need to maintain the security alliance.\n\nTrump's stance towards China is also unclear. Some signs suggest that he may be ready to abandon Asia to its fate, but recent comments have provided some reassurance to allies in the region.\n\nIn Australia, Trump's ascension has sparked unprecedented doubts about the future of a defense partnership with the United States that has undergirded the country's peace and prosperity since the end of World War II. With the signing of the ANZUS Treaty in 1951, Washington guaranteed Australia's security as it developed into one of the richest societies on earth. In return, Australian troops have fought alongside American forces in every war that Washington has fought.\n\nAs China flexes its military muscle more assertively, Australia's approach to the rise of China has been to build a deeper and broader alliance with the United States. If Australia becomes an independent state, that could potentially double its defense spending to make itself somewhat secure.\n\nIn conclusion, the world is watching with bated breath as Trump takes office, hoping for clarity on his stance towards US alliances. The future of these alliances, which have underpinned global peace and security for decades, hangs in the balance.",
    " Title: Georgia Secretary of State Investigates Minority Voter Registration Drive, Pastor Raphael Warnock Accuses Voter Suppression\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange this week, Pastor Raphael Warnock, the pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, accused Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp of voter suppression in connection with an ongoing investigation into a minority voter registration drive. The investigation, led by Kemp's office, is examining the New Georgia Project, a group associated with Warnock, for potential fraud in its efforts to register over 100,000 minority voters before the October 6 deadline.\n\nAt a press conference in Georgia's Capitol building, Warnock declared, \"You don't have to wear a hood -- you don't have to be a member of the Ku Klux Klan to be engaged in voter suppression. We know voter suppression when we see it.\" The charge, reminiscent of a dark period in the South's history, was directed squarely at Kemp.\n\nKemp, in response, told Fox News, \"There's somebody clearly doing something wrong. And we want to figure out who that is, and try to make sure that we stop that. And bring charges against those people.\"\n\nAt an emergency hearing of the state Election Board this week, Kemp's investigator Chris Harvey outlined the elements of the case. Harvey confirmed 28 cases of fraud in 14 counties, including 25 fraudulent voter registration applications and three fraudulent canvassing sheets. Some applications had forged signatures, while others contained false information. Another 26 cases were labeled suspicious. Falsifying a voter registration form is a felony in the state of Georgia.\n\nThe issue has gained significant attention this year due to the narrow margins in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga. Polls show Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn trailing Republican David Perdue. Nunn's campaign believes that if it makes significant inroads into signing up some of the 800,000 unregistered minority voters in Georgia, she could take the seat.\n\nThe New Georgia Project was founded by Georgia House Minority Leader Rep. Stacey Abrams. Abrams is a member of Nunn's so-called \"kitchen cabinet,\" advising the candidate. Abrams maintains a clear wall of separation between her work with the Nunn campaign and what she insists is a \"nonpartisan\" effort to get more minorities out to the polls in November.\n\nKemp has issued a subpoena to the New Georgia Project, demanding any and all documents and communications related to the voter registration drive by next Friday. The NGP has responded, proclaiming its innocence and stating that it is strictly following the law. Abrams complains that the subpoena is \"overly burdensome and an abuse of power,\" and is taking valuable time away from the group's voter registration drive.\n\n\"We do not object to sharing information, but what we do object to is a witch hunt -- and a fishing expedition,\" Abrams told the press conference.\n\nThe NGP has accused Kemp of a pattern of voter suppression and intimidation. They claim that of the 85,000 new voters they have signed up, 51,000 have not yet been registered. Kemp insists that any valid voter registration forms will be processed by the appropriate county officials and that his office is not blocking the registration of minority voters.\n\n\"I was very disappointed in a lot of the reverend's comments,\" Kemp told Fox News. \"I think anybody that knows me knows that I'm not a racist and some of the things that they've said and accused me of are just flat wrong.\"\n\nNew Georgia Project officials claim the words fraud, forgery, and felony have a chilling effect on any other organizations who might want to sign up new voters.\n\n\"Mr. Secretary of State, stop this dog and pony show with all of the subpoenas -- with all of the false accusations and the smear campaign, and do your job,\" Warnock demanded at the press conference.\n\nKemp insists his job is exactly what he is doing -- investigating reports of fraud and forgery brought to his attention by several counties. He told Fox News that with what is at stake in November, it's not a surprise the matter has become so politicized.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that it's gotten political, but we're in the silly season, if you will right now, and have some big races in Georgia.\"",
    " Title: DNC Chairman Urges States to Proceed with Primaries Amid COVID-19 Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that highlights the delicate balance between public health and democratic process, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez is advocating for states to hold their scheduled presidential primaries, despite federal guidance advising against large gatherings due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn Tuesday, states such as Florida, Illinois, and Arizona conducted their primaries as planned, while others like Ohio, Georgia, Kentucky, and Louisiana postponed their elections to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nPerez commended the states that pressed ahead, acknowledging the risks associated with people gathering and voting. In an interview with NPR, he stated, \"It's a false choice to suggest we either have to protect safety or protect and ensure our democracy. What you saw in Arizona today, and in Florida, was in Arizona more people voted early than voted in the entirety of the Democratic primary in 2016.\"\n\nArizona Democratic Party officials reported a surge in early mail-in voting, a trend Perez hopes other states will adopt. He further added, \"I've called on all the states that haven't gone yet to take these steps so that we can in fact have voting and protect our workers, our voters, our candidates.\"\n\nReports from CBS News indicated long lines and confusion at some polling places on Tuesday, with many poll workers staying home to avoid health risks. In contrast, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine (R) opted to postpone his state's primary to June, defying a judge's decision, as COVID-19 cases continued to rise. DeWine explained during a press conference, \"We should not force [voters and poll workers] to make this choice. A choice between their health and their Constitutional rights and their duties.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the two Democratic front-runners, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chose to engage with voters online rather than campaigning in person in Florida, Illinois, and Arizona on Tuesday. Biden emerged victorious in all three states.",
    " Title: Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl Faces Desertion and Misbehavior Charges Under Military Justice\n\nArticle:\n\nArmy Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was released last summer in a prisoner swap deal involving five top Taliban commanders, is facing charges of desertion and misbehavior in front of the enemy under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. If convicted, he could face life in prison.\n\nBergdahl's legal defense team will argue in military court that Bergdahl did not desert but was attempting to report wrongdoing within his Army unit. The Obama administration has previously defended the decision to secure Bergdahl's release, stating that he served with \"honor and distinction.\"\n\nHowever, a report from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) suggests that Bergdahl not only deserted his unit but deliberately sought out the Taliban and other enemies of the United States. This contradicts the accounts of many of Bergdahl's platoon members, who have maintained this version of events since the incident.\n\nLt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, speaking on Fox News' \"The O'Reilly Factor\" Monday night, revealed that a 2009 NCIS investigation into Sgt. Bergdahl's activities in Afghanistan showed clear evidence of his intention to defect to the Taliban.\n\n\"He had Afghan contacts and he was actually trying to offer himself up with the Taliban,\" Shaffer said. \"Both are very severe.\"\n\nShaffer added that the NCIS investigation, which included interviews with squad mates as well as Afghans working outside the wire, reportedly resulted in Bergdahl being charged with misbehavior toward the enemy.\n\nLt. Col. Shaffer also noted during the interview that President Obama would have been aware of Bergdahl's desertion through the NCIS before making the decision to negotiate his release.\n\nA preliminary Article 32 hearing has been scheduled for Bergdahl's case and will be held at Ft. Sam Houston, Texas. The exact date of the hearing has yet to be announced.",
    " Title: Senate Faces Pressure to Vote on Binding Keystone XL Pipeline Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nWith the midterm elections looming, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is under pressure to bring the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline to a vote. The pipeline, which has been a contentious issue for several years, has become a political hot potato as red-state Democrats face tough re-elections in November.\n\nReid is reportedly considering a non-binding \"sense of the Senate\" resolution, a measure that expresses support for the pipeline without any binding force. This approach would provide political cover for Democrats without forcing the issue on the White House. However, Republicans, and at least some Democrats, are pushing for a more substantial bill that would approve the pipeline.\n\nA bipartisan bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline was introduced on Thursday, and a vote could take place in the coming days. Reid has yet to announce his position on the matter, but he has expressed openness to any legislation that moves energy efficiency.\n\nSenator John Thune (R-SD) has called for a binding vote on the Keystone pipeline during the upcoming debate on energy efficiency. \"In that debate, we ought to have a binding vote on the Keystone pipeline that would force that issue to the American people,\" Thune said.\n\nThe Obama administration has repeatedly delayed making a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline, leading to calls for congressional action from both the left and right. Among the at-risk 2014 Democrats is Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu, who has co-sponsored the latest bill and has expressed her intention to push for a vote in the coming weeks.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney has warned lawmakers that congressional action could slow down the process and that the pipeline should be run \"outside of politics.\" However, critics argue that the Keystone XL pipeline is no longer a political issue but a matter of national interest.\n\nThe Senate has already passed a non-binding resolution in support of the pipeline in March 2013, with a vote of 62-37. In the Republican-controlled House, there remains strong support for building the project. Georgia Representative John Barrow, a Democrat who is a vocal critic of the Obama administration on this issue, has argued that further delays in constructing the pipeline will result in the U.S. missing out on tens of thousands of jobs and continuing to depend on foreign oil from hostile countries.\n\nBarrow has also pointed out that the oil from the Keystone XL pipeline could replace the 900,000 barrels of oil the U.S. currently gets from Venezuela, a country that is not considered a reliable ally. Barrow's question is who will be the first to use the oil if the pipeline is not built.\n\nCapitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Capitol Hill team.

    " Title: Email Scandal Threatens Hillary Clinton's Presidential Ambitions as Trustworthiness Concerns Mount\n\nArticle:\n\nHillary Clinton is facing mounting criticism over new allegations that she sent top-secret information from a non-secure email account while serving as Secretary of State. The intelligence community's inspector general revealed this week that some of Clinton's messages contained information classified above \"top secret,\" a claim that has been corroborated by Fox News.\n\nAccording to Fox News, the information is so sensitive that even senators, who already have clearance, must go through additional security measures to view some of the information Clinton was sending. The Clinton campaign has accused the inspector general, I. Charles McCullough, of politically motivated leaks intended to sabotage her campaign.\n\nHowever, the email scandal appears to be taking a toll on Clinton's image. Surveys show that voters view her primary challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders, as more honest and trustworthy.\n\n\"Trustworthiness is not a problem by itself for Clinton, but combined with other past and present scandals weighing her down, alternative candidates like Sanders begin to look more appealing,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston who specializes in political leadership. \"For a candidate with enough negative stories and rumors about them as Hillary Clinton, her campaign can refute individual charges to win a daily news battle but lose the larger perception war.\"\n\nA recent Quinnipiac University Poll found that 93 percent of Democratic primary voters consider Sanders honest and trustworthy, while just 66 percent said the same of Clinton. A CNN survey conducted this month found that 55 percent of Democratic voters consider Clinton to be the \"least honest\" candidate in the race.\n\nReports surfaced this week that Clinton's private email server contained several dozen more classified emails than previously thought, including some from \"special access programs,\" or SAP. Even top members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations are unable to view such messages without additional security steps, including signing new nondisclosure agreements, according to Fox News.\n\n\"These declarations cover several dozen emails containing classified information determined to be at the confidential, secret, and top secret/sap levels,\" Mr. McCullough said in a letter to lawmakers obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nClinton pushed back against the reports in an interview with NPR, maintaining that she never knowingly sent or received classified email on her private server. \"As the State Department has confirmed, I never sent or received any material marked classified, and that hasn't changed in all of these months,\" she said.\n\nClinton's campaign argued that the emails in question appear to be forwards of a New York Times article on a classified drone program and that the messages seem to have been retroactively classified.\n\n\"How a New York Times public article that goes around the world could be in any way viewed as classified, or the fact that it would be sent to other people off of The New York Times site, I think, is one of the difficulties that people have in understanding what this is about,\" Clinton told NPR.\n\nThe State Department is under a court order to produce about 55,000 emails from Clinton's home server. Most have been released, with the last of them expected on Jan. 29\u2014just days before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.\n\nClinton's use of private email has been a source of controversy since it was first revealed publicly in March 2015. She began returning her emails to the State Department after the Obama administration, prodded by a House investigation into the Benghazi affair, discovered that Clinton had taken all of her messages with her when she left the State Department at the end of Obama's first term.\n\nThe administration then said that Clinton had refused to use a regular email account on the State.gov email server and instead used a private server that she kept in her home in New York. Clinton has since said she regrets using the private server, but has steadfastly maintained that she did not use the private account to send or receive classified information.\n\nInvestigations have also found that the State Department has botched open records requests for Clinton's emails. As of Jan. 7, 177 requests for documents from Clinton were still pending, according to the State Department inspector general.\n\nSpecialists say that voters on the fence in the Democratic primary election may very well take the email scandal\u2014and the larger questions about Clinton's honesty\u2014into account when picking a candidate.\n\n\"The problem for Hillary Clinton is that there are alternatives to her candidacy in Bernie Sanders. This is why polls of Democrats don't think Sanders can win [the general election] but are willing to vote for him anyway,\" Mr. Rottinghaus said.",
    " Title: Kerry Walks Back \"Apartheid\" Comment, Denies Alleged Criticism of Israel\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Secretary of State John Kerry has walked back his comments regarding Israel's potential future as an apartheid state, denying that he ever made such a statement. The initial remarks, reported by The Daily Beast's Josh Rogin, were made during a closed-door meeting with influential world leaders on Friday.\n\nKerry's use of the term \"apartheid\" has been met with criticism from Jewish leaders in America and Israel, as the term is rarely, if ever, used by senior American officials in reference to Israel, and President Obama has previously rejected the idea that the term should apply to the Jewish state.\n\nIn a statement released by the State Department last night, Kerry stated, \"I will not allow my commitment to Israel to be questioned by anyone, particularly for partisan, political purposes.\" He went on to clarify his remarks, stating, \"Israel is a vibrant democracy and I do not believe, nor have I ever stated, publicly or privately, that Israel is an apartheid state or that it intends to become one.\"\n\nKerry also addressed the power of words to create a misimpression, stating, \"If I could rewind the tape, I would have chosen a different word to describe my firm belief that the only way in the long term to have a Jewish state and two nations and two peoples living side by side in peace and security is through a two-state solution.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Orthodox Union, an American Jewish organization, has criticized the 2012 Democratic National Convention for refusing to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in their platform. The Orthodox Union's executive director for public policy, Nathan Diament, issued a statement expressing disappointment in the decision, stating, \"Facts are facts; Jerusalem is Israel's capital, and America's national leaders do no service to the people of the Middle East or the world by refusing to acknowledge these crucial facts.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding Kerry's comments and the Democratic Party's stance on Jerusalem serves as a reminder of the ongoing complexities and sensitivities surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",
    " Title: Obama's Executive Actions on Gun Control: A Shift from Skepticism to Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic shift from his skepticism towards executive power during his time as a University of Chicago law instructor, President Barack Obama is now employing executive actions to push through his agenda, particularly on the contentious issue of gun control. This transformation, seven years into his presidency, has seen Obama become a master of executive action, even after stating he had done everything he could when Congress fails to act.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House is set to announce new measures on gun control, with a televised town hall on the subject scheduled for Thursday night, and gun violence expected to be a focus in next week's State of the Union address. One of the new measures aims to tighten the so-called \"gun-show loophole\" by requiring occasional gun dealers, such as those who sell at gun shows and over the internet, to obtain licenses and conduct background checks on buyers.\n\nAdministration officials also revealed plans to boost enforcement of federal gun laws, including the hiring of additional FBI personnel to process background checks. However, some of Obama's new gun measures, including the allocation of an additional $500 million in federal funds to increase access to mental health care, require congressional approval.\n\nThe use of executive orders has drawn criticism from the Republican presidential candidates, who have uniformly decried Obama's aggressive use of executive power. On Saturday, front-runner Donald Trump vowed to \"unsign\" any gun control measures Obama enacts unilaterally, while Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have also criticized Obama's actions on guns.\n\nDespite the criticism, it is likely that the next president, regardless of party affiliation, will follow Obama's lead on the use of executive authority. The Republican presidential field, if it sweeps the 2016 elections, is expected to face a raft of measures being eliminated with a quick signature, on matters ranging from gun control to immigration to women's reproductive health.\n\nThe use of executive orders has become a common tactic for presidents to bypass a gridlocked Congress, particularly when legislation is unlikely to pass. This was evident in Obama's immigration policy, where he deferred deportation for young illegal immigrants in 2013, only to announce a plan to defer deportation for an additional 4 million people in 2014.\n\nOn gun control, Obama's approach has been two-fold: executive action and legislation. After the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, Obama signed 23 executive actions related to gun control, while efforts in Congress to expand background checks on gun buyers and ban assault weapons failed.\n\nObama's push for gun control is driven by a moral conviction, viewing gun violence as a scourge of society. Despite high-profile incidents involving legally obtained weapons, Obama remains undeterred in his efforts to keep guns out of the \"wrong hands.\" In a meeting with Justice Department officials on Monday, Obama stated that his team's recommendations for strengthening gun control measures are \"well within my legal authority and the executive branch,\" and also \"ones that the overwhelming majority of the American people, including gun owners, support and believe in.\"",
    " Title: Emerging Portrait of Florida School Shooter Nikolas Cruz Reveals Troubled Past and Online Hints of Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 lives were lost, a portrait of the shooter, Nikolas Cruz, is beginning to emerge. According to interviews with people who knew him, court documents, and an analysis of Cruz's online writings and videos, the 19-year-old Broward County man had a history of disturbing behavior and hints of future violence.\n\nCruz, who legally purchased an AR-15-style rifle last year, carried out the nation's most recent mass killing on Valentine's Day. His mother, Lynda Cruz, died last fall, leaving him without parents. He was taken in by the parents of a schoolmate, according to that family's attorney.\n\nA former classmate, who grew up with Cruz and attended school with him since the sixth grade, said Cruz would sometimes introduce himself as a \"school shooter.\" The student, who asked not to be named, told CNN, \"He was very, very strange. Like if there was someone to shoot up a school, it would be him.\"\n\nCruz's behavior was not limited to school. A former neighbor, concerned about Cruz \"acting weird\" in the backyard, took video of him dressed in boxer shorts shooting what appeared to be a BB gun. Another neighbor reported Cruz to the FBI after he made an online comment about a mass shooting in New York this summer.\n\nCruz's online presence also revealed two Instagram accounts featuring weapons and photos. In one picture, he is wearing a kerchief over his face and a Make America Great Again hat. Another photo is taken from behind a gun sight looking out the window.\n\nDespite the troubling signs, not everyone who crossed paths with Cruz saw reason for concern. The attorney for the family who took him in after his mother's death said they were aware of trouble he'd earlier had at school and saw signs of depression. However, they did not see any danger.\n\nAuthorities believe Cruz was initially able to leave the crime scene by blending in with students fleeing campus in the wake of the massacre. He was later found by police and taken into custody. He has since confessed to the killings, according to court documents.\n\nCruz's public defenders are reportedly exploring mental health issues and the possibility of autism. One of his public defenders, Gordon Weekes, said he believed Cruz has been placed on suicide watch. The defense team is \"trying to save this young man's life,\" Weekes said.",
    " Title: The Call for a Scientific Revolution in the GOP: A Comparative Analysis of Democratic and Republican Campaign Strategies\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, a heated debate has ensued within the Republican Party, with some critics arguing for a radical shift in strategy, akin to a \"scientific revolution.\" This call to action stems from the perceived failures of the Romney campaign and the Republican Party at large, as highlighted by Democratic pollster Pat Caddell's passionate speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nCaddell, along with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, accused establishment Republican consultants of ideological softness and a focus on approval from the D.C. elite and financial gain, rather than political victory. These accusations are part of a growing chorus of criticism leveled at the Romney campaign's polling, messaging, strategy, tactics, and targeting.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to avoid turning this self-examination into a witch-hunt, as some argue that everything a losing campaign did was wrong and everything a winning campaign did was right. It is likely that many of the same individuals being condemned today would be praised had an unforeseen event led to a President Romney.\n\nThe key to moving forward, according to these critics, is the adoption of a more scientific approach to campaign strategy, similar to the one employed by the Democratic Party over the past decade. This approach involves the use of randomized, controlled experiments to test the effectiveness of messages and tactics.\n\nThe Democratic Party, in alliance with academic social scientists, has used this method to build an objective base of knowledge on what works and what doesn't. This has led to a culture of testing within the Democratic Party, where expert opinions are treated as hypotheses to be tested through experiments.\n\nFor instance, the Obama campaign's heavy investment in grassroots field offices and the use of voter engagement tactics such as strange video pledges and \"voter report cards\" can be traced back to the results of these experiments, which indicated these strategies provided the highest vote return despite their expense and difficulty.\n\nThe Republican Party, it seems, could greatly benefit from adopting a similar approach, moving away from conventional wisdom and towards a more empirical, evidence-based strategy. This shift could help the GOP better understand what works and what doesn't, ultimately leading to more effective campaigns and, potentially, electoral success.",
    " Title: \"Russian Cyberattacks on U.S. Government Agencies: A Stealthy and Politically Motivated Threat\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent analysis, former defense cybersecurity experts have highlighted the stealthy and politically motivated cyberattacks carried out by Russian hacking groups on U.S. government agencies over the past few years. These attacks, which have largely gone unnoticed until now, have targeted critical infrastructure such as the State Department, the White House, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThe Russian hacking group, which began its systematic attacks in 2014 and 2015, managed to infiltrate these agencies with significant success. According to Michael Sulmeyer, a former cybersecurity expert for the secretary of defense, and Ben Buchanan, now both of the Harvard Cyber Security Project, the Russian hackers used sophisticated techniques to trick government computers into sending out data while disguising the command and control messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions.\n\nThe State Department was so severely affected that it repeatedly shut down its systems in an attempt to evict the intruders. At one point, officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them.\n\nPresident Barack Obama was briefed regularly on these attacks, but he chose not to publicly name the Russians or impose sanctions. The decision, which many in the White House now regret, was reportedly due to fears of escalating a cyberwar and the need for Russia's cooperation in negotiations over Syria.\n\nThese revelations underscore the evolving nature of cyber threats and the need for increased vigilance and response from governments and private organizations alike. As the U.S. and other nations grapple with the challenges posed by cyberattacks, the stealthy tactics employed by Russian hackers serve as a reminder of the potential risks and consequences of such activities.",
    " Title: GOP Debate Highlights: Rubio, Cruz, Trump, Graham, Christie, Paul, Carson, Bush, Fiorina, and Kasich\n\nArticle:\n\nThe fifth Republican presidential debate on Tuesday night, held in Las Vegas, showcased the impact of the Paris and San Bernardino attacks, with a significant focus on terrorism. The following is a summary of the key performances of the candidates:\n\n1. Marco Rubio: The Florida senator, known for his consistent debating style throughout the early election season, displayed clear convictions, a common-sense policy framework, and an optimistic demeanor. He presented himself as a confident candidate without the braggadocio of Donald Trump, showcasing a likeability that stems from his personal story and avoiding the Senate speak that afflicted others on stage.\n\n2. Ted Cruz: The Texas senator was the most relentless counter-puncher, scoring points with his passionate and black-and-white diagnoses of issues that appeal to evangelicals and the conservative wing of the party.\n\n3. Donald Trump: In a city that values entertainment, the billionaire delivered another Main Act performance. While his debating skills may rank below others on the stage, he has a substantial bloc of support due to his take-no-hostages, make-no-apologies, and double-down style that criticizes the political ruling class, answers challenges with insults, and reduces every solution to a declaration, \"I can do it.\" His humorous embrace of Mr. Cruz near the end of the debate was a classic showman's move.\n\n4. Lindsey Graham: The South Carolina senator was the dominant winner of the undercard debate. His communication skills, honed by years of frequent TV talk-show appearances, dwarfed the rest of the field in the consolation debate. His three decades in the Air Force and Air Force Reserves allowed him to dominate the discussion on fighting terrorism and rebuilding the U.S. military.\n\n5. Chris Christie: His New Jersey schtick may be getting a bit old, but this debate played to his strengths as a former federal prosecutor after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He scored some effective points when he counterpunched after Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz got bogged down in a debate on Senate legislative minutiae that most Americans never heard of. He also provided the most pointed attack on President Obama, calling the man he once hugged after Superstorm Sandy as a \"feckless weakling.\"\n\n6. Rand Paul: The Kentucky senator scored some points against several onstage in his most assertive performance to date, but at times he seemed evasive or circular in reasoning when the debate moderators tried to pin him down on his own positions or his differences with parts of the GOP debate.\n\n7. Ben Carson: He was more confident and explicit in discussing his foreign policy positions\u2014a challenge where he has struggled in the past\u2014while retaining the likeability that's at the core of his popularity.\n\n8. Jeb Bush: He gave a more assertive performance than prior debates and has a White House-worthy resume, but still comes off like the middle daughter Jan from \"The Brady Bunch\"\u2014always complaining about everything \"Donald, Donald, Donald.\"\n\n9. Carly Fiorina: She seemed flat, and grumpy and indignant onstage. Her repeated efforts to inject herself into the debate with her screed \"This is what is wrong in Washington\" didn't prove effective.\n\n10. John Kasich: The Ohio governor has a record of success in Ohio but he comes off on the national stage more like a dour college professor lecturing students than a presidential contender with an optimistic vision for America.",
    " Title: Obama Breaks Tradition, Launches Ambitious Campaign During Republican National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a departure from the usual protocol, President Barack Obama will embark on a series of campaign trips next week, coinciding with the Republican National Convention where Mitt Romney is set to be officially nominated as the Republican presidential candidate. While the Republicans gather in Tampa, Florida, to nominate Mitt Romney, Mr. Obama will be campaigning at college campuses in Ames, Iowa, and Fort Collins, Colorado, on Tuesday, and in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Wednesday, the third day of the Republican convention.\n\nVice President Joe Biden will be in Tampa for campaign events on the first two days of the Republican convention, and First Lady Michelle Obama will appear on \"The Late Show With David Letterman\" on Wednesday.\n\nThis move by Mr. Obama to campaign during the Republican convention is a departure from the traditional practice of incumbent presidents staying home while the opposing party plots their defeat. In 2004, President George W. Bush kept a low profile during the Democratic National Convention, although Vice President Dick Cheney did campaign during the Democratic convention. In 1996, 1992, 1984, and 1980, Presidents Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Reagan, and Carter, respectively, laid low while the opposing parties' conventions were held.\n\nObama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki stated that Mr. Obama, the first lady, and Mr. Biden will be \"laying out the choice the American people are facing in November, cutting through some of the political chatter\" while Republicans are meeting.\n\nStephen Hess, a scholar on the presidency at the Brookings Institution, downplayed the suggestion that the 24/7 news media cycle is responsible for breaking the unwritten rule about not campaigning during an opponent's convention. \"I prefer to think of the new habit of campaigning during opponents' conventions as just another example of disrespect for the forms of behavior that define civilized conduct,\" Mr. Hess said.\n\nAlthough presidents typically don't campaign during the opposing party's convention, challengers often try to make news during their rival's moment in the sun. In 2008, both Mr. Obama and Republican John McCain campaigned during each other's nominating parties. In 2004, Mr. Kerry and running mate John Edwards campaigned during the GOP convention. In 1988, both George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis campaigned during the other's convention.\n\nAs Mr. Obama seeks to re-energize young voters next week on three college campuses, a poll shows what the president is facing. The survey by the nonprofit group Generation Opportunity found that 89 percent of voters younger than 30 say the economy is affecting their daily lives negatively. The poll also found that 64 percent of young voters think the availability of more quality, full-time jobs upon graduation is more important than lower student-loan interest rates, an issue on which Mr. Obama waged a high-profile battle with Congress this summer.\n\nThe poll indicates that young voters are motivated to vote this year, with 76 percent saying they intend to go to the polls in November. However, it might not be good news for Mr. Obama, who is seeking to recapture the youth vote that helped him win four years ago.\n\nThe unemployment rate for 18- to 29-year-olds overall in July was 12.7 percent; it was 22.3 percent for blacks in the same age range. If the 1.7 million young adults who have given up looking for jobs are included, the actual unemployment rate for voters younger than 30 is 16.7 percent.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Lax Oversight at FDA in Ensuring Effectiveness of Opioid Prescription Training Program\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine has revealed that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has failed to adequately track the effectiveness of a key strategy aimed at addressing opioid misuse. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University found that the FDA has not been able to demonstrate the success of a federal program that teaches doctors about the risks of prescribing addictive opioids.\n\nThe study, led by Caleb Alexander, an author on the research, scrutinized thousands of pages of internal FDA documents obtained through public records requests. The documents reveal that the FDA's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program, which requires opioid manufacturers to pay for training for doctors prescribing long-acting opioids, has not shown any significant impact on overdoses and deaths.\n\nThe REMS program, implemented in 2012, was designed to monitor the impact of the training on overdoses and deaths related to long-acting opioids. However, according to the Johns Hopkins researchers, opioid manufacturers did not collect the necessary data to track the training's progress, and the FDA did not correct the issue even after becoming aware of it.\n\nThe study found that only 27% of doctors who prescribe long-acting opioids enrolled in a training class between 2012 and 2016. Manufacturers' surveys concluded that physicians who participated in the training had \"modestly greater\" knowledge of safe prescribing practices, but these surveys were conducted during a period when opioid prescribing rates were declining overall in the United States, and they were not designed to prove the classes were responsible for the change.\n\nThe opioid crisis continues to claim lives, with nearly 50,000 people dying from opioid overdoses in 2017. In response to the study, an FDA spokesperson stated that the issue of opioid misuse is a top priority for the Trump administration. The spokesperson acknowledged the challenges in assessing the impact of the training program while accounting for other opioid interventions at various levels of government.\n\nThe FDA spokesperson also noted that the agency has taken other steps to combat the epidemic, such as going after illegal opioid imports and sales, and supporting more treatment for people struggling with addiction. Opioid prescription rates peaked in 2012 and fell in 2017 to 58.7 prescriptions per 100 people nationally, compared with 81.3 prescriptions per 100 people in 2012. However, rates remain high in certain areas of the country, and while deaths are starting to decrease, they reached a record high of nearly 50,000 in 2017.",
    " Title: Obama Addresses HealthCare.gov Fiasco, Acknowledges Mistakes in ACA Rollout\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a candid press conference on Thursday, President Barack Obama addressed the ongoing issues with the rollout of HealthCare.gov, the website serving as the portal to the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) new insurance market. The president, who has described the ACA as his signature legislative achievement, acknowledged the problems that have arisen since the site's Oct. 1 launch.\n\nThe president expressed regret over the \"keep your plan\" promise that has proven to be inaccurate for more than 3 million Americans who have received cancellation notices. He admitted that the assumption was that the majority of those affected would find better policies at lower costs in the marketplaces, but this has not been the case for many.\n\nObama also addressed the systemic problems that have taken longer to fix and are still being worked on. He acknowledged that the \"grandfather clause,\" which allowed plans in place before the ACA passed to continue, did not work as intended.\n\nThe president took responsibility for the difficulties faced by Americans and expressed his understanding of the frustration and concern caused by the cancellation notices. He emphasized his commitment to fixing the issues and alleviating the burden on those affected.\n\nIn addition, Obama criticized the federal procurement system for technology, stating that it is cumbersome, complicated, and outdated. He suggested that the federal government's approach to technology procurement is a significant factor in the chronic delays and cost overruns associated with federal IT projects.\n\nLooking ahead, the president indicated that he would engage in \"Monday morning quarterbacking\" regarding HealthCare.gov, suggesting that more could have been done to anticipate the problems that have arisen. However, he emphasized the need to move forward and address the ongoing issues with the site.\n\nThe president's remarks come as he faces criticism from both sides of the political aisle and as some Democrats, particularly those up for reelection in 2014, grapple with the political fallout of the ACA's rocky rollout. The president's acknowledgment of the problems and his commitment to addressing them may help to alleviate some of the political pressure he and his fellow Democrats are facing.",
    " Title: Texas Governor Rick Perry's Aggressive Job Recruitment Campaigns Spark Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to attract businesses from other states, Texas Governor Rick Perry's high-profile recruitment campaigns, characterized by radio and magazine ads, personal appearances, and bold promises of low-tax, pro-growth policies, have sparked controversy and backlash, particularly from prominent Democrats across the nation.\n\nPerry's campaigns, which criticize the business climate in states like California and Illinois, have been met with criticism and mockery, with Democrats labeling his efforts as clownish and warning him to keep his hands off. California Governor Jerry Brown famously compared Perry's incursions into California to breaking wind.\n\nHowever, some observers argue that Perry's tactics are part of a clever marketing strategy and smart politics. Mark McKinnon, a political strategist with deep Texas ties, told \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"At the end of the day, no matter how any of the [states] respond, people are left with two distinct messages: That guy down in Texas has got big brass balls and he's creating a lot of jobs.\"\n\nPerry's aggressive job raids into blue states like Illinois and California this year are seen as the most aggressive in the nation, according to experts. Mark Muro, a senior fellow and director of policy for the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, noted, \"It's irresistible to a lot of governors, but Perry has been the leader. This is not necessarily the best way for state executives to spend time, but it's hard to resist. It's politically attractive, the chief executive is seen as, quote, 'trying to do something.' Any successful relocation offers the tried-and-true moment of the ribbon cutting, so it's pretty intoxicating stuff.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama's home state of Illinois has been a target for several Republican governors, including Chris Christie of New Jersey, Scott Walker of Wisconsin, and Rick Scott of Florida. They have all attempted to lure Illinois companies to move and set up shop in their lower-tax, lower-regulation states. Even Scott acknowledged, in a letter to members of the Illinois business community, that Texas is leading the way. He noted that Florida is \"nipping at the heels of Texas everyday, as we approach the No. 1 spot.\"\n\nThose who have been on the receiving end of Perry's recruitment efforts say that his grating style is as notable as the substance of his pitch. Doug Whitley, the president and CEO of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce, told \u2588\u2588\u2588, \"The biggest difference with Perry was, he was kind of like a Roman emperor coming into town with horns blowing in front of his arrival, his parade.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Governor Rick Perry's aggressive job recruitment campaigns have sparked controversy and backlash, particularly from Democrats, who view his tactics as clownish and disrespectful. However, Perry's tactics have also been praised by some as a clever marketing strategy and smart politics. The success of his campaigns remains to be seen, but it is clear that Perry is leading the way in the aggressive recruitment of businesses from other states.",
    " Title: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's Condition Improves: From Serious to Fair at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the medical condition of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, has improved. Hospital officials at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center upgraded his condition from serious to fair on Tuesday.\n\nTsarnaev, 19, had been listed in serious condition since his capture on Thursday night in a Watertown, Massachusetts backyard. He is currently under heavy guard at the hospital.\n\nThe U.S. attorney's Office for Massachusetts announced the change in Tsarnaev's condition at noon Tuesday EDT via a tweet. \"According to Beth Israel Deaconess, at noon today, Dzhokhar Tsarvaev's condition is listed as \u2018fair.\u2019 Releasing info at request of BIDMC,\" the tweet read.\n\nTsarnaev, along with his deceased brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, are suspected of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombings that resulted in three deaths and over 170 injuries.\n\nHours after the FBI released photos of the then-unidentified suspects, the Tsarnaev brothers allegedly committed a carjacking and murdered an MIT police officer before engaging in a firefight with authorities early Friday morning, which left Tamerlan Tsarnaev dead.\n\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev was arraigned on two terrorism-related charges on Monday. During a court hearing conducted at his bedside at Beth Israel, the 19-year-old suspect nodded his head in response to questions and answered \"no\" when asked if he had enough money to hire an attorney, according to a transcript of the proceedings.\n\nThe criminal complaint charging Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with the bombings indicated he sustained wounds to his \"head, neck, leg, and hand.\"\n\nTsarnaev's next court hearing has been scheduled for May 30.\n\nThe news of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's improving medical condition comes as new details emerge regarding the brothers' plans, had they not been apprehended or killed by authorities.\n\nAccording to CBS News, the suspected bombers were considering traveling to New York City, as revealed by the carjacking victim. \"The only word I recognized was Manhattan,\" the Mercedes-Benz owner told police, adding that most of the conversation between the brothers was conducted in Russian.",
    " Title: US Employment Dips in September Amid Hurricane Impact, Labor Market Remains Strong\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the US employment market experienced a decline in September, marking the first such occurrence since 2010. The Labor Department reported a loss of 33,000 jobs, primarily due to the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which struck Texas and Florida in late August and early September.\n\nThe leisure and hospitality sector bore the brunt of the job losses, with a record drop in employment in this sector. The Labor Department attributed the decline to the two storms. Economists had anticipated a rise of 90,000 jobs last month, but the hurricanes prevented this from happening.\n\nDespite the job losses, the unemployment rate slipped to 4.2%, the lowest since February 2001. This discrepancy between the two September reports suggests that the jobs decline does not indicate a long-term trend.\n\nGus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services, commented, \"Although the headline number for September is a loss of jobs, the first in seven years, the labor market remains in good shape.\"\n\nThe strongest job gains last month came from the health care and transportation and warehousing industries. However, employment in the leisure and hospitality sector shrank significantly, while job figures in many other industries, including construction and government, were largely unchanged.\n\nThe US has been experiencing one of the longest stretches of job creation in its history, with the economy adding a monthly average of over 170,000 jobs over the past year. Economists have predicted that this pace would slow, but the wage gains they expected to accompany tightening in the labor market have been elusive.\n\nThe September report showed that average hourly earnings rose 0.5% from August and have now risen 2.9% over the past 12 months. Naeem Aslam, a ThinkMarkets analyst, said, \"The earnings figure shows that job market slack is fading.\"\n\nDespite weaker-than-expected wage inflation, economists do not see anything in the September report that would dissuade the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates before the end of the year, as expected. Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \"Unemployment is what matters, and this report therefore makes a December rate hike even more likely.\"\n\nRevised jobs estimates for July and August showed US employers added 38,000 fewer jobs than previously reported. However, Mr. Shepherson expects recovery to begin in October, with a bigger rebound in November.",
    " Title: Trump Urges House Republicans to Rally Behind Obamacare Repeal and Replace Bill as GOP Leaders Push for Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump will visit the Capitol on Tuesday to personally lobby House Republicans to support the GOP's legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The push comes as Republican leaders work to secure the necessary 216 votes to pass the bill during a floor vote scheduled for Thursday.\n\nThe amended bill does not significantly increase tax credits for Americans aged 50 to 64, but it leaves room for the Senate to make changes in this area. The bill does, however, formalize agreed-upon changes to Medicaid designed to appease conservative lawmakers.\n\n\"This is our long-awaited chance to finally get rid of Obamacare,\" Mr. Trump said at a rally in Kentucky. He added that he is willing to work with Sen. Rand Paul to make necessary changes to the health bill and then move on to tax reform.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus, a group of 30-plus Republicans that frequently spars with leadership, remains a significant obstacle to the bill in the lower chamber. The group has not yet taken an official position on the bill, leaving the door open for negotiations with Mr. Trump and GOP leadership.\n\nRepublicans can afford to lose no more than 21 GOP votes, as every Democrat is expected to reject the bill. The GOP plan repeals most of Obamacare's taxes and its individual mandate, replaces the ACA's generous subsidies with refundable, age-based tax credits, and reins in and caps spending on Medicaid by 2020.\n\nA \"manager's amendment\" submitted late Monday would repeal many of Obamacare's taxes sooner, this year instead of 2018, while barring any more states from expanding their Medicaid populations and receiving generous federal matching funds outlined by the 2010 law. The implementation of the so-called \"Cadillac tax\" on particularly generous employer plans is moved back from 2025 to 2026.\n\nDemocrats have invited former Vice President Joe Biden to the Capitol on Wednesday to rally in defense of Obamacare, saying the GOP bill would unwind its extension of coverage to more than 20 million Americans. The House Rules Committee will meet early Wednesday to vet final changes to the GOP replacement and set the terms of debate for floor votes on Thursday, the seventh anniversary of Obamacare's passage.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the plan would save more than $300 billion but result in 24 million fewer people being insured a decade from now. Criticism of the plan continues to pour in, with doctors' groups and America's Catholic bishops saying the legislation falls short in maintaining coverage for needy Americans.\n\nRepublican leaders have pleaded with conservatives and outside lobbies to give them more time. They say the bill, which leverages budget rules to avoid a Democratic filibuster later on, is simply the first part of a three-pronged strategy to bring health costs down. Phase two involves regulatory action by the Trump administration, while phase three would require Democratic support for future GOP legislation.\n\nMr. Trump has already won over members of the Republican Study Committee by agreeing to amendments that would make changes to Medicaid. The changes would allow states to impose work requirements on able-bodied people in the program and let governors accept a block grant of federal funding for the program instead of a per-capita allotment.",
    " Title: College Students and Community Members Rally to Fill Bank of America Stadium for Obama's Democratic Convention Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nCollege students from various universities across North Carolina and members of predominantly black churches in neighboring South Carolina are making their way to Charlotte in preparation for the Democratic National Convention. The goal is to fill the 74,000-seat Bank of America Stadium to capacity when President Obama delivers his acceptance speech on Thursday night.\n\nThe Democratic Party has been concerned for months about the possibility of not filling the stadium, as polls indicate decreased voter enthusiasm for Obama and smaller crowds at his battleground state campaign rallies. However, Obama advisers are confident that the stadium will be filled, with Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry also set to speak on Thursday night.\n\nElena Botella, the president of the College Democrats of North Carolina and a student at Duke University, said her school is busing 100 students to the speech. Lonnie Randolph, the president of the South Carolina chapter of the NAACP, said several large black churches in his state are planning to send busloads of members to watch the president's speech.\n\nObama aides have distributed several thousand tickets to new campaign volunteers in North Carolina, with people who complete three volunteer shifts totaling nine hours receiving one ticket to the final speech. This volunteer ticketing program also helps Obama boost his grassroots network in North Carolina, a battleground state he moved into the Democratic column in 2008 for the first time in nearly 40 years.\n\nHowever, Obama is facing an uphill battle in North Carolina this time around, as the unemployment rate exceeds the national average and voters approved a gay marriage ban the day before the president announced his support for same-sex unions.\n\nThursday's event is expected to draw comparisons to 2008, when Obama accepted the Democratic nomination before a capacity crowd at an 84,000-seat stadium in Denver. This time around, Obama's crowds are far smaller, with his largest audience being a 14,000-person crowd at his campaign kick-off rally in May at Ohio State University.\n\nThe campaign says the size of Obama's events this summer have been intentionally kept low, as large rallies are more expensive and security requirements are more intense for a sitting president than a candidate. Convention organizers in Charlotte may have more control over the crowds than their other big concern: the weather. Heavy evening rains doused Charlotte over the weekend, and thunderstorms are in the forecast for Thursday. Officials say the outdoor event will go on rain or shine, except in the case of severe weather.",
    " Title: Christie's Visit with President Obama: A Political Move or a Show of Unity?\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of political speculation, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's visit with President Barack Obama has left many questioning the governor's intentions. As the presidential race heats up, Christie's actions have been interpreted in various ways, from a selfless leader ensuring his state's interests are heard, to a potential presidential candidate positioning himself for 2016, or even a tactic to deter potential Democratic challengers.\n\nAs Obama praised Christie's leadership, Romney aides downplayed the partnership, with Kevin Madden, a Romney adviser, stating, \"He's a governor focused on his job. He has said he's not looking at this through the lens of politics. He's right, and I expect most folks are looking at it just like the governor is.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney also emphasized that the visit should not be viewed as a political event, stating, \"This is a time to focus on what was a devastating storm and the terrible aftermath of that storm.\"\n\nHowever, Christie did not entirely avoid politics, criticizing Democrats in the State Legislature and picking fights with the Democratic mayor of Atlantic City. His high approval ratings in New Jersey contrast with President Obama's, making a potential second term bid a possibility.\n\nDespite the political undertones, Christie's actions align with his straightforward approach, as stated by Mike DuHaime, an adviser to Christie, who said, \"He calls 'em as he sees 'em. If they're working well together, he's going to say it.\"\n\nChristie has yet to announce his plans for a second term, with the election just over a year away. His actions during this visit, and his response to the president's post-storm visit, have sparked debate about his political motives.\n\nAs the political landscape continues to evolve, Christie's visit with President Obama serves as a significant event, raising questions about the governor's future political aspirations and his relationship with the current administration.",
    " Title: 2020 Democratic Presidential Hopefuls to Address SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, several Democratic candidates are set to appear at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. The event, known for its focus on technology, film, and music, serves as an opportunity for the candidates to engage with young voters and showcase their policies on issues such as universal healthcare and the national deficit.\n\nSenators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will speak on Saturday, while former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, and Washington Governor Jay Inslee will address the crowd on Sunday. Former Texas Representative Beto O'Rourke, who ran for the Senate last year but has yet to announce his 2020 intentions, is expected to attend a film premiere about his longshot Senate bid against Senator Ted Cruz. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who is not a presidential contender but is a rising star within the party, is due to be interviewed onstage on Saturday night, according to the Guardian.\n\nTexas is an early primary state for Democrats, but it is a red state in the presidential election as a whole. However, O'Rourke's close race with Cruz suggests that the state could be shifting slowly toward being a purple state. The candidates' presence at SXSW also serves as an opportunity to connect with potential young voters who can provide support, volunteering, and social media engagement for their campaigns.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez told CBS News that events like SXSW provide real opportunities for the party ahead of the 2020 campaign. \"It's become an iconic national event, and I wanted to make sure people understood what we're doing at the Democratic Party to win,\" Perez said. He also cited the 2018 Texas Senate race as a sign that Texas could eventually be up for grabs for Democrats: \"Texas is very much in play for Democrats. We made tremendous progress.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Ruling Revives 1868 Treaty with Crow Tribe, Potentially Expanding Hunting Rights on Federal Lands\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark decision on Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that Wyoming cannot abrogate a 1868 treaty with the Crow Tribe, marking a significant shift in American Indian-U.S. relations. The ruling, which contradicts a century-old high court precedent, could potentially guarantee hunting rights for American Indians on some federal lands.\n\nThe case, brought by Crow Tribe member Clayvin Herrera, stemmed from a 2014 hunting incident in the Big Horn National Forest. Mr. Herrera, along with other tribe members, was charged by Wyoming authorities for offseason hunting, citing the treaty that guarantees American Indians the right to hunt on unoccupied lands of the United States as long as game may be found thereon.\n\nThe treaty was signed by Crow leaders in 1868, with the tribe ceding roughly 30 million acres to settlers while retaining about 8 million acres. Wyoming argued that the treaty expired when it gained statehood in 1890. However, in a 5-4 ruling, the justices sided with Mr. Herrera, stating that the treaty is still valid law.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote the court's 22-page opinion, argued that there is no evidence that Congress intended to abrogate the 1868 treaty with the Wyoming Statehood Act. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the treaty itself that Congress intended the hunting right to expire at statehood, or that the Crow Tribe would have understood it to do so.\n\nAdvocates for Mr. Herrera hailed the decision as a significant step forward, as it overrules the prior precedent and gives \"life\" to the rights of American Indians. Forrest Tahdooahnippah, a lawyer who specializes in tribal issues, stated that the decision provides \"life\" to the rights of American Indians by overruling the prior precedent.\n\nOne of the key issues for the justices was the treaty's language, which stated it applied to \"unoccupied lands.\" Wyoming argued that once it became a state, all of the lands were deemed occupied. The court, however, rejected both arguments, though it did leave room for some regulations within the forest, including where Wyoming decides it has an interest in conservation.\n\nThe four dissenting justices argued that the majority was ignoring a clear precedent, citing a similar case in 1895 involving the same treaty language and the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes. In that case, the justices ruled that the tribes' right to hunt was terminated when Wyoming gained statehood. The court then stated that if the tribe's rights didn't end, the state would lack the power to regulate the killing of game.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito called Monday's majority opinion \"wasted ink.\" The decision's implications for other tribes with similar treaties and hunting rights on federal lands remain to be seen.",
    " Title: New NAFTA Successor Requires Higher Automotive Content, Awaits Congressional Approval\n\nArticle:\n\nThe new rules for automakers under the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will require a higher percentage of a vehicle's content to be produced in North America to qualify for zero tariffs, increasing from the current 62.5 percent to 75 percent. However, the deal is yet to receive congressional ratification, and the changes may not significantly encourage investment in the United States, according to industry experts.\n\nKristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor, and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, stated that most vehicles would likely meet the new thresholds easily. She also noted that investment in the U.S. automotive industry might remain stagnant due to the unpredictability of President Trump's trade policies.\n\nEmployment in the auto industry has slightly increased under President Trump's administration, rising from approximately 955,800 in January 2017 to about one million in November 2018. However, the number of vehicles manufactured in the United States has continued to decline, despite a slight uptick last summer. According to the Reshoring Initiative, announcements to increase investment or move companies back to the United States peaked in 2016.\n\nPresident Trump has renegotiated NAFTA and a bilateral trade deal with South Korea. The changes to the South Korea agreement were modest, but the revised NAFTA strengthens intellectual property rights in Canada. The Trump administration has also imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese products in response to an investigation into China's trade practices, which allegedly included violations of American intellectual property rights. The two sides are currently in talks over a trade deal to resolve the dispute.\n\nIn a separate development, President Trump signed the \"Right to Try\" legislation into law in May, allowing terminally ill patients to seek access to experimental medicine that is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This legislation builds upon a similar program known as compassionate use or expanded access, which has been in place since the 1970s. The new law allows patients, with their doctor's approval, to ask drug companies directly for access, rather than waiting for approval by the agency.",
    " Title: Senate Overcomes Filibuster on Defense Policy Bill, Setting Stage for Presidential Veto Showdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant victory for Republicans, the Senate successfully overcame a filibuster on the annual defense policy bill on Tuesday, moving the bill closer to a potential showdown with President Obama, who has threatened to veto it. The bill, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, authorizes military spending, sets policy for Guantanamo Bay detainees, and addresses specific issues that have arisen since the previous bill.\n\nThe bill, if passed, would mark the fifth veto of President Obama's tenure. Republicans argue that an Obama veto would be equivalent to a surrender, given the popularity of the bill and the dangerous threats the military is currently facing overseas. A final vote is expected on Wednesday, and the bill will then be sent to the president's desk.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-AZ), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, expressed his disbelief at the prospect of a presidential veto, stating, \"I can not imagine a president of the United States vetoing a bill that authorizes the ability of Americans to defend this nation under these most challenging circumstances.\"\n\nIf President Obama follows through on his threat, it would provide the best opportunity yet for Congress to override him, requiring a two-thirds vote in each chamber. The Senate, which voted 73-26 on Tuesday to head off a filibuster, appears to have more than enough support. From the Democratic caucus, 21 members sided with Republicans.\n\nThe House, however, fell short of two-thirds support last week, with the bill receiving a vote of 270-156. Ten Republicans joined 146 Democrats in opposition, and many of them may face intense pressure to support an override.\n\nThe defense policy bill sets spending levels and rewrites rules for the Pentagon for the fiscal year. This year's version includes a Defense Department prod to determine whether those working at military recruitment centers can be armed, a response to the Navy recruitment center shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in July. It also protects popular weapons programs such as the A-10 aircraft and calls for new strike fighters for the Navy and Marine Corps, among other provisions.\n\nHowever, the bill has become ensnared in a broader fight over government spending for fiscal year 2016. Republicans want more money for the Defense Department and have proposed classifying some of it as emergency war spending, helping to circumvent the 2011 debt law's automatic \"sequester\" cuts. Democrats insist that if the Defense Department gets an increase, an equal amount must go toward domestic spending.\n\nDemocrats have filibustered the annual defense spending bill but are divided over whether to filibuster the policy bill. The White House has stated that the policy bill and the spending bill are closely linked, and a veto is likely if the bill includes an \"irresponsible way for funding our core national defense priorities.\"\n\nEven if the spending fight is resolved, the White House is troubled by the bill's restrictions on transferring detainees from the Guantanamo Bay facility to the U.S., as President Obama has promised to shutter the prison. The latest version of the defense policy bill bans transfers to Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, and imposes stricter certifications from the Defense Department's secretary before transfers are made to other countries.\n\nThe outcome of the defense policy bill's passage and the subsequent veto decision will likely depend on negotiations between the White House, Republican defense hawks, and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. The stakes are high, as both the President and Republican defense hawks agree that the Pentagon needs an additional $38 billion more than it would receive under the budget caps and sequester cuts, but Democrats insist on an equal allocation for health care, federal lands, and other domestic programs.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-OH) are reportedly in the middle of negotiations with the White House and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill about a big spending deal. However, Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has urged faster progress to avoid a series of deadlines over the debt limit and a potential government shutdown. He reiterated Democrats' insistence that the Defense Department will not receive a free pass, stating, \"If there's going to be increases for defense, there's going to be increases for non-defense.\"",

In his remarks, Trump emphasized the nation's resilience and pledged to keep the U.S. safe from future attacks.\n\n\"The terrorists who attacked us thought they could incite fear and weaken our spirit. But America cannot be intimidated, and those who try will soon join the long list of vanquished enemies who dared to test our mettle,\" Trump said Monday morning.\n\nThe president, who recently announced his administration's strategy for the long-running conflict in Afghanistan, which began in 2001 as a hunt for the organizers of the Sept. 11 attacks, warned that \"we are making plain to these savage killers that there is no dark corner beyond our reach. No sanctuary beyond our grasp, and nowhere to hide anywhere on this very large Earth.\"\n\nTrump also shared the story of a Pentagon police officer who rushed into the wreckage of the Pentagon and saved \"as many as 20 people\" over his nearly 36 hours working at the site. The attacks against the U.S., the president said, made the nation more resilient and continue to do so.\n\nGen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary James Mattis preceded the president in their remarks, declaring that \"Americans are not made of cotton candy, we're not seaweed drifting in the current, we are not intimidated by our enemies.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence also paid tribute to the passengers of United Airlines Flight 93, who fought against hijackers on 9/11. Speaking in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, Pence said, \"I and many others in our nation's capital were able to go home that day to hug our families because of the courage and selflessness of the heroes of Flight 93.\"\n\nEarlier Monday, the president and first lady Melania Trump observed a moment of silence on the South Lawn of the White House. The president and first lady stood with their hands over their hearts as a bell tolled at 8:46 a.m. and a Marine bugler played \"Taps.\" The president and first lady were joined by his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both of whom serve as advisers to the president. Other administration staff members present included Chief of Staff John Kelly, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, Economic Adviser Gary Cohn, White House Counsel Don McGahn, Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell, and Communications Director Hope Hicks.\n\nTrump offered no remarks during the brief White House event.",
    " Title: Sondland Testimony: Ambassador's Account of Conversation with Trump Does Not Exonerate President Trump, According to House Intelligence Committee Chairman\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday did not exonerate the President, according to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before departing on a scheduled trip to Texas, President Trump claimed that Sondland's testimony meant \"it's all over\" for the proceedings and that the House inquiry into Trump should come to a halt. However, Sondland's testimony provided a more nuanced account of a conversation with Trump where he asked the President what he wanted from Ukraine.\n\nSondland testified that during the conversation, Trump said, \"I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.\" This statement, according to Trump, proves there was no quid pro quo between his administration and Ukraine, the matter at the heart of the impeachment probe.\n\nHowever, Sondland confirmed he never heard directly from Trump on a quid pro quo linking military aid for Ukraine to politically advantageous investigations. He did, however, confirm that a meeting at the White House for Ukraine's president and a phone call with Trump would happen only if President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to an investigation into the 2016 U.S. election and the Bidens. Sondland also said he came to presume aid was linked to investigations too.\n\nSondland testified that he sent an email on July 19, just days before the July 25 call at the center of the impeachment inquiry, where he laid out the issue in detail to members of the State and Energy departments and White House staff. Sondland also testified later that he worked with Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukraine at Trump's \"express direction\" and pushed a \"quid pro quo\" with Kiev because it was what Trump wanted.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff called Sondland's testimony \"a very important moment in the history of this investigation\" and said it showed \"for the first time that knowledge of this scheme was pervasive.\" Schiff's comments suggest that Sondland's testimony has provided evidence that supports the impeachment inquiry against President Trump.",
    " Title: Fourth Explosion Rocks Austin: Police Investigate Possible Link to Series of Package Bombs\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, another explosion occurred in Austin, Texas on Sunday night, injuring two people on bicycles. The incident, which is being investigated as a possible link to a series of package bombings that have gripped the city in fear, has left authorities scrambling to determine the cause and potential connection.\n\nThe latest blast took place around 8:30 p.m. in the suburban neighborhood of Travis Country. Initial investigations suggest the explosion may have been triggered by a trip wire, a detail that Austin Police Chief Brian Manley described as showing a \"different level of skill\" compared to the previous explosions.\n\nAt a hastily-arranged news conference, Manley stated, \"If this explosion was the result of a bomb using trip wire technology, that is showing a different level of skill above that we were already concerned that this suspect or suspects may possess.\" He added that the blast was \"activated by someone either handling, kicking or coming into contact with a trip wire that activated the device\" as they walked or rode their bikes through the area.\n\nManley also noted that the safety message previously issued, advising communities not to handle, pick up, or disturb packages, may need to be revised in light of the new information. He stated, \"Our safety message to this point has been involving the handling of packages and telling communities 'do not handle packages, do not pick up packages, do not disturb packages,' but this changes things.\"\n\nAuthorities are currently working under the belief that the explosion is related to the three previous incidents, but they have yet to process the entire scene. Manley stated, \"We are working under the belief that they are connected.\"\n\nThe two men in their 20s who were injured in the blast are reportedly in good condition, with one having nails in his leg. The area within a half-mile radius has been cordoned off, and authorities have urged residents to stay indoors until the scene is properly cleared.\n\nThis is the fourth explosion to rock Austin in less than three weeks. The first three occurred on the east side of the city, with the most recent being on March 12, resulting in the death of 17-year-old Draylen Mason, the wounding of his mother, and the injury of a 75-year-old woman.\n\nThe reward for information leading to an arrest in the deadly explosions has risen to $115,000, with over 500 officers, including federal agents, conducting 236 interviews and following up on 435 leads. The community remains on high alert as the investigation continues.",
    " Title: Indicted Roger Stone Mocks Mueller, Calls Charges \"Nothingburger\" on Social Media\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A day after being indicted, Roger Stone, a longtime political consultant and adviser to President Donald Trump, used his Instagram account to mock special counsel Robert Mueller and dub the charges against him as a big \"nothingburger.\"\n\n\"Here\u2019s what Mueller has on me # nothingburger,\" Stone posted on Saturday, accompanying the statement with a doctored image of Mueller dressed up as a waiter holding an empty bun on a silver platter.\n\nStone, known for his controversial and sometimes bizarre social media posts, posted a photo of himself with the words \"Who framed Roger Stone,\" a play on the 1988 movie \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" after being arrested on Friday.\n\nStone was indicted on charges of lying about his role in Russian meddling during the 2016 election designed to benefit Trump's campaign. The indictment, which was unsealed on Friday, lays out investigators' understanding of efforts by the Trump campaign to learn about the website WikiLeaks' plans to release damaging information about Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, which was allegedly stolen by Russian intelligence seeking to influence the election on Trump's behalf.\n\nThe allegations revolve around Stone's alleged contacts with WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign. He is accused of lying about his contacts with WikiLeaks, including dealings with website founder Julian Assange, as well as interactions with members of the Trump campaign about stolen emails.\n\n\"During the summer of 2016, Stone spoke to senior Trump Campaign officials about Organization 1 and information it might have had that would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign,\" the indictment said. \"Stone was contacted by senior Trump Campaign officials to inquire about future releases by Organization 1.\"\n\nStone has repeatedly said he is innocent and that Mueller is conducting a vendetta against him and the president. After he was released on bail, Stone spoke outside a federal courthouse in Florida, then made appearances on CNN and Fox News to denounce the charges and boast that he would never testify against the president.",
    " Title: Carly Fiorina Addresses Poll Slump, Campaign Strategy in South Carolina\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address her declining poll numbers and perceived waning interest in her campaign, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina on Friday offered a political analysis of her campaign's financial management and strategy.\n\nSpeaking to reporters following an address to a senior community in Bluffton, S.C., Fiorina addressed reports of Jeb Bush scaling back his campaign by highlighting her campaign's \"lowest burn rate\" among all candidates. She emphasized, \"We are spending our money very carefully because we have to go the long haul.\"\n\nThe strategy of not investing in advertising has been questioned, given the momentum Fiorina gained following her strong performance in the first Republican debate. When asked about her plans for advertising, she responded, \"Well, not for a while. I think we have spent our time between the efforts of the campaign, and what I understand the'super PAC' Carly Fiorina is doing, we have spent our time making sure we have people on the ground.\"\n\nFiorina added, \"Of course, I take advantage of earned media any chance I get. The debates are a really important opportunity for me. Every time I get out on that debate stage, more people say 'Oh, I didn't know she was running for president. I kind of like her.' So there will come a time for ads, but honestly, other candidates have already spent millions on ads, and it's done nothing for them. So I think the time is not yet.\"\n\nAddressing the dip in her poll numbers, Fiorina argued that it was not a result of attacks on her business record. \"If the attacks were working, you'd start to see it in my favorable and unfavorables,\" she said, referring to poll data. \"And in fact, I have very, very strong fave and unfave ratings. I think what you are seeing is that in the debate, half the audience saw me for the first time. You don't make a sale in one impression. Also, we have been off national television for the last couple of weeks. We have been doing more regional media and more on-the-ground town halls.\"\n\n\"So I think you have to look at not every little bump in a poll\u2014you have to look at a trajectory,\" Fiorina concluded.",
    " Title: Poll Reveals Shift in Democratic Party's Stance on Gun Control, Raising Concerns Among Gun Rights Advocates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the issue of gun control has once again taken center stage in American politics. A recent poll by YouGov has sparked controversy and raised concerns among gun rights advocates, as it shows a significant majority of Democrats support banning semiautomatic firearms.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted in the wake of the Parkland shooting, revealed that 82 percent of Democrats want to ban semiautomatic firearms, while they are evenly split on a total handgun ban. This has led to accusations that the Democratic Party is seeking to \"shred the Second Amendment\" and impose Australian-style gun bans, as almost the entire party wants to restrict firearms in America.\n\nThe poll has been met with criticism from gun rights advocates, who argue that the Democratic Party's stance on gun control is not only extreme but also based on a lack of understanding of firearms and their function. Critics point out that the media's portrayal of firearms is often inaccurate, with terms like \"assault weapon\" and \"full semi-automatic\" being used interchangeably and incorrectly.\n\nLois Beckett, a journalist covering gun politics, has called on pollsters to survey Americans on their understanding of the basic terms of the gun control debate. She has questioned the accuracy of the poll's findings, suggesting that respondents may not fully understand what they are supporting when they say they want to ban \"semi-automatic rifles.\"\n\nThe poll's findings have sparked a heated debate among politicians and gun rights advocates, with some arguing that the Democratic Party's stance on gun control is a threat to the Second Amendment and the civil right to own firearms. Others argue that the poll's findings are skewed and that the Democratic Party's support for gun control is not as strong as the poll suggests.\n\nRegardless of one's political leanings, the poll's findings highlight the need for greater education and understanding of firearms and their function. As the debate over gun control continues, it is essential that Americans are informed and that the terms used in the debate are accurately defined and understood.",
    " Title: White House Opens to Possibility of Different Explanations for Benghazi Attack as Investigation Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo days after the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, described the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya as a \"spontaneous\" reaction to protests, the White House has opened the door to the possibility of other explanations.\n\nIn a press briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stated, \"We have provided information about what we believe was the precipitating cause of the protest and violence based on the information that we have had available. The FBI is investigating, and that investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead.\"\n\nCarney also noted, \"We do not have any indication at this point of premeditation or pre-planned attacks,\" but added, \"we're not making declarations ahead of the facts here.\"\n\nIn contrast to Rice's account, Carney did not provide a detailed explanation of the administration's beliefs about the attack. This apparent acknowledgment that the investigation could offer a different version of events comes as conflicting accounts emerge.\n\nRice, in interviews on several Sunday shows, stated that the administration believes the attack was not \"preplanned\" or \"premeditated.\" Instead, she said, it was a \"spontaneous\" reaction to protests in Egypt over an anti-Islam film, and extremist elements \"joined the fray\" before it \"spun out of control.\"\n\nHowever, these accounts clash with claims by the Libyan president that the attack was in fact premeditated. Other sources, including an intelligence source in Libya who spoke to Fox News, have echoed those claims. The intelligence source even said that, contrary to the suggestion by the Obama administration, there was no major protest in Benghazi before the deadly attack which killed four Americans. A U.S. official did not dispute the claim.\n\nIn the face of these conflicting accounts, Carney on Tuesday deferred to the ongoing investigation. \"It is an absolute tragedy that we lost four Americans in Benghazi,\" he said. \"There is an active investigation under way about what happened and why and what the motivations were.\"\n\nThe ongoing investigation will examine \"what role the video played\" in the attack, among other things, according to Carney. The assault on the consulate came without warning and included RPGs and mortars, according to Fox News' reporting.\n\nThe account relayed by the intelligence source on the ground in Libya is consistent with statements by the Libyan president that the attack was pre-mediated and the work of foreign fighters, which is code for Islamist extremists, including the Al Qaeda affiliate in North Africa. It is also consistent with an interview by McClatchy Newspapers with a purported Libyan security guard who was injured in the assault. The guard said the consulate area was quiet and \"there was not a single ant outside\" until dozens of armed men descended on the compound.\n\nEven before Ambassador Stevens' murder, U.S. officials say the CIA determined the security situation in eastern Libya was deteriorating based on four attacks, beginning in June, on diplomatic and Western targets in Benghazi, including the U.S. Consulate. That said, U.S. officials insist there was no specific warning of an armed assault, like the one that killed the four Americans.",
    " Title: Washington and Lee University Faculty Votes to Remove Robert E. Lee's Name, Following a Trend of Confederate Symbol Removal in Virginia Schools\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant decision, the faculty of Washington and Lee University voted overwhelmingly on Monday to remove the name of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from the Virginia institution. The faculty, which had initially added Lee's name in 1870, following his death, passed the resolution to remove his name with a vote of 188-51. A proposed motion to remove George Washington's name, however, failed.\n\nAlison Bell, head of the Faculty Affairs Committee, stated, \"Robert E. Lee, who had served as the college's president after the Civil War, was a symbol of who the faculty wanted to be, and who they are. The faculty is 150 years later, asking the university for a name change because Lee does not represent who we are and who we want to be.\"\n\nThe student government of Washington and Lee University formally requested the removal of Lee's name last week, and over 200 faculty members had signed a petition with the same objective. The board of trustees, which would have to approve the name change, is \"carefully monitoring developments regarding issues of race, monuments, and symbols of the Confederacy and their implications\" for Washington and Lee, a spokeswoman said last week.\n\nElsewhere in Virginia, Confederate names are being removed from public K-12 schools at a rapid pace, according to The Washington Post. Stonewall Middle School in Prince William County is set to receive a new name, as is Robert E. Lee High School, one of the most diverse schools in Fairfax County. Loudon County High School is also getting a new mascot after the school board voted unanimously to drop the Raiders, a reference to Confederate Col. John S. Mosby\u2019s guerrilla troops.\n\nHistorians said the wholesale rejection of Confederate iconography by Virginia schools is unprecedented, reported The Washington Post. James Grossman at the American Historical Association noted that Black students, parents, and communities have objected since the schools were named in the 1950s and '60s, in an angry backlash to the Supreme Court's seminal ruling in Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nHistorian Adam Domby stated, \"It was trying to make black students feel unwelcome, while white students and white communities were emboldened to resist desegregation.\" The removal of these symbols is part of a broader movement to address racial inequalities and promote inclusivity in education.",
    " Title: Jay Sekulow Critiques Robert Mueller's Testimony, Calls it a \"Waste of Taxpayer Money\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of former special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony on Capitol Hill, Jay Sekulow, one of President Donald Trump's attorneys, has criticized the investigation and Mueller's performance during the hearing. In an interview with Fox News' \"Fox and Friends\" on Thursday, Sekulow described the investigation as a \"terrible, terrible waste of taxpayer money.\"\n\nSekulow argued that the investigation, which has been referred to by the president as a \"witch hunt,\" was not what was expected during Mueller's testimony. He stated that the investigation's architect, Mueller, was put on the stand, and the general consensus among commentators was that the testimony was a \"disaster,\" \"train wreck,\" or \"horrible.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi attempted to maintain a positive demeanor during her press conference on Wednesday, but Sekulow noted that even members of the Democratic Party recognized the hearing as a \"train wreck.\"\n\nSekulow pointed out that there were 12-13 prosecutors who worked tirelessly to create a collusion, conspiracy, and obstruction narrative, but despite their efforts, they were unable to establish these narratives.\n\nOne of the most significant issues, according to Sekulow, was when Mueller was asked about the exoneration policy he put forward. When asked if there was any historical precedent for this policy, Mueller responded that there was not. Sekulow argued that this indicates that the president is being treated differently than any other citizen in terms of the burden of proof.\n\nRegarding the individuals arrested during the investigation, Sekulow stated that there has been no discussion, as far as he knows, concerning potential pardons. However, he emphasized that there has been a lot of injustice in the case.",
    " Title: Deadly 7.8-Magnitude Earthquake Strikes Nepal, Triggering Avalanches and Devastating Tourist Attractions\n\nArticle:\n\nA devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit Nepal over the weekend, resulting in at least 4,400 deaths and over 8,000 injuries, according to Associated Press reporters Binaj Gurubacharya and Katy Daigle. The earthquake caused avalanches at Mount Everest base camp, resulting in at least 18 fatalities. The majority of the casualties occurred in Nepal, but there are reports of victims in India, Bangladesh, and along the Nepal-China border.\n\nThe iconic Dharahara Tower, a historical landmark in Kathmandu built in 1832 and recognized by UNESCO, collapsed in the quake. Hundreds of people reportedly bought tickets to ascend to the top of the watchtower on weekends.\n\nThe full extent of the damage from the quake, which struck around noon, is still unknown as rescue workers continue to navigate through the rubble, particularly in the heavily populated Kathmandu Valley, where building quality is often low. Home Ministry official Laxmi Dhakal has stated that the death toll will likely rise.\n\nFurther earthquakes and aftershocks have complicated rescue operations. \"There have been nearly 100 earthquakes and aftershocks, which is making rescue work difficult,\" Kathmandu district chief administrator Ek Narayan Aryal told the Associated Press. \"Even the rescuers are scared and running because of them.\"\n\nThe initial earthquake was considerably more powerful than the one that devastated Haiti in 2010, and the same magnitude as the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco. However, it falls below Nepal's worst recorded earthquake in 1934, which measured at 8.0 and ravaged the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Patan.\n\nGerman climber Jost Kobusch shared harrowing footage of an avalanche that reportedly hit a Mount Everest base camp in the aftermath of the initial earthquake. In the video, someone says, \"The ground is shaking,\" before a wall of snow overwhelms a camp with dozens of tents. Two people are shown taking cover from the avalanche as they are pelted by ice and snow. They then walk around, showing the remains of the leveled camp.\n\nAvalanches killed at least 18 people and injured at least 61 more in Nepal over the weekend, according to the Associated Press's Gurubacharya and Daigle. However, Kobusch survived, according to CNN.\n\nBeyond the toll on human life, disasters like this earthquake put a significant strain on impoverished countries like Nepal. The South Asian country's economy heavily relies on tourism from trekkers and mountain climbers, many of whom are attracted to Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world.\n\nExperts had warned of a potentially tragic earthquake in Nepal a week before it occurred. A group of about 50 earthquake and social scientists from around the world had gathered in Kathmandu, Nepal, a week prior to figure out how to better prepare the area for a large earthquake, similar to the 1934 temblor that leveled the city. Seismologist James Jackson, head of the earth sciences department at the University of Cambridge in England, told the Associated Press that he did not expect such a massive earthquake to hit so soon, but experts were warning that something like it was possible.\n\nNot only is Nepal situated on a natural seismic fault, but local infrastructure is so poorly built to resist earthquakes that the tremors can lead to far more casualties than they would in other parts of the world. US Geological Survey seismologist David Wald estimated to the Associated Press that the same level of severe shaking would lead to 10 to 30 deaths per million residents in California but kill 1,000 or more in Nepal and up to 10,000 in parts of Pakistan, India, Iran, and China.\n\n\"They knew they had a problem,\" Hari Kumar, southeast Asia regional coordinator for GeoHazards International, which works on global earthquake risks, told the Associated Press. \"But it was so large they didn't know where to start, how to start.\"",
    " Title: Thousands of Young Illegal Immigrants Line Up for Obama's Deferred Action Program\n\nArticle:\n\nAs of Wednesday, young illegal immigrants have been flocking to consulates nationwide to apply for the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The program, which is akin to the stalled DREAM Act, offers eligible individuals a two-year reprieve from deportation.\n\nAccording to estimates, as many as 1.8 million undocumented immigrants could potentially qualify for the program. To apply, individuals must fill out a six-page form, pay a $465 fee, and submit documents verifying their identity. Applicants must demonstrate that they arrived in the U.S. before their 16th birthday and are either enrolled in school or vocational training, have a high school diploma or GED, or are military veterans.\n\nOn Tuesday, lines formed outside consulates as individuals sought to secure their passport applications in anticipation of the program's launch. Kristi Alarcon, an applicant, told MyFoxHouston, \"We are waiting for our passports. We want to get our passport because Obama might be asking for them.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles, advocates held workshops on Wednesday to guide applicants through the application process. The turnout on Tuesday and Wednesday serves as the most visible demonstration to date of the interest in the administration's new reprieve program.\n\nThe requirements for the DACA program are less stringent than those of the original DREAM Act. Applicants must be in school, have a high school diploma or GED, or be a military veteran. They cannot have a felony record, but a record with fewer than three minor misdemeanors is not disqualifying. Under the DREAM Act, applicants not only had to show a high school diploma or GED but also had to demonstrate, after a six-year period, that they had attended college or served in the military for at least two years.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have criticized the program, accusing the Obama administration of circumventing Congress and favoring illegal immigrants over unemployed U.S. citizens. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, has referred to the policy as a \"backdoor amnesty\" and expressed concerns about fraud.\n\n\"While potentially millions of illegal immigrants will be permitted to compete with American workers for scarce jobs, there seems to be little if any mechanism in place for vetting fraudulent applications and documentation submitted by illegal immigrants,\" Smith said Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Homeland Security announced the details of the documents required to prove eligibility for the DACA program. The program's implementation comes just months before the upcoming White House race, in which the Hispanic vote may play a significant role.\n\nObama has faced criticism from Hispanic voters and others for not fulfilling a previous campaign promise to overhaul the nation's immigration laws.",
    " Title: GOP and Democrats Prepare for Potential Runoff Scenarios in Louisiana and Georgia\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the November elections, both the Republican and Democratic parties are strategizing for potential runoff scenarios in Louisiana and Georgia. The key Senate races in these states could determine the control of the Senate, with Republicans holding back funds in anticipation of a post-Election Day fight.\n\nIn Louisiana, if Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu does not secure more than half the vote in the general election, she would likely face a one-on-one runoff with Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy. Similarly, in Georgia, both parties are preparing for a potential nine-week runoff ending in January, should the race not be decided on Election Day.\n\nSen. Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican who battled in his own runoff race in 1996, described the period as \"a very intense time.\" He emphasized the importance of recapitalizing and mobilizing voters immediately after the election.\n\nThe specter of runoffs in key states is forcing parties to make a critical choice: spend resources now or conserve them for a potential winter campaign. Operatives are already gaming out the runoff scenario, particularly in Louisiana, where plans include sending in lawyers and maintaining get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nIn Georgia, both sides have built an infrastructure they plan to rely on if the race goes to a runoff. They are already predicting a major fundraising blitz if the winner isn't decided on election night.\n\nRepublicans have made concrete plans, with the National Republican Senatorial Committee reserving $3.4 million in TV time for the Louisiana runoff, while the conservative outside group Freedom Partners has booked an additional $1.5 million for a potential post-Election Day affair. Karl Rove-backed Crossroads GPS has $2.1 million reserved in the state starting Oct. 7.\n\nDemocrats have yet to reserve airtime in Louisiana, and both sides are staying off the air for the runoff in Georgia\u2014for now. In Louisiana, Democrats believe their best shot at winning the race is to secure a majority in November, taking advantage of a split between Cassidy and his main conservative opponent, tea party challenger Rob Maness.\n\nIf a runoff occurs, Cassidy, Landrieu's main opponent, plans to consolidate GOP support behind his candidacy by focusing on President Barack Obama. Landrieu, on the other hand, remains confident about her chances of securing 50% of the vote in the first election.\n\nBoth parties are tight-lipped about their runoff plans, with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Louisiana Democratic Party Executive Director Stephen Handwerk declining to discuss their strategies. However, the strategic preparations in two key states suggest a prolonged fight and a potential photo finish.",
    " Title: President Obama to Deliver Economic Speech at Knox College, Focusing on Middle Class and Budget Deadlines\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a renewed focus on the economy, President Barack Obama will deliver a speech at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois on Wednesday. This address marks the beginning of a series of economic speeches the White House plans to deliver over the next several weeks, ahead of key budget deadlines in the fall.\n\nThe speech comes just a week before Congress is scheduled to go on its month-long August recess. The aim is to build public pressure on lawmakers in an attempt to avoid the tax and spending showdowns that have characterized past budget debates.\n\nThe upcoming fiscal year begins in October, and the government is expected to reach its borrowing limit soon. The speech is designed to remind Americans of the economy's condition when Obama took office and its comparative stability now.\n\nMonday's speech is not expected to deviate significantly from previous economic speeches. The president is likely to reiterate his calls for more green energy, investment in infrastructure, the importance of the middle class, and the need for the wealthy to pay their fair share. After Knox College, Obama will move on to Missouri and Florida to deliver similar messages.\n\nOne of the key issues to watch will be how Obama sells the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) as part of an overall better economy. Last week, when he spoke on the topic of healthcare, the Associated Press fact-checker called Obama out for exaggerating the benefits of his signature healthcare legislation.\n\nAnother issue to watch is how Obama will handle his approach to Republicans who refuse to vote for an increase in the debt ceiling without the defunding of Obamacare in return. Congress has just a few weeks to reach a deal.\n\nHowever, it's possible that today's speech may not be solely about the economy. RealClearPolitics suggests that Obama may be starting to think more about his legacy and how he will be viewed in history. Speeches are a good way to leave a lasting mark, after all, while sifting through old unemployment data is not as exciting.\n\nThe speech is scheduled for 12:55 ET and will be streamed live at WhiteHouse.gov.",
    " Title: Former Chinese Censor Claims TikTok Interviewed Him for Role in Monitoring and Policing US Users\n\nA former Chinese internet censor, Liu Lipeng, has claimed that he was interviewed for a role in monitoring and policing videos posted by international users of TikTok, a Chinese-owned short video app used by millions of Americans.\n\nLiu, who worked as an online censor in China for a decade, said he was passed over for the job in 2018 after suggesting during the interview that TikTok should not overly censor content because Americans value freedom of speech. He described TikTok's parent company ByteDance Technology Co. as \"the largest and most terrifying censorship machine\" he has ever seen.\n\nLiu's claims coincide with rising public concerns over TikTok's ties to the Chinese regime, and come as the Trump administration considers banning the app over national security risks. U.S. officials and experts have sounded the alarm that the app could be used to spy on and censor American users.\n\nLiu, who built his career as a \"content reviewer\" for popular Chinese media apps Weibo and Leshi, said he was not asked only to monitor content inside China's walled-off internet. He said he interviewed with ByteDance on Oct. 18, 2018, for a content manager position that would inspect \"globalized videos\" on TikTok, according to the job recruitment notice.\n\nLiu, who moved with his family to the United States in March, described the interview experience as \"ridiculous\" -- the firm took extreme measures to ensure secrecy, which baffled him at the time. A ByteDance staff member was waiting for Liu as he arrived at the company's office in Tianjin and \"took him to walk in circles\" inside the building. The employee also instructed him not to look around.\n\n\"I won't be able to find it [ the ByteDance office ] if I go there now,\" he said, adding that there were surveillance cameras monitoring the workers to make sure they wouldn't remove any materials from the site. He estimated that the ByteDance facility housed at least 4,000 employees at the time, with a portion of the staff working on TikTok.\n\nLiu said the level of secrecy puzzled him, until he realized the purpose of the role for which he was interviewing. \"They are directly censoring Americans' speech,\" he said. The ByteDance staff \"have gone through over a decade of the Chinese Communist Party's [CCP] political indoctrination... people who are scared out of their wits by the CCP and live in fear.\"\n\nDuring the job interview, Liu expressed a different vision for the role. Having previously lived abroad for a number of years, Liu said he told the interviewer, \"I understand more about how much Americans care about freedom of speech, and therefore, we shouldn't overregulate.\" Liu was ultimately rejected because of those views, he believes.\n\nTikTok didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The app has previously said it doesn't use Chinese moderators to handle content on TikTok. In March, the company announced it would open a \"transparency center\" in Los Angeles to allow outside experts to see how TikTok moderates content.\n\nLiu says being in the United States means that he needs to defend U.S. interests and there's \"no turning back,\" he said. \"We [were] doing the dirtiest work, with police's guns behind our backs,\" he said, noting that the CCP's censorship apparatus has ballooned and become more restrictive over the past decade.\n\nParty membership wasn't mandatory when he first entered the trade, and hiring was conducted furtively, he said. These days, recruitment is out in the open, while one of the main qualifications is to have strong \"political awareness.\" He noted that posts with CCP-endorsed ideologies, such as patriotism and socialism, are allowed to stay on the platform.\n\nThe recruiters also target college graduates whose world views have been shaped by years of the regime's brainwashing education, according to Liu. This new generation of recruits have a tendency to zealously over-censor, and even have to be trained on \"how not to delete mindlessly,\" he said.\n\nThis isn't the first time TikTok has drawn scrutiny for imposing Beijing-style censorship on overseas users. Recently, TikTok closed the account of a Chinese international student in New Jersey after he posted a video spoofing the Chinese national anthem. The company came under fire last December for suspending the account of a U.S. teen who posted a video criticizing Beijing's suppression of Uyghur Muslims in China's far-western Xinjiang region.\n\nIn September 2019, The Guardian reported that TikTok instructed its moderators to censor certain videos that mention topics considered taboo by the Chinese regime, such as the Tiananmen Square Massacre and Falun Gong, a spiritual practice that has been severely persecuted in China since 1999. The report was based on leaked documents detailing the app's moderation guidelines.\n\nTikTok, in its response at the time, said that such policies were replaced in May 2019 and are no longer in use. A U.S. review panel is currently probing ByteDance's $1 billion acquisition of U.S. social media app Musical.ly--which was rebranded to TikTok--in 2017. It is investigating whether the deal raised national security risks.\n\nThe Pentagon last year ordered U.S. military personnel to delete TikTok from their work phones. Wells Fargo recently followed suit, while the Democratic and Republican National Committees have warned staff members about using the app. Following India's recent decision to ban TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps, the Trump administration confirmed that it was also considering a similar move. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said on July 15 that a number of administration officials were \"looking at the national security risk as it relates to TikTok, WeChat, and other apps.\" \"I don't think there's any self-imposed deadline for action, but I think we are looking at weeks, not months,\" Meadows said.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates Address Economic Inequality and Social Policies in America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, several candidates have highlighted the growing economic inequality in America and called for systemic reforms to address the issue.\n\nOne candidate, in a statement, expressed concern over the declining American Dream, citing increased farm bankruptcies, contaminated water supplies, and rising opioid deaths across the country. The candidate argued that 78% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and that the current economic system is not working for the majority of the population.\n\nTo address this issue, the candidate proposed a plan to rewrite the rules of the 21st-century economy. This plan includes rewriting the tax code to ensure that big corporations pay their fair share in taxes, and using the resulting funds to reinvest in the American people. The candidate also proposed the implementation of a \"Freedom Dividend,\" which would provide $1,000 a month to every American adult over 18, with no questions asked.\n\nAnother candidate emphasized the importance of education and job training programs, particularly community colleges, to prepare students for employment and align curricula with the skills that lead to good jobs. The candidate also proposed extending the earned income tax credit and unemployment insurance to Americans in training programs, to help them cover living expenses while they are investing in their future.\n\nBoth candidates agreed that low unemployment is not enough, and that a strong labor market should be the start of good social policy, not the end. They called for attention to be paid to social problems such as child care, health care, college costs, and environmental protection, which cannot be solved by a \"good economy\" alone.\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing tension between the United States and Iran has raised concerns about the potential for a new war. Some experts have questioned the strategic value of the recent assassination of Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani, and have expressed doubts about the Trump administration's ability to manage the resulting conflict.\n\nIn a related development, influential Republican senators have called on President Trump to avoid stumbling further into war with Iran, and to keep his promise to keep America out of foreign quagmires. The senators have warned that the president cannot keep an entire region from crossing his red line, making violent conflict all the more likely if the president holds to it.\n\nIn conclusion, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have put forth a range of proposals to address economic inequality and social problems in America, while also expressing concerns about the potential for a new war with Iran. The candidates have called for a rethinking of the fundamentals of economic and social policies, and for a focus on wage levels and the prosperity of the American people.",
    " Title: National Debt Surpasses $22 Trillion Under Trump Administration, Contrasting Early Campaign Promises\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Treasury Department reported Tuesday that the national debt has reached an unprecedented $22.012 trillion, marking the first time it has surpassed the $21 trillion mark in history. This figure represents a $2.065 trillion increase since President Donald Trump took office in 2017, when the national debt was $19.947 trillion.\n\nThe report, part of the department's fiscal statement, highlights the total public debt, which has been on a steady rise due to factors such as the growth of Medicare and Social Security costs, as well as the trillion-dollar deficit resulting from the tax cuts enacted in 2017, primarily benefiting corporations and the wealthy.\n\nDuring his 2015 campaign, Trump had promised to reduce the national debt, stating he would \"reduce our $18 trillion in debt\" if elected president. In his campaign launch address, he expressed his intention to \"bring back the American dream\" and make the country great again. However, his administration's fiscal policies have not followed this trajectory.\n\nIn December 2015, Trump stated he would \"freeze the budget,\" a promise that has not been fulfilled. In March 2016, he told The Washington Post that he could eliminate the debt \"fairly quickly.\" When pressed, he suggested it could be achieved over an eight-year period.\n\nTrump also asserted during the second presidential debate in October 2016 that he would bring back energy companies, which would pay off the national debt. This has not transpired to date.\n\nSince his inauguration, Trump has suggested that tariffs would enable him to start paying down the then-$21 trillion debt. However, the ongoing trade war resulting from these tariffs has negatively impacted American farmers, with the agricultural industry uncertain about the potential benefits of negotiations with countries like China, a major buyer of U.S. soybeans.\n\nThe Trump administration's budget proposals have not focused on reducing the debt. In fact, the last budget proposal the administration released was projected to add $7.2 trillion more to the debt over the next 10 years.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump frequently criticized President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for increasing the debt, alleging their past policies had added $9 trillion. Since taking office, Trump has been less vocal about the debt, mentioning it only a handful of times on Twitter.\n\nTrump's economic growth period, which began when he took office, has not led to a significant reduction in the national debt as he had promised. His first joint address to Congress and subsequent State of the Union addresses did not mention the debt, the budgetary deficit, or any fiscal policy. Last year, Trump's budget director and current chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, dismissed his boss's budget promises as \"hyperbole.\"",
    " Title: Obama Blames Outspending by Republicans for Walker's Recall Election Victory in Wisconsin\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a possible indication of a perceived significant impact, President Barack Obama on Wednesday attributed the survival of Governor Scott Walker in the union-driven recall election in Wisconsin on Tuesday to the Republicans' outspending Democrats in the state.\n\nWalker, who defeated Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett in a repeat of their 2010 contest, suggested that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney should consider Wisconsin as a competitive state in the general election.\n\n\"Anyone looking at the results last night would also acknowledge that it's now competitive in Wisconsin,\" Walker told MSNBC on Wednesday.\n\nThe state has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1984, but Walker stated that while Romney \"is an underdog,\" he can compete if he presents a bold platform.\n\nThe central issue before Wisconsin voters was whether Walker and the Republican state legislature were correct in breaking the public employees unions' grip on setting members' taxpayer-funded salaries and benefits, a move the GOP argued was necessary to address unsustainable liabilities, a problem many other states also face.\n\nThrough his spokesman Jay Carney, the president expressed his view that the fight was unfair because the Republicans outraised and outspent the Democrats in the state, using corporate and out-of-state money to do so.\n\n\"What you had was an incumbent governor in a repeat election that he had won once, in which he outspent his challenger by a magnitude of 7- or 8-to-1, with an enormous amount of outside corporate money and huge donations, and you got essentially the same result,\" said Carney, whose boss won the 2008 presidential election while shattering fundraising records and far outspending Republican John McCain.\n\nWalker had first won the governorship on a union-taming platform in 2010, by a 4-percentage-point margin. Republicans saw encouragement in Tuesday's 7-point margin, which could indicate a growing unease with Democrats' ties to unions.\n\nHowever, whether the Walker win signals a nationwide trend of disillusionment with union power is unclear. Ohio Governor John Kasich fought to keep his promise to help balance the state's budget by signing a law stripping collective bargaining rights from public employees. Ohio voters repealed the law in a referendum by a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nIn Wisconsin on Tuesday, a union-backed Democrat unseated a state senator in another recall election, which will switch control of the chamber to the Democrats.\n\nDespite the Walker win, the outcome of the election has put a temporary smile on Republicans' faces.\n\n\"Republicans walk away with a boatload of enthusiasm and momentum from last night's win in Wisconsin,\" Bill Palatucci, the New Jersey Republican National Committee member, told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Wednesday.\n\nExit polling in Wisconsin showed voters preferred Obama to Romney, but those same polls also showed a nearly even race between Walker and Barrett rather than Walker's 7-percentage-point margin.\n\n\"Wisconsin is likely dead even,\" GOP pollster Matt Towery said. \"Consider the exit polls that showed the gubernatorial race nearly even, and Obama up by 7 percentage points. But then the actual results put Walker up by seven points, suggesting presidential numbers are likely closer to even.\"\n\nTowery added that the \"most important message from Wisconsin is, if that state is close, then other swing states like Florida and North Carolina are likely leaning more Romney than most polls suggest.\"\n\nWhile Republicans in Wisconsin were urging Romney to spend money in the state this fall, outside analysts were more skeptical.\n\n\"I don't see Wisconsin in play,\" said John Zogby, who conducts polling for The \u2588\u2588\u2588. \"On Tuesday, voters there chose Obama over Romney and they also chose stalemate.\"\n\n\"Neither side won\u2014both parties climbed a mound of cow dung and are trying to plant a flag. It was ugly,\" Mr. Zogby said. \"Best for Romney to run more quietly.\"\n\nWhere Romney, the super PACs supporting him, and the Republican National Committee choose to concentrate their financial firepower this fall seems less important to Democrats than how big that firepower will be.\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel made an emergency plea Wednesday for fellow Democrats to go after big donors the way he said Republicans have with great success.\n\n\"The Wisconsin results should serve as a wake-up call for Democrats: on-the-ground organizing is critically important, but it must be coupled with an aggressive air campaign,\" Mr. Israel said in an email to supporters, referring to the huge amounts it takes to run an effective TV ad campaign in many key media markets across the country.\n\nRepublicans, just a few years ago, were complaining that deep-pocket Democratic donors outnumbered and outgave their Republican counterparts. Now, it's the Democrats who are complaining about the playing field.\n\n\"Democratic groups won't outspend Republican groups, but they can keep us in the fight,\" Mr. Israel said.",
    " Title: Federal Investigation Intensifies as Boston Marathon Bombing Suspect Remains at Large\n\nArticle:\n\nThree days after the Boston Marathon bombing, federal investigators are intensifying their search for the individual behind a suspicious encounter at a department store across from the second explosion site. Video surveillance footage from Lord & Taylor, located directly opposite the blast, shows a man acting suspiciously, according to FBI personnel. The man is seen dropping a bag and swiftly departing the area before the second explosion.\n\nThe individual in question is described as a young white man wearing a black jacket, a gray hooded sweatshirt, and a white or off-white baseball cap turned backwards, according to CBS News. Investigators are currently sifting through cellphone call logs, attempting to identify the person of interest by matching cellphone owner information to the elusive face.\n\nCBS correspondent John Miller, a former FBI assistant director, stated that federal authorities decided to release images from the Lord & Taylor video in an effort to enlist the public's help in identifying the man. However, they have yet to make a final decision on whether to proceed with this tactic, according to Miller.\n\nInvestigators are also reportedly seeking the identification of a second person captured on video who was seen carrying a backpack and behaving suspiciously in the vicinity of the first person of interest. The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal have reported that this second individual may indicate that more than one bomber was responsible for the attacks.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that such leads do not always pan out, as was the case in the 2010 failed bombing attempt in New York's Times Square. In that instance, investigators asked for public help in identifying a man in a red shirt leaving the scene, only to discover that he had no connection to the case.\n\nThe race to identify the person or persons of interest will involve more than just flipping through old mug shots. Modern facial recognition software can help investigators quickly search for matches in FBI databases of arrest photos and criminal suspects. In some instances, surveillance cameras in airports and other public locations can even be programmed to look for people with similar features.\n\nThe nation remains on edge in the wake of the Boston Marathon tragedy. An explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, causing numerous casualties, has added to the sense of American unease. In Washington, the FBI announced the arrest of a Mississippi man, Paul Kevin Curtis, in connection with the mailing of letters laced with the poison ricin to President Obama and at least one US senator.\n\nPresident Obama is set to travel to Boston on Thursday for a memorial event for Boston Marathon bombing victims. Part of the city's Back Bay remains a crime scene, cordoned off by police barricades. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick told the AP that he shares the public's frustration with the fact that no one responsible has yet been caught.\n\n\"It's going to happen by doing the careful work that must be done in a thorough investigation,\" said Governor Patrick. \"That means going through the couple of blocks at the blast scene inch by inch and picking up pieces of evidence and following those trails, and that's going to take some time.\"",
    " Title: White House and Congressional Leaders Advance Competing Coronavirus Relief Proposals Amidst Ongoing Economic Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address the escalating economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, White House officials and congressional lawmakers are reportedly working on separate, large-scale coronavirus relief packages. While the Senate is currently deliberating on a more modest second relief bill, the White House is pushing for an $850 billion stimulus package, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is set to discuss the details of this comprehensive coronavirus proposal with Senate Republicans at their weekly policy lunch on Tuesday. Mnuchin, in a statement to reporters on Monday, declined to comment on the specific numbers but acknowledged the proposal's substantial size, stating, \"I\u2019m not going to comment on the numbers now. But it\u2019s a big number.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Mnuchin's proposal would focus on providing cash to individuals and businesses, with a $500 billion allocation for a payroll tax cut, $250 billion for Small Business Administration loans, and $58 billion for the airline industry, among other measures.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Democrats will hold their weekly lunch via conference call, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expected to discuss a $750 billion proposal aimed at addressing the coronavirus and the economic crisis it has triggered. Schumer's proposal includes expanded unemployment insurance, Medicaid funding, assistance for small businesses, and aid for schools transitioning to remote learning, among other measures.\n\nAs the nation grapples with the economic impact of the pandemic, there is growing concern over the possibility of a recession. In an op-ed for CNN, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for a major fiscal stimulus package to prevent economic disaster. Warren's proposal aligns with the approach taken by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has already announced plans for an additional emergency response package.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much overlap there will be between Mnuchin's proposal and Schumer's ideas, as Mnuchin has been the White House's point person in negotiations with congressional Democrats. In an interview with Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Mnuchin emphasized the need for a \"big stimulus program because we need to help American workers now.\"\n\nMnuchin clarified that the administration is not seeking a bailout, stating that providing liquidity to businesses that need it for 3 to 6 months is not a bailout. \"Whatever we need, we are going to get from Congress,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nOther lawmakers have also put forth ideas to combat the economic impact of the pandemic. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) proposed providing every American with a $1,000 check to cover expenses related to layoffs, forced leave, or other coronavirus-related costs. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) introduced a similar proposal last week, calling for a \"temporary universal basic payment\" of $1,000 per month until the coronavirus threat subsides.\n\nAs the situation continues to evolve, both the White House and Congress are under pressure to act swiftly and decisively to provide relief to American workers and businesses struggling in the face of the ongoing pandemic and economic downturn.",
    " Title: Michael Flynn's Legal Team Halts Communications with Trump's Legal Team in Ongoing Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON/NEW YORK - Lawyers for former national security adviser Michael Flynn have ceased communications with U.S. President Donald Trump's legal team, potentially marking a significant development in the ongoing investigation into contacts between Trump's election campaign and Russia, sources familiar with the investigation revealed on Friday.\n\nAccording to two people familiar with the call, Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, contacted John Dowd, Trump's private lawyer, on Wednesday to state that the matter had reached a point where the two could no longer discuss it. The New York Times first reported the cessation of communications between the two legal teams.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Kelner's decision was due to a plea agreement with Special Counsel Robert Mueller for Flynn to cooperate in the probe, or because Flynn has chosen to engage with Mueller's investigation. Two other sources stated that no definitive conclusion should be drawn about Flynn potentially cooperating against the president.\n\nJay Sekulow, another attorney for Trump, stated on Thursday that \"no one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about General Flynn cooperating against the president.\"\n\nDowd, Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, declined to comment on the matter, as did Kelner and White House officials.\n\nFlynn, a retired Army general and a central figure in the federal investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, could potentially provide valuable insights into three major areas of inquiry, according to two sources familiar with Mueller's investigation. These areas include any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 campaign, money laundering and other possible financial crimes by Trump aides, and whether Trump sought to obstruct justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey in May, as Comey was probing the Trump campaign's dealings with Russia.\n\nRussia has denied interfering in the election, and Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia by his campaign, labeling the inquiry a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nTwo congressional officials involved in separate probes into the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia stated that one key area of investigation is whether Flynn or other advisers to Trump ever suggested U.S. economic sanctions on Russia could be lifted in exchange for favorable business deals.\n\nPossible deals include a proposed commercial nuclear power project involving Russian firms that Flynn, in recent years, worked to promote to potential clients in the Middle East, sources familiar with the project told the media.\n\nTrump fired Flynn on February 13, after disclosures that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with then Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, the month before Trump took office, and later misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.\n\nFlynn has acknowledged contacts with Kislyak dating back to 2013, but beyond stating that they covered a variety of subjects, has said nothing about the content of their conversations during Trump's campaign and after his election.\n\nFlynn has been under scrutiny by the special counsel in a number of areas, sources familiar with the investigation have said. Mueller has been investigating whether Flynn knowingly made false statements to the government about his foreign travels, income, and contacts on his security clearance form.\n\nFlynn also has come under scrutiny for work on behalf of Russian clients, and over whether his work for a businessman with ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was lawful.\n\nMueller has been investigating Flynn's son, Michael Flynn Jr.'s, involvement in some of his father's business dealings in Russia, Turkey, and elsewhere, the sources said, and this could provide a potent additional incentive for Flynn to cooperate.\n\nBarry Coburn, a lawyer for Flynn's son, declined to comment.",
    " Title: Whistleblower's Legal Team Expresses Concern Over Safety Amidst Trump's Remarks\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a letter sent to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire on Saturday, the legal team for the whistleblower at the center of the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump has expressed concern over the safety of their client due to the President's recent statements. The letter, made public on Sunday, highlights President Trump's calls for the whistleblower's identity to be revealed and the $50,000 \"bounty\" offered by two conservative Trump supporters for information about the whistleblower.\n\nThe events of the past week have heightened the lawyers' concerns that the whistleblower's identity will be disclosed publicly, potentially putting the individual in harm's way. In the letter, lawyer Andrew Bakaj writes, \"The events of the past week have heightened our concerns that our client's identity will be disclosed publicly and that, as a result, our client will be put in harm's way.\"\n\nThe letter specifically mentions President Trump's call last week for the whistleblower to be identified, as well as the person who supplied the whistleblower with information about the call. It quotes President Trump as saying, \"I want to know who's the person that gave the whistleblower, who's the person that gave the whistleblower the information, because that's close to a spy.\"\n\nThe letter also references the $50,000 \"bounty\" offered as a \"reward\" for information about the whistleblower. \"Unfortunately, we expect this situation to worsen, and to become even more dangerous for our client and any other whistleblowers, as Congress seeks to investigate this matter,\" Mr. Bakaj's letter adds.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, which was launched on Tuesday, focuses specifically on President Trump's call to the Ukrainian president about the Biden allegations. Democrats accuse President Trump of improperly seeking foreign help in the hope of smearing former Vice President Joe Biden and of using military aid as a bargaining tool. However, Ukrainian ex-prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko has told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens.\n\nLawmakers say in addition to the whistleblower, they also wish to speak with President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who President Trump asked the Ukrainian president to coordinate with on an inquiry into the Bidens. The impeachment inquiry is the first part of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial, with a Senate vote requiring a two-thirds majority to convict. Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted and removed.",
    " Title: Gilead Sciences Announces Cost of Coronavirus Treatment Remdesivir, Sparks Debate Among Medical Experts\n\nIn a move that has sparked debate among medical experts, Gilead Sciences, a leading biopharmaceutical company, has announced the cost of its coronavirus treatment, remdesivir. The price for the treatment will be $2,340 per COVID-19 patient for Medicare and \"governments of developed countries,\" which equates to approximately $390 per vial. However, a U.S. patient with private health insurance will be charged $3,120\u2014an estimated minimum of $520 per vial\u2014or up to $5,720 per patient for a longer duration.\n\nIn an open letter, Gilead Chairman and CEO Daniel O' Day outlined the costs for remdesivir treatments. O' Day insists the prices are below market value in an effort to offer \"broad and equitable access.\"\n\n\"As with many other aspects of this pandemic, we are in uncharted territory in pricing remdesivir,\" O' Day wrote. \"Ultimately, we were guided by the need to do things differently.\"\n\nThe company has also entered into various agreements with drug manufacturers capable of producing generic forms of the drug in developing countries. The company expects to begin charging in July.\n\nHowever, the cost outlined covers only a five-day treatment course, while a medical publication previously noted that remdesivir reduced recovery time by an average of four days based on a 10-day course of remdesivir.\n\nMultiple doctors and medical experts have expressed concern about the cost compared to the benefit, with some arguing that clinical studies have not yet indicated whether or not there is even a mortality benefit that can justify the cost.\n\n\"Gilead Sciences charging $2,340 for a 5-day course of Remdesivir that maybe reduces time to recovery, doesn't improve survival, and is likely inferior to the much cheaper dexamethasone for ventilated patients reveals Big Pharma's greed and opportunism during this pandemic,\" tweeted Dr. Eugene Gu, a medical expert.\n\nGilead's announcement about remdesivir comes amid scrutiny of the drug. Despite mounting concerns about the drug as a coronavirus treatment, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a leading expert on the coronavirus, previously touted the drug as he insisted it shows promise.\n\nThe cost of remdesivir is a significant factor in the ongoing debate about the drug's effectiveness and affordability. As the world grapples with the human, social, and economic impact of the pandemic, the pricing of remdesivir remains a contentious issue.",
    " Title: New Federal Reserve Study Suggests U.S. Manufacturing Sector Suffered Short-Term Employment Losses Due to Tariffs\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by two Federal Reserve economists indicates that the ongoing U.S.-China trade war has resulted in a reduction of U.S. manufacturing employment and increased prices for materials used by American manufacturers. The study, which serves as a natural experiment due to the varying effects of tariffs on different industries, found that the benefits from being protected from foreign competition were offset by the increased costs manufacturers faced due to tariffs on their own inputs and retaliatory tariffs on their exports.\n\nThe study, which breaks down the three main effects of the trade war, presents nine charts estimating the impact on employment, production, and prices. The charts reveal that rising input costs decreased employment and increased producer prices, while foreign retaliation also decreased employment. On the other hand, import protection seemed to increase employment, though the effect is statistically borderline.\n\nComparing industries more exposed to each type of effect with those less exposed, the authors found that industries at the 75th percentile of exposure suffered a 1.4% reduction in employment, with the positive contribution from the import protection effect of tariffs (0.3%) more than offset by the negative effects associated with rising input costs (-1.1%) and retaliatory tariffs (-0.7%). The same comparison for producer prices revealed a 4.1% increase.\n\nThe study's findings are significant as American manufacturing employment was on the rise in 2017 and 2018, but it stalled thereafter when the tariffs were in full effect. A policy meant to promote manufacturing work may have contributed to its stagnation instead.\n\nThe study, however, has some limitations. It analyzes the short-term effects of the trade war on American manufacturing and does not provide insights into future developments or the long-term costs and benefits of the tariffs. Additionally, the study does not explicitly consider the effects of increased uncertainty about future trade policy, which may be one of the ways in which the effects of past policy persist.\n\nIn conclusion, the study suggests that the U.S. manufacturing sector has faced short-term employment losses and increased costs due to the trade war. These findings must be considered in the context of overall trends, and further research is needed to understand the long-term implications of the trade war on the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
    " Title: \"The Potential Invocation of the \"Nuclear Option\" in the Senate: A Step-by-Step Guide to the Proposed Alteration of the Filibuster Rule for Supreme Court Nominees\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could significantly alter the Senate's long-standing rules, at least 41 Democrats, according to The Washington Post and other media outlets, are expected to attempt to block the nomination of Neil Gorsuch on the Senate floor. This could potentially lead to Republicans invoking the so-called \"nuclear option\" and voting to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees.\n\nThe filibuster, a Senate rule that requires a super-majority of 60 votes to end debate and move to a final vote, is a unique element in the U.S. Senate, which is often referred to as \"the world's most deliberative body.\" However, this rule, like all other rules governing the Senate, can be rewritten with a simple majority vote.\n\nIf Democrats cannot secure 60 votes to end debate on Gorsuch's nomination, a filibuster could occur, potentially stalling the Senate until Gorsuch is withdrawn from the confirmation process. Here's a step-by-step guide to the process that could unfold if the Democrats fail to secure the necessary 60 votes:\n\n1. The Senate will vote to invoke \"cloture,\" which ends debate on the issue at hand. Under Rule XXII, the Senate requires 60 votes to approve cloture and end a debate.\n2. If cloture fails, a Republican senator will move to reconsider\u2014aka, revote\u2014on the cloture motion. After it fails a second time, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) will raise a point of order declaring that all Supreme Court nominees can be approved with a simple majority vote.\n3. The Senate President pro tempore gets to rule on whether points of order are approved or overruled, based on Senate rules and precedent. In this case, Senate President Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) would presumably rule that McConnell's point of order is overruled, because Senate rules and precedent say cloture is required for Supreme Court nominees.\n4. McConnell gets overruled, but he's allowed under Senate rules to appeal the ruling of the Senate president. If he wants to invoke the \"nuclear option,\" he will appeal Hatch's decision, which triggers an immediate vote (meaning there can be no debate before the vote) on Hatch's ruling.\n5. The vote on the Senate president's ruling is a simple majority vote. If a majority of the Senate votes \"nay\" on Hatch's interpretation of the Senate rules, a new precedent is set to guide future votes on U.S. Supreme Court nominees\u2014namely, a precedent saying cloture is not required.\n6. Democrats will likely appeal that vote, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) raising a point of order and asking the President pro tempore if cloture is required for U.S. Supreme Court nominees.\n7. Hatch will cite the just-taken vote as a new Senate precedent that the threshold for approving Supreme Court nominees is a simple majority. He will overrule Schumer's point of order.\n8. Schumer can appeal this ruling and call for a vote on the Senate President's ruling. Just like what happened in Step 4, this triggers an immediate vote.\n9. The Republican majority will defeat Schumer's appeal, and Hatch's interpretation of the rules (the new interpretation, which says only a simple majority is needed) will be confirmed.\n10. Finally, after all the parliamentary shenanigans, the Senate will return to the question of Gorsuch's nomination. With the new precedent in place, a simple majority vote will approve Gorsuch's nomination and make him the 113th member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAs Peter Suderman wrote in 2013 when then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) did this, the Senate is \"a very elaborate, expensive version of Calvinball.\" This fictional sport from the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, played and invented by the two title characters, has a slew of complicated rules, most of which are arbitrary and some of which are utterly nutty. However, the most important thing to know about the game is that any of the rules can be changed at any time, usually by any player, except perhaps when there are rules prohibiting some players from making those changes.\n\nA similar move with Gorsuch's nomination would preserve the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, a tool both parties might someday wish they still had at their disposal.",
    " Title: Amazon Rainforest Fires: A Closer Look at the Data and Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent Amazon rainforest fires have been a global concern, with numerous news outlets reporting unprecedented rates of burning due to human-induced climate change. Headlines such as CNN's \"Amazon rainforest burning at record rate\" and the New York Daily News' \"The Amazon rainforest is burning. Be afraid\" have dominated the media landscape. However, a closer examination of the data reveals some discrepancies and contextual nuances that warrant further consideration.\n\nBrazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) has been the primary source of these alarming reports. Yet, it is important to note that the satellite fire data referenced only began in 2013, providing six years of data that may not be sufficient to make definitive statements about \"record-breaking\" rates. Furthermore, the satellite data collected was not intended to be used as a counting tool for the number of fires but rather as a readiness alert system to identify fires before they become uncontrollable.\n\nAccording to NASA's Global Fire Emissions Database, activity is above average in the states of Amazonas and Rondonia, but below average in Mato Grosso and Par\u00e1. The overall numbers are in line with historic data that goes back to 2003, providing a more comprehensive and reliable picture of the fires in the Amazon.\n\nTo put these yearly fires in perspective, it is essential to understand the Amazon's fire season, which begins in late July and peaks in mid-September before ending in November. The majority of the fires are intentionally set, as it is much easier to clear the forest through burning rather than felling the timber. It is estimated that up to 15% of the original forest has been cleared in this manner, with most of the loss occurring in the 1990s and 2000s before conservation efforts slowed the deforestation.\n\nFires are rare during much of the year due to the wet nature of the climate. During the dry season, land that has already been cleared is typically burned periodically to regenerate and maintain farmland or pasture. Much of the fire being reported as the virgin tropical rainforest is existing grassland or farmland being regenerated using fire as a tool.\n\nThe Amazonian rainforest plays a crucial role in the global ecosystem, and conservation efforts have been effective in stemming the worst of deforestation abuses. The promotion of alarmist and potentially false information misdirects the energies of people, including world leaders, and undermines trust in media and public institutions.\n\nGregory Wrightstone, a geologist with over 35 years of experience researching and studying various aspects of the Earth's processes, is the author of the new book \"Inconvenient Facts: The Science That Al Gore Doesn't Want You to Know.\" His work provides a valuable perspective on the complexities and nuances of climate change and the Amazon rainforest fires.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Amazon rainforest fires are a pressing issue, it is essential to approach the data with a critical eye and a nuanced understanding of the context. The promotion of alarmist and potentially false information can lead to misguided efforts and undermine trust in scientific and media institutions. A balanced and informed approach is necessary to address the challenges facing the Amazon and our planet as a whole.",
    " Title: Boy Scouts of America Renames Program, Girl Scouts Responds Amidst Membership Decline\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) announced on Wednesday that it will drop \"Boy\" from its signature program, marking a shift towards inclusivity and a broader scope for its membership. The decision, however, has not been met with universal approval, as the Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) expressed reservations about the lack of new, \"girl-specific\" programming.\n\nSylvia Acevedo, CEO of GSUSA, stated, \"Girl Scouts is the premier leadership development organization for girls. We are, and will remain, the first choice for girls and parents.\"\n\nBoth organizations have been grappling with declining membership numbers, a situation that has been exacerbated by the Boy Scouts' decision to open its doors to girls. The umbrella organization will retain its name, Boy Scouts of America or BSA, while the term Cub Scouts, for children aged 7-10, will remain unchanged. The Boy Scouts, for children aged 10 to 17, will become Scouts BSA in February.\n\nMike Surbaugh, the Chief Scout Executive, unveiled the group's \"Scout Me In\" marketing campaign, emphasizing inclusiveness. \"As we enter a new era for our organization, it is important that all youth can see themselves in Scouting in every way possible,\" Surbaugh said.\n\nThe Boy Scouts' move to include girls follows a series of changes, including the announcement in October that it would provide programs for girls and the acceptance of transgender youths into its organization in earlier months. Cub Scouts will formally accept girls starting this summer, with more than 3,000 girls nationwide already enrolled in the BSA\u2019s Early Adopter Program and participating in Cub Scouts before the full launch.\n\nThe BSA argues that allowing girls into the organization will benefit busy families by consolidating programs for their children. Most of the actual Cub packs and Scout troops, however, will remain single-gender. Both genders can work towards the prestigious title of Eagle Scout.\n\nThe BSA currently claims almost 2.3 million members, down from 2.6 million five years ago. This figure includes Venturing and Sea Scouting programs, the latter allowing membership up to 21 years of age. In its peak years, BSA had over 4 million participants.\n\nAdults play a significant role in the program, with nearly 1 million adult volunteers serving as the backbone of the organization.\n\nThe impact of the BSA's aggressive recruitment strategy on the Girl Scouts remains to be seen. The Girl Scouts, best known for its annual cookie sales, currently claims a membership of about 1.8 million.\n\nIn response to the BSA's move, the Girl Scouts have listed a series of efforts aimed at \"staying ahead of the pack of youth organizations.\" This includes 23 new merit badges focusing on outdoors and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math), and last month, the unveiling of a LinkedIn network aimed at tapping a major resource\u2014the group's 50 million alums.\n\nThe goal of the network is \"to support female advancement in the workforce and help prepare girls for a lifetime of leadership and career success.\"\n\nHowever, the impact of the BSA's effort is already being felt. Fiona Cummings, a regional leader of Girl Scouts of Northern Illinois, told the Associated Press that the BSA's decision to admit girls is among the factors that have led to a decrease of over 500 girls in her council's youth membership this year.\n\nShe also noted that relations with the Boy Scouts in her region, which were once collaborative, are now \"very chilly.\"\n\n\"How do you manage these strategic tensions?\" she asked. \"We both need to increase our membership numbers.\"",
    " Title: Clinton's Ties to For-Profit Laureate Education Raise Ethical Questions Amidst Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has been vocal in her criticism of for-profit universities, accusing them of charging high prices and delivering questionable degrees while offering little support to students. However, her administration's stance on for-profit colleges and loan servicers may be complicated by her family's close connections to Laureate Education, a for-profit university with significant ties to the Clinton family and the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAccording to a Brookings Institution study, Laureate's Walden University in Minnesota holds the second most student loans of any U.S. college, with a staggering $9.8 billion in loans. This figure trails only the University of Phoenix. If Clinton wonders why some voters perceive her as graspy and question her trustworthiness, she need look no further than the tangled, lucrative ties among Laureate, its owners, the Clinton family, and the Clinton Foundation.\n\nFrom 2010 until just two weeks before Clinton launched her presidential campaign last year, Laureate paid Bill Clinton $17.6 million as the honorary chancellor. This role involved offering advice to Laureate executives and speaking to students at some of the school's dozens of campuses worldwide. In addition, since 2007, Laureate and its major investors and financiers\u2014including Goldman Sachs, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., SAC Capital, and CitiGroup Private Equity\u2014have donated millions more to the Clinton Foundation, Clinton's two presidential campaigns, and related organizations, as well as speaking fees to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, including $900,000 from Goldman and KKR for four appearances by Hillary Clinton in 2013 alone.\n\nHaving a former president and spouse of a sitting secretary of State become Laureate's public face burnished its reputation as it went on a debt-fueled global buying spree, acquiring dozens of colleges from Latin America to Asia. The Clinton family's connections also provided Laureate with muscular contacts among the global foreign policy elite, helping it fend off more government regulation in the nearly 30 countries where Baltimore-based Laureate operates.\n\nRobert Zoellick, a former World Bank president and deputy secretary of State, is on Laureate's board, and George W. Bush's secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, is a paid adviser to Laureate who has given speeches on its campuses as far away as China. When Clinton stepped down, Laureate replaced him with a former president of Mexico.\n\nEven as Laureate, which has had net losses totaling $563.4 million in its past three fiscal years and $102.4 million in the first quarter of this year, presents itself as a \"public benefit corporation\"\u2014a hybrid of profit-seeking capitalism and high-minded do-gooderism\u2014some of its business practices dance close to ethical red lines.\n\nOutside the USA, for example, Laureate pays recruiters legal \"commissions\" for getting students to enroll in its schools\u2014a practice Congress banned in the U.S. because it encouraged for-profit schools to enroll students and harvest their loan money with little regard to whether they graduated and were able to pay back their loans.\n\nAt Walden, Laureate's largest American campus, loan default rates are lower than the national average. However, according to the U.S. Department of Education, three years after undergraduates leave Walden, 56% have yet to repay a single dollar on their loans compared with 33% nationwide.\n\nIn any other election, the Clintons' ties to Laureate Education would likely receive more attention. In this contest, however, the Democratic presidential nominee is fortunate that her Republican opponent happens to be the founder of Trump University, an operation that makes Laureate look like Harvard.",
    " Title: Millennial Voters: Engaged Yet Underrepresented in Elections\n\nIn the ongoing series \"New Boom\" focusing on millennials in America, a significant question arises: why do millennials, who are increasingly politically engaged, not vote in higher numbers?\n\nAccording to the Harvard Institute of Politics, only 23% of voters under 30 are expected to vote in the current midterm elections. This is a stark contrast to the 52% turnout among young voters in the peak year of 2008. The Pew Research Center reports a steady decline in the number of young voters who are registered to vote, with only 50% able to confirm their registration in 2012, the lowest number recorded since 1996.\n\nDespite their apparent political awareness, millennials are not showing up at the polls in significant numbers. Jacob Bell, a 20-year-old student at the University of Maryland, explains, \"I can pull up Facebook in front of me and see five different articles about the next Senate race, and that's something that I know my mom's generation never had.\"\n\nAshley Spillane, the president of Rock the Vote, attributes this disengagement to the current state of politics. \"Politics right now is really disheartening,\" she says. \"I think it's why you see in the polls that young people are not affiliating with political parties.\"\n\nHowever, Spillane emphasizes that millennials' lack of party affiliation does not equate to apathy. \"They do care very passionately about issues that matter to them,\" she says. \"They are getting involved at a local level. They are creating startups. They are volunteering with local organizations. They are looking to take problems on in real time and fix them.\"\n\nThe challenge, according to Spillane and others, is reaching a generation that is politically engaged but repelled by the current political climate. Eva Guidarini of the Harvard Institute of Politics expresses concern about a generation of voters turning off from politics as they form their political identities, but remains hopeful. \"If politics starts to change in a direction that I think all of America wants to see it change \u2014 not just young people \u2014 then you'll see young people get back in the game,\" she says.\n\nThe question remains whether politics will improve without a new generation getting more involved and pushing for change. The hashtag #newboom invites social media users to join the conversation on this and other issues affecting millennials in America.",
    " Title: Sanders Suspends Lawsuit Against DNC, Maintains Legal Options Open Amidst Voter Data Dispute\n\nIn a recent development, Senator Bernie Sanders has announced that he will not actively pursue his lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) over access to voter data files, but has chosen to keep the case open as a precautionary measure. The decision comes after DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz suspended Sanders' access to the party's voter files last month, following allegations of his staff's unauthorized access to Hillary Clinton's files on the DNC's system.\n\nSanders, an independent senator from Vermont running for the Democratic presidential nomination, apologized for the actions of his staff and initiated an investigation into the matter. However, he contended that Ms. Wasserman Schultz had no authority to immediately suspend his own access, a necessity for his campaign to strategize for targeting voters in the primaries and caucuses.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by Sanders, claimed a breach of contract for data access by the DNC. Following the lawsuit, Ms. Wasserman Schultz relented. The case had been inactive, with Sanders never serving papers on the DNC, prompting Judge Tanya S. Chutkan to demand clarity on Sanders' intentions.\n\nGarvey Schubert Barer, Sanders' lawyer, stated, \"The parties are engaged in discussions and are continuing in their cooperative efforts to resolve the pending litigation. In light of these efforts, plaintiff does not intend to serve defendant at this time. However, if the parties are unable to resolve this dispute, plaintiff reserves the right to serve defendant before the expiration of the time limit for service.\"\n\nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure grant Sanders up to 90 days to serve notice of his complaint on the DNC. Clinton's campaign has previously stated it was a victim of Sanders' actions, but Sanders has countered by asserting that he had alerted the DNC to problems with its system security earlier last year, and the party had failed to address these concerns.\n\nLiberal activists have criticized Ms. Wasserman Schultz for suspending Sanders' access to the voter files, arguing that it could potentially influence the primary process in favor of Hillary Clinton. The ongoing dispute serves as a reminder of the complexities and tensions that can arise within political parties during the presidential nomination process.",
    " Title: Jeb Bush Calls for Stronger U.S. Response to Russian Aggression in Ukraine, Reiterates Support for Trans-Atlantic Alliance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech delivered in Berlin on Tuesday, former Governor Jeb Bush called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to cease his aggressive actions in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, vowing that if elected president, the United States would take a harder line against Russian aggression.\n\nBush, a Republican candidate for the 2016 presidential election, emphasized the importance of respecting the sovereignty of all nations, particularly in the context of Russia's alleged incursion into Ukraine. He stated, \"Russia must respect the sovereignty of all of its neighbors. Who can doubt that Russia will do what it pleases if its aggression goes unanswered? Our alliance, our solidarity, and our actions are essential if we want to preserve the fundamental principles of our international order... an order that free nations have sacrificed so much to build?\"\n\nThe Russian president has denied sending troops into Ukraine, but satellite images suggest otherwise. Bush accused Putin of supporting separatists in their battle against pro-independence forces and urged him to halt his efforts to reintegrate Ukraine into the Russian sphere of influence.\n\n\"Who will say otherwise, as we watch the fate of Ukraine, slowly unfold in tragedy? Ukraine, a sovereign European nation, must be permitted to choose its own path,\" Bush said.\n\nBush has previously expressed support for economic sanctions on Russia and has advocated for the delivery of some U.S. military equipment to Ukraine. His remarks follow President Obama's statements on Monday during his visit to the G-7 in Kr\u00fcn, Germany, where Obama also expressed support for continuing sanctions and urged Putin to seek compromise.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin has pledged to uphold a Cold War-era nuclear treaty, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia has no intention of breaking the treaty. The U.S. has accused Russia of testing a ground-launched cruise missile in violation of the treaty, a claim Russia denies. Russia, in turn, has alleged that some elements of the U.S. missile defense shield violate the treaty, according to the Associated Press.\n\nDuring his speech, Bush also addressed economic issues, emphasizing the importance of free markets and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). He stated, \"The EU and the United States have a common interest in the steady opening of markets across the world. What keeps that progress steady are standards and rules that are modern, transparent, and fair. And that doesn't happen by itself.\"\n\nBush is scheduled to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday at the conference of the economic council of the Christian Democratic Union, the political party Merkel leads. Both are delivering speeches there. Bush concluded his remarks by stating, \"Seventy years after America and Western Europe began to build the post-war architecture of security, that alliance is as relevant as the day it was founded.\"",
    " Title: Tech Giants Face Intense Scrutiny on Capitol Hill: A Day of Skepticism and Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe tech industry faced a day of intense questioning and allegations on Capitol Hill this Tuesday, with the Big Four - Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. - under the microscope in three separate Congressional hearings. Despite the harsh criticism, the stocks of these tech giants remained largely unchanged, reflecting their continued market dominance and strong financial performance.\n\nFacebook's stock (FB) was flat at $203.84, while Alphabet's GOOGL, GOOG shares saw a slight increase to $1,153.46. Apple's AAPL stock remained flat at $204.50, and Amazon's AMZN stock was down 0.5% to $2,009.90. The combined market valuation of these four companies exceeds $3 trillion.\n\nThe day's proceedings were marked by skepticism, particularly towards Facebook's proposed digital currency, Libra. The Senate Banking Committee raised concerns about regulatory and trust issues, and the House Judiciary Committee later singled out Facebook as an antitrust concern.\n\nSen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) bluntly told David Marcus, who heads Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency project, \"I don't trust you guys.\" This sentiment seemed to encapsulate the day's proceedings.\n\nApple, Amazon, and Google also faced criticism. Apple is embroiled in a class-action lawsuit over its App Store practices, while Google was grilled over its search engine practices. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) led the charge against Google in a hearing titled \"Google and Censorship through Search Engines.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) commented, \"The hourglass has run out on regulation and tech. Big Tech is in a perfect storm.\" Karan Bhatia, Google's vice president of public policy and a former senior official in the George W. Bush administration, was also criticized for the company's business dealings in China.\n\nAmazon was questioned about its growing influence in the retail industry and its impact on smaller merchants.\n\nThe day's hearings marked an unrelenting assault on companies that rarely find themselves in defensive postures. However, they may need to get used to this feeling, as potential antitrust investigations by the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission loom.\n\nStanford law professor Doug Melamed noted, \"Everybody wants to take a swipe at Big Tech these days. But the stock market seems to be ignoring all that is happening out of Washington, except for the Fed.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Reflects on His First Term: Identifying Three Key Challenges\n\n Article:\n\nIn an interview, President Barack Obama has acknowledged that he has not fully achieved the spirit he brought to Washington during his first term, citing three main areas of disappointment: not changing the tone in Washington, not telling enough stories, and not getting comprehensive immigration reform passed.\n\nDuring a series of interviews this year, Obama was asked about his biggest failure during his first term, and he provided three different answers. In a recent conversation with Univision's Jorge Ramos, Obama stated that his most significant failure to date has been the lack of comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nIn a separate interview with CBS News' Charlie Rose, Obama admitted that his mistake during the first couple of years of his presidency was thinking that his job was solely about getting the policy right. He emphasized the importance of policy, but also noted that the nature of the office requires telling a story that gives the American people a sense of unity, purpose, and optimism, especially during challenging times.\n\nIn summary, President Obama's self-proclaimed \"biggest\" failures are not effectively changing the tone in Washington, not telling enough stories, and not getting immigration reform passed (despite having a supermajority of Democrats during his first two years in office). It is noteworthy that Obama did not mention his failure to get people back to work or turn the economy around, as he had promised.\n\nObama's habit of being inconsistent, whether it be giving different answers about his biggest failure, saying he has not raised taxes, or making nearly everything a \"top priority,\" has been a recurring theme in his presidency.",
    " Title: Rising Political Polarization in the United States: A Look at the 2016 Presidential Race and Beyond\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 U.S. presidential race has highlighted an unprecedented level of political polarization in American society, according to a report by the Pew Research Centre. The report states that the overall share of Americans who express consistently conservative or consistently liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades.\n\nThis increasing level of partisanship has become evident in various ways, such as the rise of the Tea Party, a grassroots conservative movement, and the government shutdown of 2013. The campaign platforms and actions of both the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates further illustrate this partisan gap.\n\nRepublican candidate Mike Huckabee, for instance, suggested that he might be willing to use the American military to prevent women from getting abortions. While most Republicans are opposed to abortion, it is generally seen as a controversial issue to focus on in the general election. Huckabee's focus on this issue with such a shocking suggestion is indicative of this political polarization.\n\nOn the left, there is Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist whose campaign is gaining traction. Sanders' socialist ideologies are a stark contrast to the American political landscape, where the term \"socialist\" is often used as a derogatory term. The emergence of a candidate who not only supports more socialist policies but has openly admitted to subscribing to socialist ideologies is a testament to the increasing political polarization.\n\nThe rise of partisan politics can be attributed to the fact that these political divisions are greatest among those who are more politically active. According to the Pew Research Report, the majority of Americans do not have uniformly conservative or liberal views, but the most ideologically oriented and politically rancorous Americans make their voices heard through greater participation in every stage of the political process.\n\nThe 2008 recession and the subsequent changes in the American economic climate have motivated many Americans, especially those who were most affected, to push for political change in all directions. The emergence of increasing partisanship and the vocal minorities behind it could be seen as the resurgence of political experimentation in a time of great uncertainty.\n\nThe unconventional platforms of candidates like Ron Paul, who brought libertarian principles to the Republican Party, and the growing interest in US third parties, such as the Free and Equal Elections Foundation, indicate a widening of the ideological spectrum. The US may be primed for dramatic political change that goes beyond the mere polarization or radicalization of basic party principles. The hope is that these misfit candidates or new political parties will bubble up and possibly fill the gap between the partisan extremes.",
    " Title: Michelle Snyder, Key Figure in Obamacare Rollout, Retires from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement released on Monday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the retirement of Michelle Snyder, the agency's Chief Operating Officer who played a significant role in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nMs. Snyder, who oversaw the development and launch of HealthCare.gov, the federal health insurance marketplace, during a period of significant challenges, will be retiring at the end of 2013. CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner expressed gratitude for Ms. Snyder's service, acknowledging her as a distinguished career public servant and a valued member of the agency's leadership team.\n\nInitially, Ms. Snyder had planned to retire at the end of 2012, but chose to stay on to assist with the challenges facing CMS in 2013. Tim Love, her deputy, will serve as the acting Chief Operating Officer in her absence.\n\nMs. Snyder's departure follows the resignation of the agency's Chief Information Officer, Tony Trenkle, in November, who left for a position in the private sector.\n\nIn November, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius identified Ms. Snyder as a key person responsible for the HealthCare.gov project. The rollout of the health insurance marketplace in October and November was marred by technical glitches.\n\nRepresentative Darrell Issa, California Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, offered a statement in response to Ms. Snyder's retirement. He suggested that Ms. Snyder, in her role, approved the launch of HealthCare.gov despite security concerns raised by CMS's top security expert.\n\n\"Documents and interviews indicate Michelle Snyder's involvement in bypassing the recommendation of CMS's top security expert who recommended delaying the launch of HealthCare.gov after independent testers raised concerns about serious vulnerabilities from a lack of adequate security testing,\" Issa said. \"Americans seeking health insurance are left to shoulder the risk of a website that's still an all-around work in progress because of the cult-like commitment officials had to the arbitrary goal of launching on Oct. 1.\"\n\nWith Ms. Snyder's departure, the CMS will continue to navigate the challenges of implementing the Affordable Care Act.",
    " Title: New Health Law Offers Assistance to Those with Expensive Employer-Provided Insurance\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, often associated with providing health insurance to the uninsured, could also offer relief to families like Rori and Zach Callaway, who have experienced a significant increase in their health insurance premiums through their employer. The Dallas family of three, who have been paying $760 a month for the cheapest plan available, could potentially find help through the new state and federally run health insurance exchanges that launched last week.\n\nThe law offers numerous protections for those with employer-provided health insurance, and it could even aid some individuals with hard-to-afford plans or plans that do not cover enough of their health costs. However, the path to relief for the Callaways, and others in similar situations, is complex.\n\nA glitch in the law's wording makes it difficult but not impossible for employees with expensive family plans to receive assistance. The law refers only to the portion an individual's premium is of the household income, not the family's premium. This language was designed to ensure people do not leave workplace plans for subsidized coverage through the exchanges. However, it has had an unintended consequence, as some families could be left without affordable coverage.\n\nThe individual's premium is not supposed to exceed 9.5% of household income. The Callaways' family premium is now almost double that. Karen Pollitz, senior fellow with the Kaiser Family Foundation, explains that families like the Callaways could still shop on the new exchanges; they just would not be eligible for subsidies or tax credits because subsidies are only available to those who cannot afford coverage. If the plans become unaffordable for the first time outside of a typical fall-to-fall plan year, they may qualify for a special enrollment opportunity.\n\nFor help calculating whether your policy would be considered affordable under the law, consult your state exchange or call one of the navigators for assistance. Get linked to your state's exchange and search for navigators there at the federal government's HealthCare.gov.\n\nIn addition to easier-to-understand language, here are other ways the plans you buy during open enrollment will be different:\n\n1. Essential benefits: Everyone's plan, whether obtained on the exchanges or through an employer, must cover certain things, including maternity care, prescription drugs, in-patient hospital care, and lab services. While these contributions are capped at $6,350 per individual or $12,700 per family per year, they may not be considered affordable by the employee.\n\n2. Preventive health care: Doctor or lab visits for procedures including mammograms, colonoscopies, and blood pressure screening have to be covered in full now. No co-pays and no cost-sharing are allowed.\n\n3. Pre-existing conditions: People with pre-existing conditions trying to buy insurance individually have, until now, sometimes been denied coverage. Those with insurance provided by their employers are sometimes subject to waiting periods that can be as long as 12 months. Employees can no longer be subject to any pre-existing condition waiting period.\n\n4. Out of your pocket: Sometimes premiums go up at open enrollment time, but often it's also your co-payments and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. So even if you did not exactly get good news in your open enrollment package about the money you must spend before insurance kicks in, there's a related perk in the law. Your co-payments now count toward your maximum out-of-pocket expenses, so you'll get there faster in 2014.\n\nRori Callaway, a freelance writer who also makes notebooks and journals she sells online, may look for seasonal retail work this holiday season. The family is also going to start selling some of their household items on Craigslist to make ends meet\u2014and pay up to the $4,800 deductible on their plan.\n\n\"The timing is certainly unfortunate,\" Callaway says of her new plan that took effect a month before the exchanges open. \"Surely there will be better options for our family out there with the new health care exchanges. I'm looking for that silver lining.\"",
    " Title: Cross-Party MPs Introduce Bill to Prevent No-Deal Brexit as EU Leaders Discuss Impact of UK Exit\n\nArticle:\n\nA cross-party group of MPs has put forward a bill aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit in 10 days' time. If passed into law, the bill would require the Prime Minister to ask for an extension of Article 50 - which mandates the UK's exit from the EU - beyond the current 12 April deadline. Labour MP Yvette Cooper presented the bill, which supporters hope they can pass through the Commons in one day.\n\nThe Prime Minister is expected to make a statement shortly. The development comes after the cabinet, which remains split over Brexit, met for eight hours in No 10. The BBC's John Pienaar reported that Theresa May's ministers considered plans to \"ramp up\" no-deal Brexit preparations, and a snap general election was also discussed.\n\nMs Cooper's bill would make it UK law for the Prime Minister to ask for an extension to prevent a no-deal, but it would be up to the EU to grant it - or not. In March, MPs voted against leaving the EU without a deal, but it was not legally binding. Meanwhile, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said a no-deal Brexit is now more likely but can still be avoided.\n\nMr Barnier said a long extension to the UK's 12 April exit date had \"significant risks for the EU,\" and a \"strong justification would be needed.\" France's President Emmanuel Macron and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar are meeting in Paris to discuss the impact of Brexit. President Macron told reporters that the EU \"cannot be hostage to the political crisis in the UK,\" and the government must come forward with \"credible\" reasons for an extension.\n\nHe said these could include an election, second referendum, or alternative proposals for the future relationship, such as a customs union. Mr Varadkar said the UK was \"consumed by Brexit,\" but the EU should not be. He said the EU \"needs to be open\" about any proposals the UK brings, including a longer extension, and they will do what they can to \"assist.\"\n\nHowever, he added: \"We gave the UK some time, some space, and some opportunity to come up with a way forward... [but] as things stand, they will leave on 12 April without a deal.\" Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who supports Ms Cooper's bill, said: \"This is a last-ditch attempt to prevent our country being exposed to the risks inherent in a no-deal exit. 'We realize this is difficult. But it is definitely worth trying.\"\n\nMs Cooper said the UK was \"in a very dangerous situation\" and MPs \"have a responsibility to make sure we do not end up with a catastrophic no-deal.\" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One, she added: \"We have been attempting to squeeze into just a couple of days a process that really should have been happening for the last two years - a process of trying to build a consensus around the best way forward.\"\n\nNormally, the government chooses which bills to present to Parliament in order for them to become law. But - much to the government's disapproval - MPs voted to allow backbenchers to take charge of business in the Commons on Wednesday. This gives backbenchers the opportunity to table their own bills, such as this one from Yvette Cooper. A copy of the bill shows that they want to push it through the commons in one day.\n\nAs the backbenchers will be in charge, they will also be able to vote to set aside more time on another day, if they need to complete the process or hold further indicative votes. However, the bill would also have to be agreed by the House of Lords and receive Royal Assent before it became law - which, if the Commons agrees it on Wednesday, could happen as soon as Thursday.\n\nBrexiteer Tory Sir Bill Cash said trying to go through these stages in one day made it a \"reprehensible procedure.\" But Speaker John Bercow said that, while it was \"an unusual state of affairs,\" it was \"not as unprecedented as he supposes\" - citing recent bills on Northern Ireland that have been passed at the same speed.\n\nIn the latest round of indicative votes on Monday, MPs voted on four alternatives to the PM's withdrawal deal, but none gained a majority. MPs rejected a customs union with the EU by three votes. A motion for another referendum got the most votes in favor, but still lost. The votes were not legally binding, but they had been billed as the moment when Parliament might finally compromise.\n\nThe Independent MP Chris Leslie tweeted that MPs would be seeking more time for indicative votes to take place on Monday. Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb said he is considering resigning the whip after his party refused to back proposals for a customs union and Common Market 2.0 on Monday. He told \u2588\u2588\u2588: \"If you are seen to be unreasonable, not engaging to find solutions, I don't think it is very attractive to the people.\"\n\nEarlier, Mr Barnier said: \"No deal was never our desire or intended scenario, but the EU 27 is now prepared. It becomes day after day more likely.\" Mrs May's plan for the UK's departure has been rejected by MPs three times. Last week, Parliament took control of the process away from the government in order to hold a series of votes designed to find an alternative way forward.\n\nEight options were put to MPs, but none was able to command a majority, and on Monday night, a whittled-down four were rejected too. A five-hour cabinet meeting on Wednesday 3 April: Potentially another round of indicative votes, and Yvette Cooper's bill to be debated. Potentially another round of indicative votes, and Yvette Cooper's bill to be debated on Thursday 4 April: Theresa May could bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament for a fourth vote, while MPs could also vote on Ms Cooper's bill.\n\nTheresa May could bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament for a fourth vote, while MPs could also vote on Ms Cooper's bill on Wednesday 10 April: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension. Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension on Friday 12 April: Brexit day, if UK does not seek / EU does not grant further delay.

    " Title: Rolling Stone's \"A Rape on Campus\" Raises Questions About Journalistic Ethics and Reporting Traumatic Events\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Rolling Stone's high-profile story about a horrifying alleged gang-rape on campus appears to be facing scrutiny in the wake of serious questions raised about the central example used in the story. This story should serve as a reminder of the challenges in accurately reporting on traumatic events and the heightened ethical responsibilities that fall on journalists who do so.\n\n\"A Rape On Campus\" began with a narrative told by a young woman named only as \"Jackie\" about a gang rape that she claimed to have experienced at a fraternity party. Rolling Stone issued an apology for the story today, stating, \"There now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced.\"\n\nThis story should serve as a reminder of the challenges in accurately reporting on traumatic events, and the heightened ethical responsibilities that fall on journalists who do so. The reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, did not fully check the details of Jackie's story before publishing it or contact the alleged perpetrators involved. Today, the Washington Post reported that the fraternity where Jackie said the attack took place did not host a party on the night Jackie said she was raped, and that no member of the house fits Jackie's description of her assailant.\n\nThe problem lies not with Jackie, but with the magazine's failure to report the story in a careful and ethical way. The reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, did not fully check the details of Jackie's story before publishing it or contact the alleged perpetrators involved. Today, the Washington Post reported that the fraternity where Jackie said the attack took place did not host a party on the night Jackie said she was raped, and that no member of the house fits Jackie's description of her assailant.\n\nThe reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, claims that she was trying to protect Jackie, who feared that she might suffer retribution if Rolling Stone contacted her attackers. However, failing to ensure that the story was accurate before exposing it to public scrutiny did not protect Jackie. It left her vulnerable.\n\nIt is important to note that it is incredibly difficult for traumatized people to tell an accurate story, even if they are trying to do so. There are many reasons for this. In severe cases, post-traumatic stress disorder can cause memory loss, or make the true details of stories too painful to recount. One client of mine would shut down physically when asked to recount certain events, falling into a narcoleptic sleep mid-sentence. Another time, a woman I was interviewing about her sexual assault suffered a mental break and regressed to childhood, begging me to bring her to her long-dead mother.\n\nEven in less severe cases, people's stories often contained errors or omissions. Dates would be wrong. Sometimes people would mistakenly name the wrong group as being responsible for persecuting them. Clients would focus on some facts and leave out others. All of that could easily have been reason to doubt the entire story, but when I checked the fundamental facts involved against other evidence - medical records, news stories, sometimes even the accounts of the perpetrators themselves - they would turn out to be true.\n\nThe problem was not that people were making up stories, but that the details that seemed important to me were not what mattered to them. For instance, when I asked one young woman how she could be unsure which armed group was responsible for the attack that had forced her and her family to flee their home, she told me, \"When someone comes to your house to kill you, you do not ask them for their ID card.\" And there are some details that are simply difficult for anyone to notice and remember, such as the names of streets in a town with which a person is unfamiliar, the dates of events far in the past, or the faces of strangers they had never met before the trauma in question.\n\nThat meant that I had a responsibility to protect the people I interviewed by checking the details of their stories before exposing them to the scrutiny of the public or an immigration court. Presenting their stories without first doing that kind of due diligence would not have been a way to protect them from harm. Rather, it would have left them with a record that undermined their credibility, and no means to recover from it.\n\nI have no idea how much, if any, of Jackie's story is true. I did not speak to her. It is of course possible that it is all a lie, or that some parts of it are true but she intentionally changed some details for reasons of her own. If so, then she bears responsibility for that decision. But it also seems like she could be in a similar situation as the people I worked with in the past. According to the Washington Post, she has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which can affect memory and make it more difficult to retell a story accurately. This could explain the apparent errors in the Rolling Stone story: the date of the attack, the name of the fraternity.\n\nBefore I had experience working with trauma victims, I would have scoffed at the idea that anyone could make that kind of mistake. But now I can easily believe it. By failing to check Jackie's story, Rolling Stone and Erdely were not protecting her. They were leaving her vulnerable. That was wrong and irresponsible, not just toward the alleged perpetrators, but toward their readers, and toward Jackie herself.",
    " Title: Avaaz Launches Global Campaign to Mobilize U.S. Voters Abroad Ahead of Election\n\nArticle:\n\nA new campaign, dubbed as the \"October surprise that will end Trump,\" is aiming to mobilize a \"secret swing state\" of more than 8 million mostly unregistered global citizens and progressive Americans living abroad to vote in the U.S. election. The initiative was launched in London, United Kingdom, on Wednesday by Avaaz, a registered U.S. charity and one of the world's largest and most powerful activist groups.\n\nCampaigners, who were seen touring from the University College London down to Parliament, blasted Bruce Springsteen's 'Born in the USA' while chanting \"Don't Vote Trump\" from an open-top bus. While it is illegal for registered U.S. charities to work with or for presidential candidates, a spokeswoman for Avaaz denied any connection to the Hillary campaign when questioned. However, campaigners with Avaaz were recorded shouting, \"Vote for Hillary!\" during the demonstration.\n\nAvaaz points out that 88% of Americans living abroad did not register to vote in the last presidential election, and they argue that this \"massive untapped voting block\" is more likely to be \"progressive\" because \"56% of us [in the UK] have masters degrees\" and overwhelmingly donated to Democratic candidates in the last three presidential primaries.\n\nIn a press release, Avaaz references a new Oxford University study that found \"America's overseas voters\u2026 could decide the US presidency in 2016.\" When combined, the potential 8 million voters around the world would make up the 13th largest state, they say. Just 12% of Americans abroad were registered to vote in 2012, and \"the reason they don't vote is that it's a complicated process for them to register from abroad, and many Americans miss the deadline,\" Meredith Alexander, the Campaigns Director for Avaaz, told Breitbart London.\n\nHer charity, which has also campaigned for \"refugee rights\" and against Brexit, claims to have \"enlisted over 30 million people around the world to share\" a new \"super easy\" tool enabling left-wing American expats to register to vote quickly en masse. Avaaz launched in 2007 to agitate for various left-wing causes including animal rights and mass migration. They organized the biggest climate change march in the UK's history and have been described by the Guardian as \"the globe's largest and most powerful online activist network.\"\n\nThe official campaign makes no mention of other presidential candidates and is framed as simply anti-Trump. Banners on the bus today insisted the campaign is \"not authorized by any candidate or candidate office\" and linked to Avaaz.org/VoteAbroad, an unintentionally close sound to 'Voter Fraud' \u2013 an issue which campaigners will be keen to avoid discussion of.\n\n\"We are a charity in the United States, we are governed by American law, and we are not allowed to coordinate with any candidate,\" Ms. Alexander explained to Breitbart London. \"But, we are absolutely allowed to advocate for our position,\" she added. \"And our position is that Trump is a global threat.\"\n\nHer argument was that Avaaz was not working for Hillary, which would be illegal, but was instead dedicated to issues like climate change and opposing nuclear weapons, and therefore must oppose Mr. Trump and his policies, which implicitly means backing Hillary.\n\nAvaaz's website encourages people to email potential U.S. voters in other countries, giving them a template that reads: \"8 million Americans abroad could defeat Trump\u2026 if they vote! I wanted to make sure you saw this new overseas registration tool that makes voting dead-easy. It literally takes a few minutes : )\"\n\nThe charity's website also states, \"Avaaz is just as strongly in support of trying to stop Brexit as we are of trying to stop Trump.\" Meredith Alexander said, \"Avaaz is just as strongly in support of trying to stop Brexit as we are of trying to stop Trump\" and that it is \"part of the same challenge\" of suppressing populist, anti-globalist movements.\n\nAvaaz co-founder Ricken Patel has worked for \u2013 either directly or as a consultant \u2013 numerous globalist foundations and corporations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Gates Foundation. According to POLITICO, George Soros has committed around $25 million to assisting Hillary Clinton and Democratic Party causes at this election cycle. Avaaz also campaigned against the UK leaving the European Union under the banner: \"Choose Love, Vote Remain.\"",
    " Title: Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro Declared Winner of Presidential Election, Promises Change\n\nArticle:\n\nBrazil's Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced on Sunday that Jair Bolsonaro, a controversial political figure known for his anti-establishment stance and hardline positions, has won the country's presidential election. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, garnered 55.5% of the votes, while his leftist rival Fernando Haddad secured 44.5%.\n\nBolsonaro, who has a 27-year career in Congress, positioned himself as a political outsider despite his long-standing political career. His campaign gained traction with promises to combat violent crime, loosen gun laws, and enact market-friendly reforms. However, his vows to give police a freer hand to use force against suspects have raised concerns about a potential bloody crackdown and erosion of civil rights.\n\nBolsonaro's reputation for offensive statements and extreme views, including insults towards women, black people, and the LGBT community, has been a significant part of his image. Raquel Nunes, a 27-year-old secretary from Sao Paulo and an avid Bolsonaro supporter, expressed her support for the candidate, stating, \"I'm afraid to go out at night when it gets dark, but he's going to solve this, he's going to be firm. Talking didn't get us anywhere, so we need to respond with force.\"\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Jose Dias Toffoli, read out part of the Constitution to reporters after he voted. Toffoli's remarks, which emphasized the need for the future president to respect institutions, democracy, the rule of law, and the judiciary branch, were interpreted by many as a rebuke of Bolsonaro and his more extreme positions.\n\nVoters in Sunday's runoff election appeared to look past warnings about Bolsonaro's potential impact on democracy and embraced a chance for radical change after years of political turmoil. Sandra Coccato, a 68-year-old small business owner, expressed her hope for change after voting for Bolsonaro in Sao Paulo, stating, \"Lots of bad people are leaving, and lots of new, good people are entering. There's a light at the end of the tunnel.\"\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, Bolsonaro's supporters celebrated with fireworks on iconic Copacabana Beach. In Sao Paulo, cars honked their horns, and crowds celebrated as the results came in. In some neighborhoods, crowds gathered with banners and flags, cheering and setting off firecrackers. Riot police separated supporters of Bolsonaro and those of his leftist rival Haddad when they briefly scuffled in Sao Paulo.\n\nBolsonaro went into the election as the clear front-runner after securing 46% of the votes to Haddad's 29% in the first round of the election on October 7. Despite opinion polls showing Bolsonaro leading by as much as 18 percentage points, the race tightened in the final days, but Haddad was unable to make up the difference.\n\nRafaela Rosa, a 32-year-old teacher, expressed her vote for Bolsonaro as a means to keep the Workers' Party out of office. \"We have had enough corruption, and now we need to clean up,\" she said after voting in Sao Paulo.\n\nAs the new president, Bolsonaro has promised to change Brazil's destiny and make the country a great nation. \"We have everything we need to become a great nation,\" Bolsonaro said in a video broadcast on his Facebook account shortly after his win. \"Together we will change the destiny of Brazil.\"",
    " Title: Akin Huddles with Conservative Leaders in Tampa as He Weighs Senate Bid Amidst Pressure\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of mounting pressure from Republican heavyweights in Washington to abandon his Senate bid, Representative Todd Akin has been holding private meetings with top conservative activists in Tampa, Florida, to evaluate his future in the Missouri race.\n\nAkin spent Wednesday night and Thursday at the Council For National Policy (CNP), a secretive gathering of conservative leaders, discussing his political future before next week's Republican National Convention in Tampa. The congressman was initially scheduled to attend the conference unrelated to the controversy surrounding his \"legitimate rape\" comments, which have caused a stir within the Republican Party and shifted the focus of the presidential race towards the contentious social issue of abortion.\n\nMultiple sources at the CNP conference told CNN that Akin is being encouraged by leading figures in the conservative movement to continue his Senate campaign despite the pressure from the Republican establishment. However, several activists and conservative thought leaders acknowledged the long odds Akin faces, with one person attending the summit stating that many were \"spooked\" by a poll showing Akin trailing Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill by 10 points.\n\nA source close to Akin told CNN that the congressman is \"keeping an open ear to those people who are pushing him or questioning him on viability.\" Yet, the source emphasized that Akin is receiving \"a ton of support\" from conservatives at the conference.\n\nSeveral conservatives attending the conference, most of whom refused to speak on the record due to the secretive nature of the CNP, expressed resentment at the aggressive and heavy-handed treatment of Akin by Republican leaders in Washington who have pressured him to quit the Missouri race. At least two people at the conference named Karl Rove, a co-founder of the powerful 527 group American Crossroads, as a specific source of frustration.\n\nParticipants in Thursday's meetings said support for Akin was not universal among conservatives. Richard Land, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission at the Southern Baptist Convention, stated that while Akin misspoke and has been treated \"unfairly,\" he should still drop out.\n\nAkin addressed a small dinner on Wednesday night but made no direct mention of the scandal engulfing his campaign, two sources present for that session told CNN. The congressman, who has deep ties to the Christian right, is also hosting an invitation-only reception on Thursday evening.\n\nRalph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, was among those who spoke privately with Akin on Thursday. Reed declined to reveal details of their conversation but made plain his sympathy for Akin: \"As a general rule, I have devoted my career to encouraging men and women of faith to run for office. I don't encourage men and women of faith not to run.\"\n\nAlong with Land and Reed, the conference was attended by Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly, direct mail specialist Richard Viguerie, National Rifle Association Chairman David Keene, former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, pollster Kellyanne Conway, Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, Americans United For Life founder Charmaine Yoest, former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, and many others.\n\nAlso present were a fleet of talk radio hosts, communications consultants, school reform activists, and several Republican political operatives. Little is known about the CNP, aside from a website which describes its members as \"the country's most influential conservative leaders in business, government, politics, and religion.\" New members must be vouched for and invited by current ones. CNP meetings are described as \"media-free zones\" where conservatives can network and strategize freely.\n\nEven members of the group who spoke to CNN anonymously were hesitant to discuss the group or anything related to the Akin controversy. \"I can't talk about what they talk about here, it's all confidential,\" said one CNP participant. \"Sorry.\"\n\nWhen Akin was approached by a CNN camera while sitting on a veranda Thursday outside the hotel, an aide quickly moved to block the photographer's shot. Politico first reported Akin's trip to Tampa on Wednesday to attend the conference, but the details of Akin's whereabouts and the details of his meetings were not known until Thursday.",
    " Title: A Look Back at 2016: A Year of Progress and Milestones\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the year 2016 draws to a close, it is a fitting time to reflect on the significant events and achievements that marked the past 12 months. Despite the challenges and controversies that dominated the headlines, there were numerous instances of progress, resilience, and triumph. Here are a dozen notable milestones from 2016:\n\n\u2022 Minimum wage increases in 20 states and the District of Columbia: With a phased-in raise to $15 by 2019 in New York City, and the rest of the state on a path to that level in the future, 4.4 million minimum wage-earning Americans are now making more money. Washington state raised its minimum wage as of January 1 by $1.53 to $11 an hour, while Arizona increased its minimum wage by $1.95 to $10 an hour. California is raising its minimum wage by 50 cents in 2017 and again in 2018, and then a dollar a year through 2022 to reach $15 an hour.\n\n\u2022 Reproductive rights victory: In a 5-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of reproductive rights in the case of Whole Women\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. The Court majority, led by Justice Stephen Breyer, struck down a Texas law that required doctors at clinics providing abortions to have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles and that the clinics have facilities equal to a mini-hospital.\n\n\u2022 Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill: Thanks to activist efforts, the Treasury will be replacing Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.\n\n\u2022 Increase in wild tiger population: For the first time in a century, the number of tigers in the wild increased. The count is now 3,820 compared with 3,200 in 2010.\n\n\u2022 Malaria-free Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka\u2019s bold 2009 plan to wipe out malaria worked. The country is now malaria-free.\n\n\u2022 Unemployment rate drop: U.S unemployment fell to 4.6 percent, the lowest level in nine years.\n\n\u2022 Colombia peace agreement: After 50 years of civil war, the Colombian government and FARC guerrillas signed a peace agreement.\n\n\u2022 Paris climate agreement: The Paris climate agreement came into force. It took 25 years to get a solid agreement, but in October, 55 countries representing 58.85 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions ratified the Paris pact with the goal of cutting those emissions quick enough and deep enough to keep the world\u2019s average temperature from rising more than 3.6\u00b0 Fahrenheit by the turn of the century.\n\n\u2022 Ebola vaccine: Researchers developed a vaccine against ebola that is 100 percent effective.\n\n\u2022 Ending female genital mutilation: 300 West African communities pledged to end female genital mutilation.\n\n\u2022 Olympic gold rush: U.S. gymnasts Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, Laurie Hernandez, and Madison Kocian won a record nine Olympic medals among them.\n\nWhile the year 2016 may be remembered for its political upheavals and divisive rhetoric, it is important to acknowledge the positive strides made in various areas, from social justice to scientific advancements, and from economic progress to international cooperation. As we move forward into 2017, let us continue to celebrate and build upon these achievements, and work together to create a brighter future for all.",
    " Title: Tennessee School District Faces Allegations of Unconstitutional Mentoring Program Partnership with Local Church\n\nArticle:\n\nOfficials from the Kingsport, Tennessee City Schools are currently reviewing a complaint by the Wisconsin-based Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) that their mentoring program in partnership with Christ Fellowship Church is \"unconstitutional.\" The FFRF, a group that identifies its members as \"free-thinkers\" (atheists and agnostics), alleges in a letter to the school district that the mentoring program with Christ Fellowship Church \"impermissibly advances religion\" and that the district \"cannot allow its schools to be used as recruiting grounds for churches.\"\n\nThe FFRF cites the church's Facebook page as evidence, where it recruits volunteers for the mentoring program and where current mentors describe their work as a type of \"missionary work\" and \"an opportunity to share Jesus's love.\" However, Assistant Superintendent for Administration Andy True stated, \"They're saying this is a proselytizing situation. This is not. It's not anything where religion is being brought into the school.\"\n\nThe FFRF does not cite a specific incident in the warning letter where a mentor has tried to proselytize a student. Instead, it complains that the program uses church personnel at all, stating that it \"allows church personnel to come into the school during the school day to interact with students.\"\n\nJoe Gervais, a mentor from Christ Fellowship Church at Kingsport's John Adams Elementary School, told a School Board meeting that mentors spend 45 minutes to an hour each week with assigned students, often eating breakfast or lunch with them, as well as playing games or reading to them. Gervais said he asks his student, whom he says does not have a father at home and who reminds him of his grandson, about his day and week, about problems he might be having, about life in general, and about what's going on at home.\n\nSchool superintendent Jeff Moorhouse described the mentoring program as \"just having more hands grabbing an oar\" to help students in school and in life. According to Adams Elementary school counselor Ashley Marlowe, fifteen students were mentored under the program at Adams last year, and just eight this year due to a shortage of volunteers.\n\nThis is not the first time the Freedom From Religion Foundation has taken issue with some of the practices and traditions of communities, particularly in the Bible Belt, far from their Wisconsin base. Recently, the group complained that the governor of Oklahoma was mingling religion and state because of a speaking engagement he had at his own church. It also objected on so-called constitutional grounds to prayer before various football games and to the baptizing of football players in a tub on the school playing field after hours, to name just a few.\n\nHowever, the FFRF's stance is not surprising, given the group's stated disdain for religious belief on its website, claiming that \"most social and moral progress has been brought about by persons free from religion.\" The argument raises a defining question: if FFRF's version of history and the Constitution is accurate, can Christians, acting from faith, ever be allowed to help with \"social and moral progress\" in their communities without leaving their religiously-motivated conviction to \"love their neighbors\" outside the door? More narrowly, can a public school mentoring program continue even though it's staffed by Christian volunteers? The school district is currently reviewing the complaint and has not yet made a decision on the matter.",
    " Title: Rush Limbaugh: GOP's Failure to Embrace Tea Party in 2010 Cost Them in 2012, Predicts Strong Tea Party Presence in 2014 Midterms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent broadcast, conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh criticized the Republican Party for not embracing the Tea Party movement in 2010, a decision he believes cost them in the 2012 elections. However, Limbaugh anticipates a significant Tea Party turnout in the 2014 midterm elections due to the absence of a single national candidate on the ballot and the escalation of issues that sparked the Tea Party's initial rise.\n\nLimbaugh argued that the Republican Party had potential allies in the Tea Party movement, but chose to distance themselves. He suggested that the party could have welcomed the Tea Party into their ranks and built a movement around them. However, the Tea Party activists who attended rallies and town hall meetings in 2010 were often vilified by the media and Democrats, causing Republican leadership to distance themselves, according to Limbaugh.\n\nOver time, Limbaugh explained, Tea Party members have come to understand that the Republican establishment views them as \"unsophisticated types who do not understand how politics works, [who are] emotional and a little out of control.\" He suggested that the GOP leadership saw the Tea Party as a group that needed to be contained rather than embraced.\n\nLimbaugh emphasized that the Tea Party is a motivated, energized, activist group willing to donate, and could have been a valuable asset to the Republican Party. He lamented the party's rejection of millions of people who wanted to support it.\n\nIn 2012, Limbaugh expected a strong Tea Party presence in the presidential election, but was disappointed. He attributed this to the Tea Party's perceived rejection by the Republican Party. \"The (Republican) party had in any number of ways let them know they were not interested,\" he said.\n\nLooking ahead to the 2014 midterm elections, Limbaugh expects the Tea Party to make a significant showing due to the absence of a presidential candidate on the ticket, which he believes will free Tea Party members to vote more freely. Additionally, he believes the Tea Party will be motivated to turn out to prevent President Obama from gaining control over all branches of government.",
    " Title: Senate's Balanced Budget Proposal Fails to Advance in Republican-Controlled Senate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant setback for fiscal conservatism, Sen. Rand Paul's (R-Ky.) balanced budget proposal, known as the \"Pennies Plan,\" failed to advance in the Republican-controlled Senate on Monday. The bill fell short in a procedural vote, with only 22 senators voting in favor of a cloture motion that would have brought the bill to a final vote.\n\nThe failure of the bill marks another sign of the waning commitment to fiscal responsibility in Congress, as the national debt continues to climb towards record highs, with the budget deficit approaching $1 trillion this year.\n\n\"We teach our children that money doesn't grow on trees, and then they grow up watching politicians pretend otherwise,\" Paul said before the vote. \"Meanwhile, our debt soars past $22 trillion, endangers our country, and artificially limits what our nation can achieve.\"\n\nPaul's proposal called for a 2 percent reduction in federal spending for each of the next five years, aiming to reduce federal spending by about $11 trillion over the next decade. The plan is an adaptation of the \"Penny Plan\" that Paul has been advocating for several years, though he now argues for an additional penny in cuts for every federal dollar spent to achieve a balanced budget.\n\nThe growing gap between federal spending and revenue is a pressing issue. During the first seven months of the current fiscal year, which began in October 2018, the federal government ran a $531 billion deficit, a 38 percent increase over the same period last year.\n\nAccording to an analysis from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, about 60 percent of this year's expected deficit is the result of policies\u2014mostly last year's significant increase in spending that surpassed Obama-era budget caps\u2014put in place by current legislators and signed by the current president.\n\nThe share of debt held by the public currently stands at about 78 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), a shorthand measure of a country's economic output in a single year. The numbers are actually worse, as \"debt held by the public\" accounts for only $15.8 trillion of the $21 trillion national debt. The remaining debt is held by parts of the federal government, such as the Social Security trust fund.\n\nAlarm bells are starting to sound. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) warned in April that America's current fiscal situation is \"unsustainable.\" The GAO estimates that the amount of debt held by the public is on track to surpass the all-time high of 106 percent of GDP within the next 13 to 20 years.\n\nCongress appears to be as apathetic as ever about the growing pile of federal debt. Most Republicans, according to Paul, go back to their districts and claim to support balanced budgets, but \"they're not really for balanced budgets if they vote for budgets that don't balance.\"\n\nPaul also criticized Democrats, who he accused of pushing for costly spending plans that promise free college tuition, increased government spending on healthcare, and retirement entitlements. These proposals, Paul argued, would add trillions of dollars to the national debt or require massive tax hikes.\n\n\"These proposals are ludicrous,\" said Paul. \"We have so much debt from what we are already trying to give you, and these people want to double, triple, and quadruple that. It's a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nLast year, Paul was able to get the balanced budget proposal to the Senate floor after striking a deal with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) during an earlier budget impasse to get the bill on the floor. Paul called that vote a \"litmus test for conservatives,\" and most of them failed it as the measure went down in flames, 76 to 21.",
    " Title: U.S. Imposes New Tariffs on Chinese Imports, Threatens Long-term Economic Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has announced its intention to impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, escalating the ongoing trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. The new tariffs, which will take effect on Monday, will see a 10 percent duty applied to these goods, with the potential to rise to 25 percent next year.\n\nThe move comes after the U.S. imposed a 25 percent tariff on about $50 billion in Chinese goods earlier this year, prompting counter-tariffs from Beijing. China has announced plans to retaliate on the U.S.'s $200 billion tariff round by imposing levies on $60 billion of American goods.\n\nThe latest round of tariffs will primarily affect consumer-oriented goods, potentially causing a decrease in consumer spending and harming the retail sector in 2019, according to analysts Seema Shah and Danielle McIntee of Bloomberg Intelligence. Lower-income families, who are already feeling the pinch, are most at risk due to the likelihood of price increases on everyday items.\n\nThe U.S. is monitoring China's response to the $200 billion round of tariffs, but has not yet announced any plans for a further round of duties. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has stated that the tariffs are spread over a wide range of goods, and Americans should not notice significant price increases.\n\nThe U.S. remains open to trade negotiations with China, but there are currently no scheduled meetings. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has extended an invitation to resume trade talks with Chinese counterparts, but China had previously stated they would refuse to negotiate if the Trump administration followed through with the $200 billion tariff round.\n\nThe administration argues that inaction would leave the American economy and consumers worse off in the long run, and that the tariffs are necessary to defend U.S. interests. However, U.S. industry and numerous companies have pushed back against the use of tariffs to force changes to China's economy, with companies such as Gap Inc. and Samsonite International SA stating they are prepared to raise prices if the new tariffs impact their business.",
    " Title: White House Foreign Policy Discord: Nikki Haley and the Russian Sanctions Saga\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent back-and-forth regarding Russian sanctions and the role of Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, has sparked discussions about the Trump administration's foreign policy and the individuals who represent the president. The White House's ability to execute bold diplomatic moves, such as the secret meetings between Mike Pompeo, the CIA director and likely secretary of state, and Kim Jong-Un, has been highlighted, yet the lack of consultation with previous secretaries of state, like Rex Tillerson, has also been a point of contention.\n\nThe controversy began when Haley, during an appearance on \"Face the Nation,\" announced that the administration was preparing to impose sanctions on Russian companies dealing with equipment related to Syrian President Bashar Assad and chemical weapons. However, these sanctions were not announced as expected, leading to speculation and subsequent reports of discord within the White House.\n\nIn response to the miscommunication, Haley issued a statement to Fox News, asserting, \"With all due respect, I do not get confused.\" The Washington Post described this as an \"extraordinary rebuke of the White House.\"\n\nLarry Kudlow, the new economic adviser, initially attributed Haley's statement to a momentary confusion, later admitting that he was \"totally wrong\" and that the policy had been changed without her knowledge. Kudlow subsequently apologized to Haley.\n\nThe incident, according to Politico, marks another instance of discord within Trump's team regarding foreign affairs. Questions have been raised about the relationship between Trump and Haley, given her hawkish stance on Russia and Trump's efforts to cultivate good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, the extent of any deeper strain between the two remains unclear.\n\nAxios summarized the situation by stating, \"These conflicts with top aides\u2014one of them unfolding in the open\u2014show that, in the end, the president will govern how he wants.\" The White House's foreign policy and the roles of its key players continue to be a subject of ongoing scrutiny and debate.",
    " Title: Gallup Poll Reveals Record Low Trust in U.S. Media Among Americans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a new Gallup poll has reported a historic low in the trust and confidence Americans have in the media. The poll, which first began asking the nation about their trust in the press in 1972, shows that only 32% of Americans have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media, marking an eight-percentage point drop from last year.\n\nAccording to Gallup analyst Art Swift, the trust and confidence in the media reached its highest point in 1976, at 72%, following widely acclaimed investigative journalism on the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal. However, the sentiment has been on a steady decline since then, and has not surpassed a majority level since 2007.\n\nThe poll indicates a significant drop in trust among Republicans, with only 14% expressing trust, down from 32% a year ago. This is the lowest confidence among Republicans in the past 20 years, as per the analyst. On the other hand, among Democrats, the trust level stands at 51%, while independents report a trust level of 30%.\n\nMr. Swift suggests that the election campaign could be the primary reason for the sharp drop in trust this year. He notes that with many Republican leaders and conservative pundits claiming that Hillary Clinton has received overly positive media attention, while Donald Trump has faced unfair or negative attention, this could be the primary reason for the erosion of trust among Republicans. It is also possible that the lower trust in the media among Republicans is a result of Trump's harsh criticisms of the press.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed 1,020 U.S. adults from September 7-11, underscores the ongoing challenge faced by the media in maintaining public trust and confidence in their reporting.",
    " Title: Democratic Senators Urge DOJ to Continue Investigation into Fossil Fuel Industry's Climate Denial Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, four Democratic senators, including Bernie Sanders, have urged the Department of Justice (DOJ) to continue its inquiry into the fossil fuel industry's climate denial operation. The call comes a day after Senate Republicans requested the DOJ to cease any such probe.\n\nThe letter, signed by Sanders, Sheldon Whitehouse, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkley, urges the DOJ to view the Republican Senators' May 25 letter as evidence of the need for further investigation into potential fraud within the fossil fuel industry's climate denial operation.\n\nThe senators compared the alleged actions of the fossil fuel industry to the tobacco industry, citing the DOJ's 2006 civil lawsuit victory against the tobacco industry using the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). They argue that fraud is not protected by the First Amendment, and that corporations engaging in fraud should not be able to hide behind the First Amendment to avoid investigation.\n\nIn March, Lynch had referred information on what Whitehouse described as \"the climate denial scheme\" to the FBI. Senate Republicans have criticized this move, labeling it as an attack on free speech and scientific inquiry.\n\nThe Justice Department spokesman, Wyn Hornbuckle, declined to comment on the status of the inquiry when contacted on Friday.\n\nIn a separate letter, five Republican senators, including Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, Jeff Sessions, David Perdue, and David Vitter, argued that efforts to prosecute climate-change skeptics constitute a \"blatant violation of the First Amendment and an abuse of power that rises to the level of prosecutorial misconduct.\"\n\nLast week, 13 House Republicans sent letters seeking information from a coalition of state attorneys general, known as AGs United for Clean Power, on their efforts to pursue climate-change skeptics. Two of those attorneys general, New York's Eric Schneiderman and the Virgin Islands' Claude E. Walker, have since issued subpoenas to ExxonMobil. Walker withdrew last week a subpoena issued to the free-market Competitive Enterprise Institute.",
    " Title: Corey Lewandowski Testifies in First Public Impeachment Hearing, Clashes with Committee Chairman\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated and contentious hearing on Tuesday, former Trump campaign aide Corey Lewandowski testified before the House Judiciary Committee, marking the first public impeachment hearing for President Donald Trump. The hearing, which quickly descended into chaos, saw Lewandowski clashing with Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) over the president's alleged obstruction of justice and efforts to block the Mueller probe.\n\nLewandowski, who is close to the White House and has never worked in the Trump administration, took aim at Democrats and former special counsel Robert Mueller in his opening statement. He described the investigations into the president as \"harassment\" and alleged that some critics sought to bring down the president.\n\n\"Sadly, the country spent over three years and 40 million taxpayer dollars on these investigations. It is now clear the investigation was populated by many Trump haters who had their own agenda \u2014 to try and take down a duly elected president of the United States,\" Lewandowski said in his opening statement.\n\nHe continued, \"As for actual 'collusion,' or 'conspiracy,' there was none. What there has been, however, is harassment of the president from the day he won the election.\"\n\nThe hearing saw Chairman Nadler seeking to question Lewandowski about the 2017 Oval Office meeting in which Trump asked Lewandowski to persuade then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his recusal and set new limits on the Mueller probe. Lewandowski, however, insisted that Nadler provide a copy of the Mueller report so that he could follow along with the passages as Democrats read them.\n\nLewandowski also claimed he does not remember the Oval Office meeting in question. After pausing in answering Nadler's questions, Republicans and Democrats battled over whether the clock should be suspended on the chairman's five minutes of questioning.\n\nThings quickly went downhill from there as GOP members pushed for an adjournment of the panel. The White House sought to place limitations on Lewandowski's testimony, claiming that his discussions with Trump fall under executive branch confidentiality interests.\n\nDemocrats, however, have made it clear they will not accept these limitations for Lewandowski, who they say is the committee's first fact witness and who they believe was part of the president's efforts to block Mueller's probe into possible obstruction. They blasted the White House's efforts to block his testimony that extends beyond the Mueller report. The hearing is set to continue on Wednesday.",
    " Title: Assessing the Evolution of U.S.-China Trade Relations: A Look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Beyond\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of international trade, the relationship between the United States and China has been a subject of intense debate and scrutiny. President Trump's criticism of China's trade practices, often citing the country's economic growth and its challenge to America's global dominance, sheds light on the complexities of this relationship.\n\nThe U.S. and other Western nations played a significant role in China's rapid economic growth over the past four decades, opening up trade and helping transform China from a poor, developing country into an economic powerhouse. However, the challenge lies in getting this fundamentally different economic system to adhere to free market rules.\n\nA pivotal moment came in 2001 when China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), a move that set the rules for free and fair trade between member countries. The U.S. and other nations demanded significant changes from China, including lower tariffs and a reduced role for the government in business operations. However, China argued, as it still does now, that it should be held to less stringent free trade standards due to its status as a developing country.\n\nThe hope was that these initial steps would lead to more sweeping changes, but China's commitment to free market principles has been uneven. China continues to operate as a centrally planned economy, with the government owning, influencing, or subsidizing major industries, giving them an artificial competitive edge. There are also heavy restrictions on foreign investment, and foreign companies are pressured to share their technologies.\n\nIn response to China's perceived non-compliance with free trade norms, the U.S. and other countries complained about insufficient market opening and artificially low currency values. China has been accused of using trade practices that are not acceptable under the global trade system.\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), initiated by Bush and signed by Obama, was an attempt to counterbalance China's growing economic power. The TPP was intended to boost trade, support jobs, and establish stronger rules for trade across the Asia-Pacific region. However, President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the TPP on his third day in office, citing eroding popular and congressional support for trade.\n\nThe TPP's withdrawal marked a significant shift in U.S. trade policy towards China. Trump's administration argues that past approaches to dealing with China have not been effective, and a more aggressive stance is necessary. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and China, with its strengthened economy, appears to be able to withstand these measures.\n\nThe evolving U.S.-China trade relationship is a complex issue with far-reaching implications. As the world's two largest economies, their trade relationship will continue to shape global economic dynamics. The future of this relationship remains uncertain, with the U.S. and China seemingly on a collision course, each pursuing policies that may not align with the other's interests.",
    " Title: Marco Rubio's Presidential Campaign Faces Fundraising and Organizational Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nThe momentum surrounding Marco Rubio's presidential campaign has run into the harsh reality of campaign finance and organization. The Florida senator's team initially claimed to have more campaign funds than fellow Floridian Jeb Bush, but it was found to be inaccurate. The campaign also reported raising $6 million in the last fundraising quarter, a figure that was later revealed to be an overestimation of the actual amount, which was $5.7 million.\n\nHowever, these discrepancies are not the most significant issues plaguing Rubio's campaign, as revealed in his third-quarter filing. The senator is rising in the polls, but the report shows a campaign that is outstaffed by many of its rivals in early-voting states. Rubio's staff is primarily based in Washington, with a small team of early-state operatives. This puts him at a disadvantage, as he has not invested the time in early-state visits that some of his opponents have.\n\nDespite the recent buzz surrounding his candidacy, fueled by strong debate performances, Rubio is not raising enough money to keep pace with his top-tier rivals, and he is running out of time to assemble a robust field organization. Chip Felkel, a South Carolina Republican strategist, stated, \"If Trump-mania subsides, you\u2019ve got to have a mechanism and a structure. I think you\u2019re being risky if you don\u2019t put a structure in place.\"\n\nOperatives in early-voting primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire have expressed concerns. Rubio has spent a combined three weeks in Iowa and New Hampshire this year, while New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who trails Rubio in the polls, has spent six weeks in New Hampshire alone. A longtime New Hampshire operative noted that Rubio has \"missed a lot of opportunities over the year where he could\u2019ve been here more regularly.\"\n\nThe quarterly report released on Thursday shows Rubio with $9.7 million cash-on-hand for the primary season, trailing Ben Carson, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Bush in cash heading into the last three months of 2015. Donald Trump, the frontrunner, has pledged to primarily self-finance his campaign. Rubio is also facing competition from Jeb Bush, who released a bundler list on Thursday that includes many Florida heavyweights, potentially hampering Rubio's hunt for home state dollars.\n\nWith primary elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada in February, followed by a burst of Southern primaries on March 1 and the do-or-die Florida primary on March 15, Rubio's campaign will require a more vigorous fundraising operation than it has shown so far.\n\nRubio's allies argue that his ambitious fundraising goal is achievable. They point to his success in winning over supporters of former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and his aggressive courting of megadonors. Reports suggest that billionaire Sheldon Adelson is leaning increasingly toward supporting the Florida senator.\n\nBackers emphasize that there is still time to build out a field organization in key states, and that large campaign operations are not always winning operations. Rubio's campaign prides itself on its small staff footprint, relying heavily on volunteer support whenever possible. Jeff Sadosky, spokesman for a super PAC backing Rubio, Conservative Solutions, states, \"The right message coming from the party\u2019s best messenger is as effective a turnout machine as anything you can put together.\"\n\nIn South Carolina, an early state where Rubio has shown signs of strength, his allies remain confident about his prospects. Mikee Johnson, a Rubio fundraiser and chairman of the state's Chamber of Commerce, states, \"I would suggest the senator has the most robust operation in South Carolina already. His supporters are... ardent to the point of volunteerism for his effort and for our country. I know this sounds idealistic, but I have seen it first-hand.\"",
    " Title: Senate Confirms Neil Gorsuch as Supreme Court Justice, Marking a Milestone in U.S. Politics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States Senate has confirmed President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, following a contentious 14-month battle for control of the highest court in the nation. The chamber voted 54-45 on Friday to secure the confirmation of Denver appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch.\n\nRepublicans took the unprecedented step this week of changing the Senate's rules to expedite the confirmation process. The confirmation comes within 65 days of Gorsuch's nomination, marking the shortest timeframe for a Supreme Court nominee in recent history.\n\nThe vacancy on the nine-judge bench, caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, left the justices to pass over many controversial issues, potentially to avoid a 4-4 stalemate. The seat remained unfilled for the longest period since during the American Civil War in 1862.\n\nThough Gorsuch was evasive when questioned on legal matters during his confirmation hearings, he has a conservative pedigree and is expected to rule accordingly. Republicans hope Gorsuch will tip the bench's conservative bloc to a 5-4 majority.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell praised Gorsuch, stating, \"He's going to make an incredible addition to the court.\" However, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who led the anti-Gorsuch opposition, expressed concern that the court is \"increasingly drifting towards becoming a more pro-corporate court that favors employers, corporations, and special interests over working America.\"\n\nOn Thursday, McConnell invoked a legislative maneuver known as the \"nuclear option\" when Republicans lacked the 60 votes required to end debate on Gorsuch. The chamber's majority leader effectively dismantled the filibuster rule after Democrats mounted the first filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in half a century.\n\nThe confirmation is a significant victory for Donald Trump's young presidency. For many of those who voted for him, securing a conservative judge on America's highest court was a top priority. \"Congratulations to an exceptionally qualified and respected judge,\" the president tweeted.\n\nGorsuch may be sworn in as early as Friday, allowing him to prepare for the court's next session of oral arguments this month. The Democrats were left frustrated last year when Republicans refused to consider former President Barack Obama's nominee to the court. The Democrats used the \"nuclear option\" in 2013 to overturn Republican filibusters against executive branch and judicial nominees for lower courts. However, they left the filibuster in place for Supreme Court nominees.",
    " Title: Man Arrested in Washington D.C. Over Unfounded \"Pizzagate\" Conspiracy Theory\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 5 (UPI) \u2014 A North Carolina man was arrested in Washington, D.C., Sunday after he entered a popular pizzeria, Comet Ping Pong, carrying an assault rifle, intending to investigate an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton during the presidential election.\n\nEdgar Maddison Welch, the man in question, entered Comet Ping Pong Sunday afternoon with the intention of investigating the \"Pizzagate\" child sex ring conspiracy. He pointed his gun at an employee and apparently fired it into the ground before police arrested him. No one was injured, and Welch was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon.\n\nComet Ping Pong has been inundated with visitors seeking to verify the baseless \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory, which suggests that Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager, John Podesta, are involved in a child sex trafficking ring.\n\nOne woman, who declined to give her name, told WUSA-TV in November, \"They're putting a lot of curses and spells over the city. All this underground tunnel that helps them take the kids and transport them back and forth so they can do these rituals.\"\n\nDespite the lack of factual basis for the rumor, it was propagated by several conspiracy-minded media outlets and spawned a since-shuttered channel on Reddit. The restaurant has been subjected to threats and unsubstantiated stories about trafficking for weeks.\n\nThe restaurant's owners and employees are perplexed by the abuse they've endured, said Comet owner James Alefantis, for reasons including the restaurant not having a basement\u2014a key element in the conspiracy theory.\n\nThe restaurant's owners supported Clinton during the presidential election, which they believe may have played a role in the development of the conspiracy, considering even those close to President-elect Donald Trump have half-bought into the rumor.\n\n\"What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories comes with consequences,\" Alefantis said. \"I hope that those involved in fanning these flames will take a moment to contemplate what happened here today, and stop promoting these falsehoods right away.\"",
    " Title: US Customs and Border Protection Deploys Teargas Against Migrants in Tijuana, Incident Under Review\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the early hours of New Year's Day, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) deployed teargas towards a group of approximately 150 Central American migrants attempting to cross the border in Tijuana, Mexico. The incident, which has been met with controversy, is now under review by CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility.\n\nAccording to a statement released by CBP later on Tuesday, the teargas was aimed at rock throwers, not the migrants themselves. The statement read, \"No agents witnessed any of the migrants at the fence line, including children, experiencing effects of the chemical agents, which were targeted at the rock throwers further away.\"\n\nHowever, an Associated Press photographer reported seeing at least three volleys of gas launched onto the Mexican side of the border that affected migrants, including women and children, as well as journalists. The AP saw rocks thrown only after US agents fired the teargas.\n\nCBP stated that agents saw \"toddler-sized children\" being passed over concertina wire with difficulty. The agency claimed its agents could not assist the children due to the rocks being thrown. Agents responded with smoke, pepper spray, and teargas, according to the statement, and the AP journalist also observed plastic pellets fired by US agents.\n\nA total of 25 migrants were detained, while others retreated back into Mexico through a hole under the fence. The migrants interviewed by the AP had arrived in Tijuana last month as part of the caravan from Honduras.\n\nThe caravan, which grew to over 6,000 members during its month-and-a-half journey north, has been a recurring topic in the political discourse, with President Donald Trump frequently referring to it in the lead-up to the midterm elections in November.\n\nMany of the migrants are waiting in Tijuana for a chance to apply for asylum in the US, but the backlog is expected to result in a lengthy wait. Others have found employment in Mexico and are attempting to settle there.\n\nIn a previous incident on 26 November, US agents deployed teargas across the border after some migrants attempted to breach the border following a peaceful march in Tijuana. Hundreds of migrants who were downwind of the gas were affected.\n\nThe current standoff between President Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for the border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, is ongoing. The future of the Central American migrant caravan remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Facebook Executives' Campaign Contributions Raise Questions as Congress Prepares to Interrogate Zuckerberg on Privacy Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As members of the House and Senate committees prepare to question Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about user privacy protection next week, it has been revealed that these same committees are among the top recipients of campaign contributions from Facebook employees and the social network's political action committee (PAC).\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will question Zuckerberg on April 11, has received nearly $381,000 in contributions tied to Facebook since 2007, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which will hold a joint hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, has received $369,000. The Judiciary Committee members have received $235,000 in Facebook contributions.\n\nThe Energy and Commerce Committee's contributions are counter to the broader trend in Facebook campaign gifts, with Democrats receiving 65% of the $7 million in contributions to all federal candidates tied to the Menlo Park, Calif.-based social network, while Republicans received 33%. Of the 55 members on the Energy and Commerce Committee this year, all but nine have received Facebook contributions in the past decade.\n\nCommittee Chairman Greg Walden, R-Ore., received $27,000, while Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top-ranking Democrat, got $7,000. Walden and Pallone jointly announced that the committee on April 11 will question Zuckerberg \"to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues and help all Americans better understand what happens to their personal information online.\"\n\nFacebook's response to questions about the contributions was that the company develops relationships with elected officials who share its vision of an open internet. The company's PAC decisions about which candidates to support are based on whether their policy positions are consistent with the company's and whether the candidate holds a key committee or leadership position.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a member of both Senate committees that will question Zuckerberg on Tuesday, received a $15,000 contribution tied to Facebook in 2012, but nothing since then. Rep. O'Rourke, the Texas Democrat vying to unseat Cruz, is the fourth-highest recipient of contributions tied to Facebook in this election cycle, receiving nearly $13,000.\n\nFred Wertheimer, founder and president of the campaign finance reform advocacy group Democracy21, said having a committee that received the most contributions from Facebook question its top executive about a national controversy demonstrates why the system needs to be changed.\n\n\"Powerful interests provide lots of money to the committees that have jurisdiction over them, and they do it to gain influence with those members of Congress,\" Wertheimer said. \"It's a fundamental problem that exists throughout the system and throughout the committee structure, and it undermines public confidence that the members are going to make decisions in the best interests of the American people.\"\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet, another tech giant, gave more in the 2016 presidential race, $8.8 million, than Facebook's PAC and its employees gave in the past decade. The top House committee receiving Alphabet contributions that year was again the Energy and Commerce Committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics' data. Members of a handful of other Senate committees got more than members of the Senate Commerce or Judiciary committees, however.\n\nThe top recipient of Facebook contributions on the House commerce committee, receiving $51,050, was Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat whose district is adjacent to Facebook's headquarters and is home to many company employees. Eshoo narrowly lost a battle with Pallone for the top Democratic spot on the committee after the 2014 election.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who is not on the committee, got the most Facebook contributions in the House, totaling $55,150 since 2007. Overall, Facebook has contributed $1.1 million to House members, split almost evenly between the parties.\n\nIn addition to campaign contributions, Facebook spent $11.5 million lobbying Congress last year, and its total spending on lobbying since 2009 is nearly $52 million. Nearly 30 members of Congress own Facebook stock, according to a story in Roll Call, including two Democratic members of the committee who will question Zuckerberg next week. Massachusetts Rep. Joseph Kennedy's investment is worth at least $80,000 and is held in trust funds. Oregon Rep. Kurt Schrader's stake is worth at least $15,000.",
    " Title: Minimum Wage Hikes and Automation: A Closer Look at California's Experiment\n\nArticle:\n\nAs states like California and cities such as Seattle implement minimum wages of up to $15 an hour, critics voice concerns about potential job losses due to increased automation. Outlets like the Wall Street Journal and Forbes argue that higher minimum wages will lead to job loss via automation, with robots replacing human workers in industries like fast food.\n\nHowever, this perspective may be misguided. Firstly, there is no guarantee that increased minimum wages will accelerate the development and adoption of labor-saving technology. On the contrary, the implementation of higher minimum wages could incentivize the creation and adoption of high-quality new equipment to automate elements of industries like the food service industry, leading to a positive outcome.\n\nProductivity-enhancing technology is a crucial component of social and economic progress, and if minimum wage hikes do spur the creation and adoption of such technology, it would be a positive outcome. The concern about workers being replaced by robots is overblown, as many of these workers would find new jobs.\n\nRestaurants would likely keep longer hours, meaning many workers would get a raise and change shifts. The advanced robo-restaurant technology would itself be a valuable American export good, and people would be employed in designing and selling it. Some low-wage work would be reallocated out of the relatively low-social-value restaurant sector and into areas like child care and home health assistance, for which there is ample demand.\n\nMoreover, since poor people are now making more money, there will be opportunities to sell them things they could not previously afford, creating demand for new jobs. Even better, to the extent that we are able to produce everything we need with less labor, we can afford to let people work less.\n\nThe scenario to worry about with minimum wage hikes is that no technological solution will emerge. In this case, restaurant operations would remain the same, but employing people to work in them would get more expensive. In pricey, crowded cities, the results wouldn't be so bad. Operating a restaurant would become less lucrative, which in the long term would mean restaurateurs offer lower bids for leases on prime restaurant locations. That would mean lower returns for landlords, which is a small price to pay for better living standards for low-wage workers.\n\nHowever, in less crowded, less expensive locations where labor is a bigger slice of the overall cost pie, it would mean fewer restaurants open and those that do open would keep shorter hours. People would have a harder time finding jobs, not just super low-end jobs, but also better-paying managerial and construction jobs. Convenient meals would also be harder to come by.\n\nSome people would benefit through higher pay, but others would just find themselves unable to find work unless they move to a different state that's friendlier to opening new restaurants. Whether a legislative push for high pay can actually spur the development and deployment of new productivity-enhancing technology is really the big unknown about the minimum wage.\n\nThe economics literature has an enormous amount to say about how to efficiently distribute a fixed stock of resources, but has not really succeeded in shedding much light on where innovation comes from or what policies support it. Existing studies of the labor market impact of minimum wage hikes generally find very small effects on employment based on very small wage increases.\n\nThe question they ask is essentially whether a small hike in the wage floor introduces a small inefficiency into the labor market or whether it corrects for an existing inefficiency that gives employers some monopoly pricing power over workers. This is an interesting question, but the wage-innovation question is a much more difficult\u2014and yet important\u2014one.\n\nThe prevailing conventional wisdom in Western policy circles over the past generation has been that innovation is something that just happens. The government can help it along by providing an educated workforce and funding some basic R&D, but certainly cannot just summon productivity-enhancing technology into existence by waving a magic minimum wage wand. But that's really just an assumption, not a proven proposition.\n\nThe fact that so many minimum wage skeptics think it's intuitively wrong is telling and interesting. A cheap labor economy, after all, does not offer as many incentives for companies to identify and promote managers who are skilled at finding, developing, and deploying labor-saving technology. Perhaps if a large, dynamic, and innovative state like California forces companies to eschew cheap labor, they will respond by innovating and reducing their need for workers.\n\nAt least, residents of inland California had better hope that happens. Otherwise, they'll be packing their bags for Texas.",
    " Title: Clinton's Exclusive Use of Personal Email During Tenure as Secretary of State Raises Questions of Transparency and Compliance with Federal Records Act\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a revelation that has sparked controversy and raised questions about transparency and compliance with federal records laws, a new report by the New York Times has revealed that Hillary Clinton, during her four-year tenure as Secretary of State, exclusively used a personal email account for her official government business.\n\nAccording to State Department officials, Clinton did not have a government email address during her time at the State Department. Her aides took no actions to have her personal emails preserved on department servers at the time, as required by the Federal Records Act.\n\nThe expansive use of the private account was alarming to current and former National Archives and Records Administration officials and government watchdogs, who called it a serious breach. This is not the first time the Obama administration has been caught evading federal records laws by using personal email, a practice that ultimately allows officials to escape scrutiny under the Freedom of Information Act and Congressional investigation.\n\nThe existence of Clinton's personal email account was discovered as a House committee investigating the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi sought correspondence between Clinton and her aides about the attack. The Benghazi Select Committee, headed by Congressman Trey Gowdy, is continuing its investigation.\n\nAs Clinton may have violated federal requirements that officials' correspondence be retained as part of the agency's record, her non-transparency and years of federal law violation could potentially become a significant issue should she announce a run for the White House in April. This development adds another layer of complexity to Clinton's political future, as she navigates the potential consequences of her email practices during her time as Secretary of State.",
    " Title: Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan Passes Away at 80\n\nArticle:\n\nThe world mourns the passing of former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who died on Saturday at the age of 80 following a brief illness. Annan, the seventh UN Secretary-General, served two terms between 1997 and 2006. He was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with the UN in 2001 for his humanitarian work.\n\nAnnan's family and foundation announced his death in a statement on Twitter. He passed away peacefully in a hospital in Bern, Switzerland, with his wife, Nane, and three children, Ama, Kojo, and Nina, by his side. Annan had retired to Geneva and later lived in a Swiss village.\n\nThe statement from Annan's foundation described him as a \"global statesman and deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer and more peaceful world.\" The current UN Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, praised Annan, stating, \"In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organization into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination.\"\n\nFormer UK Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed his shock and distress at Annan's death, while current UK Prime Minister Theresa May and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn also paid tribute to Annan on Twitter. World leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Nelson Mandela's The Elders, also mourned Annan's passing.\n\nBorn in Kumasi, Ghana, on April 8, 1938, Annan joined the UN system in 1962 as an administrative officer with the World Health Organization in Geneva. He later served with the Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa, the UN Emergency Force in Ismailia, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva, and in several senior posts at its headquarters in New York.\n\nAnnan's tenure as Secretary-General, which began six years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and also covered the 9/11 attacks and subsequent US-led war against Iraq, was one of the UN's most turbulent periods since its founding in 1945. His leadership was marked by two of the UN's most criticized incidents during the Rwanda genocide in 1994 and the massacre in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in July 1995.\n\nAnnan's legacy is complex, with his tenure tarnished by a 2005 investigation of Annan and his son over the \"oil-for-food\" scandal. However, he was cleared of any serious wrongdoing, and his humanitarian work and dedication to peace and human rights will be remembered. As a global statesman, Kofi Annan leaves behind a lasting impact on the world.",
    " Title: Obama Authorizes Direct Military Action in Iraq to Avert Humanitarian Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a swift response to the escalating crisis in Iraq, President Barack Obama has authorized direct military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), following a series of coordinated attacks that threatened both American personnel and the Yazidi religious minority in the region.\n\nThe threat of a double disaster this week compelled President Obama to take action he had hoped to avoid - the use of force in Iraq. American warplanes, based in the Middle East, are now authorized to attack ISIL fighters, as announced by Obama on Thursday night. The primary objectives are to protect American personnel and facilities in Erbil, and to prevent the systematic murder of tens of thousands of Yazidis, an ancient religious minority facing genocide.\n\nIf ISIL approaches Erbil or if there is a risk of American intervention to free the Yazidis, U.S. military warplanes will be authorized to engage in combat. As of early Friday, no such attacks had been reported, but the rapidly evolving situation made it uncertain when such strikes might occur.\n\n\"If we see actions anywhere in Iraq that threaten our personnel or facilities, we stand prepared to take targeted action to protect them,\" one senior administration official said. The president has made it clear that no scenario will involve large numbers of combat troops returning to Iraq.\n\nObama has refrained from taking \"kinetic\" military action since Mosul and much of northern Iraq fell to ISIL last month. The U.S. wants Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki out of power, and White House press secretary Josh Earnest stated earlier this week that the U.S. did not want any government in Baghdad to rely on American military power.\n\nHowever, as the danger of atrocities has grown, Obama has decided to act. \"When we face a situation like we do on that mountain - with innocent people facing the prospect of violence on a horrific scale, when we have a mandate to help - in this case, a request from the Iraqi government - and when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America can not turn a blind eye,\" Obama said. \"We can act, carefully and responsibly, to prevent a potential act of genocide. That's what we're doing on that mountain.\"\n\nThree Air Force cargo planes dropped food and water to sustain the Yazidis, and the Defense Department is prepared to launch another airdrop if necessary. Two Navy F/A-18 Hornet fighters escorted the cargo aircraft, and a defense official confirmed that the fighters would be ready in case ISIL targeted the resupply aircraft.\n\nThe exact air defense capabilities of the Sunni fighters have been a question mark, as American officials in Washington have considered how or whether to use American air power in Iraq. The U.S. never sold Iraq shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, officials say, but they are unsure about the weapons ISIL obtained when it scattered Iraq's army in June, or what weapons it has been able to export from its other theater of operations in Syria.\n\nWhile national security officials have made it clear they are ready to resupply and attack if ordered, White House officials also emphasized that Obama's orders are narrowly focused. \"We are not launching a sustained campaign against ISIL here,\" said one official. The overall administration message remains the same: The U.S. cannot bomb its way out of the Iraq crisis. Only Baghdad can end the dilemma by forming an inclusive government, officials insisted, one that will enfranchise Iraq's Sunnis and other minorities and encourage them to turn away from extremist forces like ISIL.\n\n\"An enduring solution to the persistent threat posed by ISIL will require further reconciliation among Iraqi communities and strengthened Iraqi security forces,\" said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. However, the White House also acknowledged that even if Baghdad overcomes its political dysfunction, its military would still face a daunting task in retaking the territory ISIL has claimed.\n\nObama's critics in Congress were not appeased by the president's decisions. Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, two outspoken Republican hawks, criticized what they called the president's policy of \"half measures.\"\n\n\"We need a strategic approach, not just a humanitarian one,\" they said. \"A policy of containment will not work against ISIS. It is inherently expansionist and must be stopped. The longer we wait to act, the worse this threat will become, as recent events clearly show.\"\n\nMcCain and Graham, along with other conservative critics, charged that Obama's policy of disengagement in the Middle East has caused the crises in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere to worsen without strong American action.\n\n\"If ever there were a time to reevaluate our disastrous policy in the Middle East, this is it,\" they said. \"Because of the President's hands-off approach, the threats in the region have grown and now directly threaten the United States. We are already paying a very heavy price for our inaction, and if we do not change course, the costs of our inaction will only grow.\"",
    " Title: The 113th Congress: A Record-Breaking Low in Legislative Activity\n\nThe 113th Congress, currently in session, is on track to become the least productive Congress in history, with only 49 laws enacted so far, according to the Congressional Record. This is the fewest number of laws enacted since at least 1947, when the Congressional Record began tallying legislative activity on a yearly basis.\n\nThe slow pace of legislating is due in part to the strained relationship between President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans, which has led to the first government shutdown in 17 years last month and flirtations with a historic debt default. The dysfunction is evident in the face of significant issues such as a $17 trillion national debt, the ongoing rollout of the health care law, and overseas threats from countries like Iran.\n\nSenate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) commented on the lack of achievements, stating, \"If I look at the last 12 weeks, we can count on one hand what we\u2019ve achieved.\" He added, \"We put the government back in business thank goodness, but beyond that the strategic helium reserve bill is really the centerpiece of what we\u2019ve done.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, there is still hope for some major bills to pass, including the overdue overhaul of farm policies, the annual defense policy bill, the comprehensive immigration bill, a budget deal, and an omnibus spending package. However, the emotional politics of an immigration overhaul may derail it next year, and any budget deal is expected to be limited in scope.\n\nThe farm bill's chances for passage this year took a significant hit this week, and the defense bill's prospects are uncertain, with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) stating, \"I do not know if it will be done.\"\n\nThe structural differences in the schedules of the GOP-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate contribute to the difficulty in achieving bicameral meetings and consensus-building sessions. The Senate's work schedule, for instance, is not conducive to productive legislating, with the Senate barely working on Fridays and being in session for legislative business on just seven Fridays in 2013.\n\nThe 113th Congress's record-breaking low in legislative activity is a cause for concern for many, as the country faces numerous pressing issues that require immediate attention and action. The hope remains that the remaining legislative session will yield more productive results, but the outlook is uncertain.",
    " Title: CNN Poll Shows 2014 Midterm Elections Tightening, Suggesting Volatility in Voter Preferences\n\nArticle:\n\nA new CNN poll indicates that the 2014 midterm elections are now a toss-up, with the Republicans narrowly leading Democrats by 49% to 47%. This 10-point swing in public opinion, which follows a comfortable lead for Democrats just a month ago, serves as a reminder that voter preferences can be volatile and are often influenced by current events.\n\nAccording to political analyst Tim Stanley, the rise and fall of President Obama's coalition is not a historical inevitability but a product of temporary trends. The shutdown, which was widely criticized, and the ongoing issues with the implementation of Obamacare have contributed to this shift in public opinion.\n\nThe shutdown, which ended in October, was met with widespread disapproval, with eight in ten voters disapproving of the tactic, including two in three Republicans or independents who lean Republican. However, the Democratic triumphalism following the shutdown was short-lived, as the latest polling shows a turnaround.\n\nTwo election results in recent months have prefigured this turnaround. In one, Chris Christie won a massive 2-1 victory, making significant inroads into groups thought to be beyond the right's reach, such as women, Hispanics, and African-Americans. In another, an unpopular ultraconservative Republican, Ken Cuccinelli, lost his gubernatorial race in Virginia but only by a small margin, despite being hugely outspent.\n\nChristie's win was likely driven by his personal appeal to voters, but the outcome of the Virginia contest may have been influenced by public annoyance over the botched rollout of the Obamacare exchanges. The website's troubles and the disappointing discovery that millions could lose their existing coverage have contributed to a decline in Obama's approval rating, which is now at its lowest since he took office.\n\nThe conclusion at the National Journal is that \"race-by-race polling conducted over the last month has painted a grim picture of the difficult environment Senate Democrats are facing next year.\" However, the key word in all this data seems to be \"volatility.\" Voters are fed up with Congress and disappointed in Obama. Who ends up benefiting from the misery will be down to events and good timing.\n\nIn other words, while the public turned against the Republicans over the shutdown, they just as easily - and quickly - turned against the Democrats over health care. The health care issue has a more direct impact upon their lives, which means its long-term resonance is likely to be greater. The idea that Barack Obama established a new New Deal coalition in 2012 that can't be broken by conservative politicians is clearly nonsense.",
    " Title: Samsung Develops Deepfake Technology Capable of Creating Realistic Videos with Minimal Data\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a groundbreaking development, Samsung has unveiled a new artificial intelligence system that can generate deepfake videos using as little as one photograph. The technology, which was detailed in a paper earlier this week, has the potential to revolutionize the creation of deepfake videos, making them easier to produce and harder to detect.\n\nThe technology, which Samsung's AI lab in Russia has dubbed \"realistic neural talking heads,\" can create convincing moving and speaking human likenesses. The system works by using machine learning to fabricate a moving, speaking human, similar to the video boxes of pundits you see on TV news.\n\nThe researchers behind the technology see its applications in various fields, including video games, film and TV, video conferencing, and the special effects industry. The paper was accompanied by a video showcasing the team's creations, which also featured a disconcertingly chill-vibes soundtrack.\n\nUnlike traditional deepfake videos, the results from a single or small number of images end up fudging fine details. For example, a fake of Marilyn Monroe in the Samsung lab's demo video missed the icon's famous mole. The synthesized videos tend to retain some semblance of whoever played the digital puppet, according to Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor at the University at Albany in New York who specializes in media forensics and machine learning.\n\nThe few-shot or one-shot aspect of this approach is useful because it means a large network can be trained on a large number of videos, which is the part that takes a long time. This kind of system can then quickly adapt to a new target person using only a few images without extensive retraining, saving time in concept and making the model generalizable.\n\nHowever, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence means that any time a researcher shares a breakthrough in deepfake creation, bad actors can begin scraping together their own jury-rigged tools to mimic it. Samsung's techniques are likely to find their way into more people's hands before long.\n\nThe glitches in the fake videos made with Samsung's new approach may be clear and obvious. But they'll be cold comfort to anybody who ends up in a deepfake generated from that one smiling photo posted to Facebook.",
    " Title: Parliamentary Committee Warns of \"Democratic Crisis\" in the UK, Calls for Tougher Regulation of Social Media Companies\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United Kingdom is facing a \"democratic crisis\" as voters are being targeted with \"pernicious views\" and data is being manipulated, a parliamentary committee is set to warn. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee has been investigating disinformation and fake news following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.\n\nIn its first report, MPs will suggest that social media companies should face tougher regulation or a new tax. The MPs' report comes after months of investigating the impact of technology giants and how people are affected by the rise in fake news on social media. It also probed whether Russia had a role in influencing voters in the EU referendum.\n\nThe committee's report was due to be officially published on Sunday, but a copy was leaked on Friday by Dominic Cummings, the director of the official Brexit campaign group Vote Leave, who published it on his own blog. Mr. Cummings was asked and officially summoned to take part in the inquiry to respond to allegations made against the Vote Leave campaign, but he refused. Mr. Cummings called the report \"fake news.\"\n\nAccording to the leaked report, MPs say \"our democracy is at risk and now is the time to act.\" The committee highlights the \"relentless targeting of hyper-partisan views, which play to the fears and prejudices of people, in order to influence their voting plans.\"\n\nThe report is expected to be very critical of Facebook, which has been under increased scrutiny following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. \"Facebook has hampered our efforts to get information about their company throughout this inquiry. It is as if it thinks that the problem will go away if it does not share information about the problem, and reacts only when it is pressed,\" it will say.\n\n\"It provided witnesses who have been unwilling or unable to give full answers to the committee's questions,\" it will repeat its call for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence. The committee's report will also say it had received \"disturbing evidence\" of hacking, disinformation, and voter suppression in elections since 2010.\n\n\"We urge the government to ensure that the National Crime Agency thoroughly investigates these allegations,\" the report will say. Social media sites should be held responsible for \"harmful\" content on their services, the report is expected to say. Companies such as Facebook and YouTube have repeatedly said they are just a \"platform\" rather than a \"publisher.\" They have argued that they are not responsible for the content people post on their services.\n\nThe committee's report is expected to say that social media companies \"can not hide behind\" this claim. A \"new category of tech company\" which is something in between a platform or publisher should be created, the committee will suggest. This should establish \"clear legal liability for the tech companies to act against harmful and illegal content on their platforms.\"\n\nThe rules on political campaigns should be made fit for the digital age. The committee will say that electoral law needs to be \"updated to reflect changes in campaigning techniques.\" Creating a public register for political advertising so that anybody can see what messages are being distributed online political advertisements should have a digital imprint stating who was responsible, as is required with printed leaflets and advertisements.\n\nSocial media sites should be held responsible for interference in elections by malicious actors. Electoral fraud fines should be increased from a maximum of \u00a320,000 to a percentage of an organization's annual turnover. The report will suggest that an independent body such as the Competition and Markets Authority should audit the social networks.\n\nIt will say that security mechanisms and algorithms used by social networks should be available for audit by a government regulator, to ensure they are \"operating responsibly.\" The committee will also warn that fake accounts on sites such as Facebook and Twitter \"not only damage the user experience, but potentially defraud advertisers\" who could be paying to advertise to accounts not run by real people.\n\nTech companies should be taxed to fund education and regulation. Tighter regulation of social media sites would mean more work for organizations such as the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The committee will suggest a tax on tech companies. Some of the money should fund the extra responsibilities of the regulators. The rest of the money should be spent on digital education in schools and a public awareness campaign, to help people identify disinformation and fake news.\n\n\"Digital literacy should be the fourth pillar of education, alongside reading, writing, and maths,\" the report will say. The report will also summarize the evidence collected during the committee's inquiry, which was launched in September last year. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie and Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix were among the 61 witnesses that gave evidence.\n\nTom Baldwin, who has written a book on the relationship between politics and media, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the report's recommendations did not go far enough. \"The social media ads that were seen used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever invented,\" Mr. Baldwin said.\n\nWill Moy, the head of fact-checking charity Full Fact, told the BBC that the same conversation about fake news is going on around the world - and the reaction of some governments had been \"quite scary.\" He said MPs should acknowledge that it is important to also \"stand proudly on being an open society and valuing free speech.\"\n\nRules for political advertising have become out of date because they do not work for online, and the transparency of where adverts come from should be available immediately, he added. Meanwhile, Jamie Bartlett, the head of think tank Demos, said the report is about the \"long-term integrity of elections\" so people \"trust they are getting accurate information.\"\n\nHe said he fears the Brexit debate could distract the focus of the issue. \"So those who are pro-Brexit will dismiss a lot of it, those who are anti-Brexit will say 'this is why we should have another referendum,' and then we miss what is essentially far more important: The long-term health of democracy.\" The committee's final report is expected before the end of the year. Facebook and Twitter have yet to respond to a request for comment.",
    " Title: Shutdown's Impact on Veterans and Military Families: A Call for Action Amidst Political Posturing\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing partial government shutdown has brought forth a series of tragic and disheartening news for America's veterans, troops, and their families. This week, the Department of Defense announced it would be unable to pay the $100,000 death gratuity benefit to support families of the fallen, a decision that has been met with widespread condemnation.\n\nNick McCormick, a veteran and advocate, expressed his dismay, stating that a temporary fix does not fully undo the impact of the shutdown. He emphasized that what is needed is action to end the shutdown, not political posturing.\n\nThe news of the cutoff in death benefits, a fraction of the Defense Department's budget, has left grieving families in needless pain. The government's inability to foresee and address this lack of funding has raised questions about the sincerity of its support for America's troops and veterans.\n\nIn response, politicians from both parties have rushed to denounce the decision and call for the benefits to be reinstated. The strong words and bipartisan support highlight the issue's urgency, yet veterans are left wondering if the pledges of support are genuine or merely symbolic fallback issues for legislators during tough governing times.\n\nThe military charity Fisher House Foundation has stepped up to cover these benefits for the Pentagon until the problem is solved. However, the question remains: why is such sharp and decisive action only taken on a limited basis, especially when it involves veterans and the military community?\n\nThe shutdown has also brought renewed attention to the World War II Memorial, a symbol of the sacrifices made by the \"greatest generation.\" Despite the site being supposed to be off-limits during the shutdown, 92 World War II veterans visiting from Mississippi made headlines by breaking through barricades to pay homage to their fallen comrades.\n\nThe image of these veterans, who endured hardship, tragedy, and suffering, breaking through yellow tape and metal barricades, has gone viral, prompting members of Congress from both parties to attach themselves to the fight.\n\nThe shutdown has generated a style of bandwagon politics that is getting stale. Instead of focusing on solving the problems that led to the shutdown, politicians are conveniently highlighting veterans and military families without addressing the root cause: ending the shutdown.\n\nThe threat for veterans and military families is all too real. Denial of some services and lingering doubt about the future will only add more financial and emotional anguish to a community that has already endured war for more than a dozen years.\n\nOn social media via #Shutdownstories and calls to Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America case managers, we hear from veterans in the Veterans Affairs backlog who will have to spend more time waiting for a claims decision than they spent in combat zones.\n\nVeterans who make up 27% of the federal workforce are now furloughed. National Guard drills are being rescheduled or canceled in many states, affecting troop readiness and pay. On base, services that military families count on are now closed. Veterans who rely on disability and GI Bill benefits are facing the very real possibility of not getting their benefits next month, as Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki testified Wednesday.\n\nPhoto-ops, shouting matches, and gimmicks will not help veterans and military families who are hurting during the shutdown. These political events provide no long-term benefits for the military community and get us nowhere closer to ending a shutdown that is inflicting real pain on the men and women who fought for our country.\n\nThe political games and posturing need to end. Make no mistake that veterans and military families appreciate compliments and expressions of support and gratitude\u2014but what we need most right now are solutions.",
    " Title: Divisive Trends in U.S. Politics: The Impact of Republican-led State Governments\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark display of the political divide in the United States, Republican-controlled state governments have been advancing conservative agendas that contrast sharply with the progressive policies of blue states. This polarization, which mirrors the political landscape in Washington, is particularly evident in North Carolina, where the recent veto of an anti-LGBT rights bill by Governor Nathan Deal came only after corporate intervention.\n\nThe controversial bill, passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature, would have prohibited transgender individuals from using bathrooms that align with their gender identity and prevented local governments from outlawing discrimination against LGBT citizens. This legislation, which has been widely criticized as discriminatory, is emblematic of the anti-LGBT rights stance of many Republican-controlled governments.\n\nThe North Carolina example underscores a broader trend in the United States, where the political landscape is increasingly divided along ideological lines. In blue states, citizens are protected against discrimination, social safety nets are strengthened, reproductive rights are respected, and voting rights are expanded. In contrast, in red states, the opposite is occurring.\n\nAbortion restrictions, such as the recent ban on abortions in cases of fetal disability in Indiana and the ending of state funding for preventive health services at medical centers where abortions occur in Florida, are becoming more common in states with Republican control. The Supreme Court is currently debating new restrictions in Texas that threaten to close most of the state's abortion clinics.\n\nMoreover, 19 states, many of which are controlled by Republicans, have yet to accept Medicaid expansion, a key component of Obamacare. Meanwhile, blue states like Oregon and California have passed laws mandating automatic voter registration, while 16 states, primarily controlled by Republicans, have enacted new voter ID laws, restricted early voting, and eliminated same-day registration.\n\nThe impact of GOP dominance on the state level can also be seen in areas such as education, welfare, and social services. In blue states, Medicaid and welfare benefits are more generous, public schools are better-funded, and there is more support for child care, family leave, foster care programs, and services for the homeless and people with disabilities. In contrast, benefits are smaller, government services less plentiful and poorly funded, and basic freedoms like reproductive rights and voting are more restricted in red states.\n\nExamples of this trend can be seen in states like Kansas and Louisiana, where new governors have prioritized tax cuts, particularly for the states' highest earners. The result has been devastating, with state agencies cutting their workforces, reduced funding for youth services, mental health treatment, and higher education in Louisiana, and a similarly dire situation in Kansas.\n\nEven in purple or blue states, once Republicans take control, they have wasted little time in pushing through a conservative agenda. In Ohio, Governor John Kasich has signed nearly 20 laws restricting abortion rights. In Michigan, GOP Governor Rick Snyder privatized key public services, contributing to the Flint lead water crisis. In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker rammed through legislation undermining labor protections soon after taking office.\n\nAs the nation's politics become more divided and Washington becomes increasingly dysfunctional, ideologically orthodox conservative Republicans are aggressively pushing their agenda on the state level. The consequences for those living in red state America could hardly be more dire.",
    " Title: Boehner Denies Plans for Impeachment of President Obama; House GOP Focuses on Lawsuit Against White House\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement to reporters on Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner flatly denied that congressional Republicans are moving to impeach President Barack Obama, labeling such talk as a \"scam started by Democrats at the White House.\" Boehner emphasized that the House GOP has no plans to impeach the President, stating, \"We have no plans to impeach the President. We have no future plans.\"\n\nBoehner attributed the talk of impeachment to \"the President's own staff\" and congressional Democrats, who he believes are using the issue to rally support for the upcoming elections. The House Speaker's comments come after a recent CNN-ORC opinion poll showed that almost two-thirds of Americans do not believe Obama deserves to be impeached.\n\nDespite the denial of impeachment plans, the issue has been a topic of discussion due to the ongoing lawsuit filed by Boehner against Obama over executive actions. The lawsuit, which was designed to address outrage from tea party activists and others within the GOP base, covers Obama's decision last year to defer a health law requirement that businesses provide insurance coverage to their employees.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit has opened the door to more discussion about impeaching the second-straight Democratic president by a Republican-led House. The issue was magnified when incoming House GOP whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana refused to take the issue off the table during an interview over the weekend.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has capitalized on the issue, raising nearly $7.6 million ahead of the November midterms since Boehner announced his lawsuit. The campaign arm has pulled in $1 million alone since Scalise's comments on impeachment over the weekend.\n\nWith the resolution to formally authorize the lawsuit expected on the House floor on Wednesday, House Democrats are likely to continue to argue that the move is simply the first step toward impeachment, regardless of Boehner's comments. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid raised the subject on the Senate floor on Tuesday, stating, \"We should not be off on those tracks of impeachment and suing the President. We should be legislating.\"",
    " Title: Telecom Industry Challenges Maine's Broadband User Privacy Law, Citing Free Speech Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, the broadband industry has filed a lawsuit against the state of Maine over a new law aimed at protecting broadband user privacy. The lawsuit, which was first reported by Ars Technica, claims that the law violates the industry's free speech rights.\n\nThe Maine law, passed last June, requires Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to clearly disclose what data they collect and who it is sold to. It also mandates that users opt in to the sale of sensitive location or financial data, and bans ISPs from charging extra for privacy protection. This law was a response to practices such as AT&T's charging customers extra for privacy protection, a practice that had been in place for years.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the broadband industry, argues that Maine's law \"imposes unprecedented and unduly burdensome restrictions on ISPs' protected speech.\" The lawsuit further claims that the law represents discrimination between similarly situated speakers that is impermissible under the First Amendment.\n\nHowever, telecom experts argue that the industry is grasping at straws as it attempts to dodge accountability for a decade of telecom-related privacy abuses. Gigi Sohn, a former FCC lawyer, told Motherboard, \"Big broadband is clearly trying untested First Amendment arguments in the hope that something sticks.\"\n\nSohn noted that the lawsuit is part of a broader effort by the industry to eliminate all meaningful state and federal consumer protections. In 2017, telecom lobbyists convinced the Trump FCC to not only kill net neutrality but also to eliminate most of the FCC's telecom consumer protection authority. As a result, the FCC's apathy has allowed ISPs to engage in practices such as charging consumers rental fees for modems they already own, or jacking up subscriber bills via a bevy of bogus fees and surcharges.\n\nIn response to federal apathy, states including Washington, California, and Maine passed their own privacy and net neutrality laws. While the industry has complained about this creating a confusing \"patchwork quilt\" of state consumer protections, Sohn argues that this problem is one of the industry's own making. \"The so-called 'problem' of state broadband privacy laws like Maine's is one of the ISPs' own making,\" Sohn said. \"They asked Congress to repeal the FCC's modest and popular 2016 broadband privacy rules, got their wish, and now are upset that states want to fill the gap.\"\n\nBlake Reid, Associate Clinical Professor at Colorado Law, told Motherboard that the industry's lawsuit is another example of the sector trying to have its cake and eat it too. \"It is bad enough that ISPs lobbied to repeal the FCC's robust broadband privacy rules; they now have the temerity to pretend that the near-total vacuum of privacy protections for ISP customers at the federal level constitutes some kind of 'uniform' federal approach to privacy with which Maine's law could conflict,\" Reid said.\n\nWith former Verizon lawyers now in charge of both the FCC (Ajit Pai) and DOJ (Bill Barr), the federal government has further aided the telecom sector by suing states like California for attempting to protect consumers on issues like net neutrality. \"It should be no surprise to ISPs that states like Maine have stepped in to fill the void, and ISPs can hardly claim that having to protect their customers' privacy conflicts with their non-obligations to do essentially nothing at all under federal law,\" Reid said.\n\nIn conclusion, the telecom sector not only enjoys little to no competition in broadband, but the industry has waged an all-out war to effectively eliminate all state and federal oversight of one of the most broken and disliked industries in America. The question remains: What could possibly go wrong?",
    " Title: The Rise of Polarization: A Closer Look at Free Speech and Political Tactics in Modern America\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the current political climate of the United States, the concept of free speech has become a contentious issue, with accusations of censorship and suppression of opposing viewpoints being leveled by both sides of the political spectrum. A recent analysis suggests that free speech has, by default, become a conservative idea, with liberals increasingly resorting to tactics aimed at silencing their opposition rather than engaging in open debate.\n\nThis article explores seven key tactics employed by liberals to advance their ideas and stifle conservative viewpoints:\n\n1. Libsplaining: A term coined to describe the liberal tendency to reinterpret conservative viewpoints, often in a negative or misleading manner. This practice allows liberals to present their own interpretations as the truth, shaping public opinion without engaging in substantive debate.\n\n2. Violence: Some liberal activists, such as those affiliated with Antifa, have resorted to violence to silence conservative voices. These groups target individuals they disagree with, using threats and intimidation to discourage conservative participation in public discourse.\n\n3. De-Platforming: Liberals have taken control of various media outlets and social media platforms, limiting the reach of conservative viewpoints by banning or censoring conservative voices.\n\n4. Political Correctness, Safe Spaces, and Microaggressions: These tactics are used to silence individuals who express opinions that liberals find offensive. Examples include the creation of safe spaces and the implementation of microaggression policies, which aim to protect individuals from ideas or words that might cause emotional discomfort.\n\n5. Liberal Fakes: The mainstream media often features conservative voices who are, in reality, moderate or liberal in their beliefs. These individuals are used to give the impression of balanced coverage, while in reality, they often reinforce liberal viewpoints.\n\n6. False Labeling: Liberals are accused of labeling their opponents as white supremacists, Nazis, or racists, even when the evidence for such labels is tenuous or non-existent.\n\n7. The Ventriloquist Dummy: Liberals often elevate certain individuals, such as David Hogg and the Parkland students, to speak on behalf of their cause, shielding them from criticism due to their tragic experiences. This tactic is used to sway public opinion and stifle opposing viewpoints.\n\nThe article concludes by emphasizing the importance of open and honest debate in a democratic society, and the dangers of stifling free speech and the exchange of ideas. It calls for a more nuanced understanding of political differences and a commitment to engaging in respectful, constructive dialogue.",
    " Title: NPR Battleground Map: Hillary Clinton Gains Significant Lead Over Donald Trump in Latest Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the latest NPR analysis of polling, demographics, and on-the-ground reporting, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has solidified a substantial lead over Republican nominee Donald Trump. If the election were held today, Clinton would win in a landslide of 2008 proportions, according to the NPR Battleground Map.\n\nThe map shows Clinton winning with just states where she already has a significant lead, meaning she could potentially lose all toss-up states such as Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada, and Georgia, and still secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. The current tally shows Clinton with 273 electoral votes and Trump with 174.\n\nTrump's campaign has been marred by a series of missteps, including feuds with the family of an Army captain who was killed in Iraq, declining to support key Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan, joking about \"Second Amendment people\" taking action against Clinton, and accusing President Obama and Clinton of founding ISIS. He also caused controversy by suggesting a crying baby be removed from a rally, later saying he would \"sponsor\" the baby, who he said would one day sing in Philharmonic Hall.\n\nThese missteps have led to key voting groups moving more toward Clinton, particularly white, college-educated voters, who are found in important areas such as the suburbs of Philadelphia, Denver, and Northern Virginia.\n\nThe past month has been particularly challenging for Trump, with few things remaining constant almost three months out from Election Day. The next big opportunities for Trump to change the dynamics are the debates, with the first scheduled for Sept. 26 on Long Island, N.Y., followed by the vice presidential debate on Oct. 4 in Virginia, the second presidential debate on Oct. 9 in St. Louis, and the final debate 10 days later in Las Vegas.\n\nThe NPR analysis also shows some movement in traditionally red states, with Georgia moving to toss-up from lean Republican, Utah moving to lean Republican from likely Republican, and one electoral vote in Nebraska moving to toss-up from lean Republican.\n\nIn Georgia, which Obama only lost by 5 points in 2008, some polls are showing Clinton in the lead, though both candidates are only in the low 40s. History suggests this state will likely move back to the Republican column, but for now, it is a toss-up.\n\nIn Utah, another poll showed Clinton and Trump within a couple of points of each other. There are still a large number of undecided voters, and the impact of third-party candidate Gary Johnson is a key question. If Johnson can reach the high teens or 20 points, there is a path for Clinton to win Utah.\n\nIn Nebraska, which splits its votes by congressional district, Obama won the Omaha-area district in 2008, and the Democratic House incumbent Brad Ashford is favored there. The state's other districts are more Republican, but the Omaha-based billionaire Warren Buffett is promising to help Clinton there.\n\nDespite Trump's recent struggles, he has held up in a couple of states that were lean Democratic - Florida and Nevada - which have moved to toss-up now. Given demographics and Clinton's turnout operation, both states could be favorable for Clinton. However, the Republican National Committee has moved staff to Florida to try to save the state.\n\nThe NPR Battleground Map shows Clinton with a significant lead over Trump, but the dynamics of the race could change in the coming months, particularly with the upcoming debates.",
    " Title: The Inner Chimp and the Struggle for Humanity: Navigating Political Tribalism and Social Interactions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the acclaimed novel Dune, a character alludes to the human species' close relationship with animals, suggesting that humanity may be more similar to these creatures than one might initially think. This notion is further supported by genetic studies, which reveal that humans share a significant portion of their DNA with both orangutans and chimpanzees. This genetic similarity underscores the complex and often paradoxical nature of human behavior.\n\nThe recent incident involving Ivanka Trump and her family on a JetBlue flight serves as a stark reminder of the inner chimp that can emerge in unexpected situations. The altercation, instigated by Matthew Lasner and his husband, Daniel Goldstein, highlights the potential for conflict and confrontation that can arise from political differences and tribalistic tendencies.\n\nWhile it is easy to become embroiled in the emotions and allegiances that define our political landscape, it is essential to remember that we are called to be something more than our emotions and appetites. In the midst of political polarization and tribalism, it is crucial to maintain a sense of humanity and respect for others, even those with opposing viewpoints.\n\nManners, often overlooked, serve as a means of preventing violence and promoting peace. They are not merely aesthetic considerations but rather a way of making others feel valued, respected, and considered. By adhering to social codes and rituals, we can avoid the pitfalls of our baser instincts and strive to be more than our tribal affiliations.\n\nAs we approach the holiday season, it is a time to reflect on what it means to be human, in the flesh. It is a time to let go of our emotional and allegiance-driven responses and instead, choose to extend kindness, understanding, and respect to those around us. In doing so, we can help to maintain the peace and foster a more harmonious society.\n\nUltimately, the struggle between our better angels and our inner chimp is a constant one, but by choosing to act with humanity and manners, we can pass for human most of the time. It is a choice that requires conscious effort, but one that is well worth making in the pursuit of a more peaceful and cooperative world.",
    " Title: Social Media and the \"Spiral of Silence\": A Study on Public Opinion and Online Expression\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study by the Pew Research Internet Project has shed light on the role of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter in shaping public discourse, particularly on controversial issues. The study, which surveyed 1,801 adults, found that individuals are less likely to express their opinions on divisive topics like Edward Snowden's NSA revelations online than they are in person.\n\nThe research indicates that people are more inclined to voice their opinions if they believe others share their views. Those who frequently use Facebook and Twitter are less likely to share their opinions offline, with a person who checks Facebook multiple times a day being half as likely to express their opinion offline as someone who does not use the site as frequently.\n\nThe study refers to this phenomenon as the \"spiral of silence,\" a term that suggests people may choose not to speak up due to fear of isolation, a desire to maintain friendships, or the observation of minority opinions being met with ostracism online, which may discourage opinion sharing in physical settings.\n\nHowever, the study also acknowledges that the focus on a single policy issue and the influence of factors such as confidence in one's knowledge and opinions are limitations of the research.\n\nWhile the study suggests that the \"spiral of silence\" may be a factor in the lack of diverse opinions expressed online, it also raises the question of whether the abundance of repetitive, echo-chamber-like discussions on social media may contribute to a general fatigue among users, leading them to avoid contributing to the noise, both online and off.\n\nIn other words, the study suggests that the problem may not be the \"spiral of silence,\" but rather the overwhelming amount of similar viewpoints and repetitive discussions that users encounter on social media. This could lead to a sense of exhaustion, disinterest, or a desire to avoid contributing to the perceived cacophony of opinions.\n\nIn conclusion, the study offers valuable insights into the role of social media in shaping public discourse and the factors that influence individuals' willingness to express their opinions, both online and off. The findings suggest that the \"spiral of silence\" may be a factor, but the study also raises questions about the impact of repetitive, echo-chamber-like discussions on social media users' willingness to engage in discourse.",
    " Title: U.S. Needs Enhanced Counterterrorism Strategy in North Africa: Analysts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent kidnapping of hundreds of schoolgirls in Nigeria by the Boko Haram terrorist group has once again brought the growing threat of Islamic extremism in North Africa into the global spotlight. The incident, which is the largest and most violent example of Boko Haram's growing strength, is a stark reminder of the fanaticism of Islamic militants operating along the Saharan and sub-Saharan Africa border.\n\nThe Boko Haram terrorists have developed paramilitary capabilities and their operations are not just limited to Nigeria's Muslim north but are expanding throughout the country. The current hostage-taking is a testament to their growing strength, though it is far from the first such incident.\n\nNigeria, with a population of approximately 174 million, is sub-Saharan Africa's most important country, making the growing terrorist threat a matter of pressing interest for the United States. The United States, with a population of about 331 million, has paid scant attention to the North African terrorist threat, despite the country's size and its one-fifth share of Africa's total population.\n\nIn January 2013, terrorists affiliated with Al Qaeda attacked a natural gas production facility near the town of In Amenas in Algeria, holding over 800 people hostage. The terrorists executed some 40 foreigners before Algerian authorities re-established control, killing nearly 30 terrorists as the rest escaped. The incident occurred during President Obama's second inauguration, resulting in minimal American press coverage.\n\nShortly thereafter, in Mali, terrorists, many formerly employed by Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, nearly took over the entire country. Only repeated military interventions by France in its former colony prevented an Islamist victory. The situation in Mali remains far from secure even today.\n\nThe ongoing terrorist threat in Libya, which led to the assassination of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans on Sept. 11, 2012, has yet to be addressed effectively. For those seeking to understand the significance of the Benghazi attack, the lengthening list of terrorist attacks across North Africa, embodied in the current Boko Haram hostage-taking in Nigeria, provides a more than sufficient answer.\n\nThe United States needs an effective counterterrorism strategy in North Africa, and it currently lacks one. Despite having created a separate African Command at the Pentagon, separating it from the European Command, inadequate attention has been given to the North African terrorist threat. This lack of focus is not surprising, as the Obama administration has, for five years, insisted that the global war on terrorism was essentially over and won.\n\nThe Nigerian government has not dealt effectively with Boko Haram, and other governments in the region also face severe constraints on their operational capabilities. However, Nigeria's failure has enormous political implications throughout northern Africa. If Boko Haram's reach and strength continue to grow, it is not impossible that Nigeria's ethnically and religiously diverse population could face massive internal strife, and perhaps even split apart. The 1967 Biafra secession and subsequent civil war and humanitarian tragedy should remind us just how fragile Nigeria actually is.\n\nIf there is instability in Nigeria, and the Nigerian national government loses control over northern Nigeria because of it, it could become a haven for terrorist groups operating worldwide. Northern Africa is much closer to the West than the Al Qaeda and Taliban bases in the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nThe Obama administration's initial decision to offer assistance from the FBI, while laudable, nonetheless betrays its continuing - and very misguided - belief that global terrorism can be handled as a law-enforcement matter rather than the war it truly is. Much more is needed, and not just piecemeal assistance, even from America's military and intelligence agencies.\n\nNeither the Obama administration nor our country as a whole is paying adequate attention. The threat of Islamic terrorism on display now in northern Nigeria is global in scope and continues to grow, political rhetoric by the president notwithstanding. Boko Haram's latest outrage should focus our attention on the continuing threat of Al Qaeda and radical Islam. Whether we pay attention remains to be seen.",
    " Title: Young Voters' Turnout in Question as Midterms Approach: PRRI Survey\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2018 midterm elections draw near, a new survey by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic has raised concerns about the turnout of young voters, a demographic crucial for the Democratic party. The survey, released on Thursday, found that only one in three young Americans (ages 18-29) are \"absolutely certain\" they will vote in November, in stark contrast to the expected turnout for other age groups, particularly seniors (Americans age 65+), of whom 81 percent said they will vote in the midterms.\n\nThe survey, which polled 1,811 Americans over the age of 18 from Aug. 24 to Sept. 13, found that just 35 percent of young Americans are \"absolutely certain\" they will vote in November. This is significantly lower than the turnout in the 2014 midterms, where about 36 percent of Americans eligible to vote did so, according to the United States Election Project.\n\nPRRI CEO Robert P. Jones stated that young voters are an important demographic for Democrats, as they support Democratic candidates over Republican candidates by a margin of 61 percent to 35 percent. However, the low turnout of young voters could potentially hinder the Democrats' hopes for a \"blue wave\" in the 2018 midterms.\n\nRobert Griffin, associate director of research at PRRI, suggested that young Americans' low turnout could be due to feelings of uninformedness and a lack of belief in the efficacy of voting. \"We have norms in society not just about being a voter, but being an informed voter,\" Griffin said. \"If you have a portion of the society that judges itself uninformed, that will potentially have an effect on their likelihood of voting.\"\n\nGriffin also noted that young Americans do not believe voting can cause change as much as seniors do. While 78 percent of seniors polled for the survey said voting regularly is the \"most effective way to create change,\" only 50 percent of young Americans agreed.\n\nDespite the low turnout predicted for young voters, Griffin said it does not necessarily spell disaster for the Democrats, citing special elections since 2016 that have \"indicated large swings to the left.\" He added that young voter turnout for November looks to be consistent with 2014, \"one of the lowest turnout years for young voters probably in the last three decades.\"\n\nThe survey was conducted over the phone and online, with participants randomly selected. However, PRRI/The Atlantic over-sampled voters aged 18-29 to get more participants from that age group. The survey had a margin of error of 3 percent.",
    " Title: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan Renews Push for Obamacare Repeal, Aims to Balance Budget in a Decade\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a renewed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has declared his intention to balance the federal budget within a decade by including the repeal of President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement in the upcoming House GOP budget.\n\nRyan's announcement comes amidst heightened partisanship and the president's attempts to mend relationships with Republicans. The move is seen as a strategic one, as Ryan is expected to release the budget this week.\n\nRyan's persistence in repealing Obamacare, a position he has maintained in previous budget proposals and during the 2012 campaign trail, is not unexpected, according to political experts. They suggest that Ryan is catering to the most conservative members of the Republican base, particularly if he decides to run for president in 2016.\n\nJohn Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University, explains, \"I don't think it's necessarily a surprise. It's where he stood before the election, and it's a bargaining position. Also, it's a classic position to take if in 2016 if he wants to run for president. He knows it's not very realistic to try to repeal Obamacare, but it's a good way to try and get the nomination in 2016.\"\n\nNathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, adds, \"He's trying to appeal to several audiences. There's trying to get something done, but there's also appealing to the party's base.\"\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, D-Washington, is also expected to soon unveil a budget that will likely include increased taxes for wealthy Americans and businesses, as well as cuts to spending to address the deficit. Some in the Republican base support the idea that nixing costs associated with Obamacare would help trim the deficit.\n\nLast year, the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation wrote that one such effort to repeal Obamacare \"would reduce direct spending by $890 billion and reduce revenues by $1 trillion between 2013 and 2022, thus adding $109 billion to federal budget deficits over that period.\"\n\nWhile the chances of repealing Obamacare may be slim, as evidenced by the more than 30 unsuccessful attempts in the past, Ryan's stance on the issue remains firm. His budget proposal is expected to provide further insight into his strategy for balancing the budget and addressing the Affordable Care Act.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the New York Times: Liberty University's Response to COVID-19\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to the New York Times article published on March 29th titled \"Liberty University Brings Back Its Students, and Coronavirus Fears,\" it appears that the article may have overstated the situation regarding Liberty University's reopening and the subsequent spread of COVID-19 among students.\n\nThe article suggested that Liberty University's president, Jerry Falwell Jr., had put students at risk by reopening the university, and that a dozen students had contracted the disease. However, a closer look at the facts reveals a different story.\n\nA friend who works at the Fakirk Center at Liberty University reached out to a journalist privately and shared facts that contradicted the article's claims. The friend reported that the university did not undergo a broad reopening, but rather a small, targeted reopening focused on foreign students who had no other place to go. Additionally, more than one friend with children at Liberty reported that the university was largely deserted, \"like a ghost town.\"\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Eppes, who was quoted in the article, came forward to deny the accuracy of the quote attributed to him. The article also claimed that there were ominous warnings about a COVID breakout on campus, but no such breakout occurred. The University said there were no confirmed positive cases, and no one in the national press could confirm a single case of the disease contracted on campus from this reopening.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal columnist William McGurn wrote an article titled \"The Education of Jerry Falwell Jr.: Attacked for keeping Liberty University open, he now seems to have made a good call.\" McGurn reported that no Liberty student living on campus tested positive, and no staffer stationed on campus tested positive. The university followed all rules and took additional steps to ensure safety, including constant cleaning, social distancing, and quarantining those suspected of carrying the virus.\n\nIn conclusion, it appears that the New York Times article may have overstated the situation regarding Liberty University's response to COVID-19. The article's claims of a dozen students contracting the disease and a broad reopening of the university were contradicted by facts shared by a Liberty employee and by friends with children at the university. The article also failed to provide specific details about the symptoms exhibited by the students, making it difficult to determine if they truly had COVID-like symptoms. The Wall Street Journal's William McGurn reported that no Liberty student living on campus tested positive, and no staffer stationed on campus tested positive. The University followed all rules and took additional steps to ensure safety.",
    " Title: Trump Threatens to Block Financial Aid for USPS Unless Package Rates Raised for Retail Giants like Amazon\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Trump on Friday threatened to withhold financial aid for the United States Postal Service (USPS) unless it increases package shipping prices for retail giants such as Amazon.\n\nDuring a meeting in the Oval Office, Trump stated, \"The postal service is a joke. They should raise the price of a package by approximately four times.\"\n\nContrary to the USPS's request for direct aid, the CARES Act Trump signed into law last month included a provision allowing the cash-strapped USPS to borrow up to $10 billion from the Treasury Department to cover losses during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated on Friday that the lending plan is tied to \"postal reform.\" However, Trump offered more specific conditions: He only wants to free up the money if the Postal Service raises rates.\n\nTrump reiterated his long-held belief that Amazon and other large shipping retailers are receiving unfairly low rates from USPS for package delivery. \"For some reason, they're very cozy with some of these companies,\" Trump said.\n\n\"If they don't raise the price, I'm not signing anything,\" he added.\n\nLater on Friday afternoon, the president took to Twitter to praise postal service employees while criticizing the leadership of the USPS.\n\n\"I will never let our Post Office fail,\" the president tweeted. \"It has been mismanaged for years, especially since the advent of the internet and modern-day technology. The people that work there are great, and we\u2019re going to keep them happy, healthy, and well!\"\n\nTrump's sharp criticism of the post office came after he signed a $484 billion bipartisan coronavirus relief bill aimed primarily at small businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accused the Trump administration of attempting to use the loan to privatize the USPS. She urged Americans to support their mail carriers, who are crucial for delivering medicine and communications to senior citizens, she said.\n\n\"Right now, I see a very big danger for our country in the form of the Trump administration's interest in privatizing the post office,\" Pelosi said on Friday. \"This is really dangerous, and Mnuchin at Treasury is trying to leverage the debt situation in a way that must be stopped.\"\n\nShe compared the high approval ratings of the USPS to former President Barack Obama's popularity among Democrats.\n\n\"And the only way it will be stopped is if the American people understand what a loss it is for them,\" Pelosi said.",
    " Title: US Expands Travel Ban to Include Six Additional Countries, Stirring Controversy and Criticism\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and criticism, US President Donald Trump has expanded his travel ban, often referred to as a Muslim ban, to target citizens from six additional countries. The announcement was made on Friday, with immigrant advocates and critics denouncing the policy as discriminatory.\n\nThe new restrictions, which come three years after Trump's initial executive order, will affect citizens from Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania. The Trump administration maintains that these countries fail to meet US security and information-sharing standards, necessitating the new restrictions.\n\nThe problems officials cited range from subpar passport technology to a failure to sufficiently exchange information on \"terrorism\" suspects and criminals. The restrictions on the six new countries will take effect on February 21.\n\nThe US will suspend the issuance of visas that can lead to permanent residency for nationals of Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, and Nigeria, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said on Friday. Non-immigrant visas, which include those for tourism, short-term business, medical purposes, education, and journalism, among other types of visas, will not be affected.\n\nDuring December, for example, about 650,760 non-immigrant visas were granted worldwide. Immigrant visas, which include those for spouses, certain family members, certain sponsored employment, and other purposes, will also be affected.\n\nThe Trump administration has stated that there are exceptions to the restrictions. The US government will also stop issuing \"diversity visas\" to nationals of Sudan and Tanzania, according to a presidential proclamation. These visas, which Trump has criticized in the past, are available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.\n\nThe State Department uses a computer drawing to select people from around the world for up to 55,000 diversity visas. Nigeria is already excluded from the lottery along with other countries that had more than 50,000 natives immigrate to the US in the previous five years.\n\nThe existing version of the ban includes the Muslim-majority nations of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. North Korea and Venezuela also face visa restrictions, but those measures affect relatively few travelers. The current ban suspends immigrant and non-immigrant visas to applicants from the affected countries, but it allows exceptions, including for students and those who have established \"significant contacts\" in the US. The Venezuelan ban mostly affects government officials and their family members.",
    " Title: President Obama Endorses Senate Democrats' Implementation of the \"Nuclear Option\" to Expedite Nominations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move on Thursday, President Obama voiced his support for Senate Democrats' decision to enact the so-called \"nuclear option,\" altering Senate rules to expedite the confirmation process for judicial and executive nominees.\n\nDuring a press briefing, the president stated, \"Enough is enough. I'm a former senator. So is my vice president. We both value any senator's duty to advise and consent. It's important we take that very seriously. But a few now refuse to treat that duty of advise and consent with the respect it deserves.... What's at stake here is not my ability to fulfill my constitutional duty. What's at stake is the ability of any president to fulfill his or her constitutional duty. Public service is not a game. It is a privilege.\"\n\nThe nuclear option, which changes Senate rules and eliminates the possibility of a filibuster for presidential nominees, clears the way for the White House to propose a multitude of prospective officials who, thus far, have been blocked by Republicans. The Senate voted 52-48 earlier Thursday in favor of this controversial change, with GOP leaders vehemently objecting and casting the step as a power grab by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat.\n\nIt is important to note that the nuclear option does not extend to Supreme Court nominees. However, Republicans have already pledged to utilize the new rules to push through their own high-court picks when a Republican occupies the White House in the future.\n\nThe Senate rules fight serves as a diversion from the ongoing controversy surrounding the botched rollout of Obamacare, which has dominated Washington for the past month. President Obama, who, as a senator, opposed the idea of the nuclear option, said Thursday's move will help the government function more effectively and should alleviate some of the gridlock that has plagued Washington in recent years.\n\n\"We can't let it become normal,\" Mr. Obama said of the tactic of blocking his nominees through filibuster. \"So I support the step a majority of senators today took to change the way that Washington is doing business. More specifically, the way the Senate does business.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Criticism Mounts Over Trump-Putin Meeting as Lawmakers Call for Legislation and Increased Oversight\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Following a contentious news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump faced a wave of criticism from lawmakers across the political spectrum on Tuesday. The meeting, which took place during Trump's week-long trip to Europe, has been met with disapproval due to the president's apparent willingness to believe Putin's denials over U.S. intelligence reports that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, Trump defended the Putin meeting, stating that he had a great meeting with the Russian leader and blamed the media for the negative reception. \"While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia,\" Trump tweeted. \"Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!\"\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, was one of the critics who showed no signs of backing down. A day after saying that Putin probably celebrated the Trump meeting with caviar, Corker called for legislation to counter some of the president's foreign policy moves, including tariffs on imports.\n\n\"As the president taxes Americans with tariffs, he pushes away our allies and further strengthens Putin,\" Corker tweeted. \"It is time for Congress to step up and take back our authorities.\"\n\nDuring the morning tweet session, Trump also defended the Putin news conference by citing the thoughts of a rare supporter, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. \"Thank you @RandPaul, you really get it!\" Trump tweeted, citing a comment by the Kentucky senator that \"the President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what\u2019s he supposed think?\"\n\nWhile taking Putin's side, Trump also condemned the ongoing investigation of Russia as a \"disaster\" driving a wedge between the United States and Russia.\n\nIn another Tuesday tweet, Trump defended his performance at last week's NATO summit in Brussels, claiming that allies are spending more money on defense at his behest\u2014and throwing in criticism of the media and Russia while he was at it.\n\n\"NATO countries 'will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future, only because of me,' Trump tweeted. \"NATO was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for Russia). The media only says I was rude to leaders, never mentions the money!\"\n\nMembers of NATO said they were already increasing defense spending, irrespective of Trump. They also questioned Trump's commitment to the alliance, and said his critical comments about both NATO and the EU were pleasing to Putin and the Russians.\n\nAnother Republican who backed Trump after his Putin summit was Vice President Mike Pence. \"Disagreements between our countries were discussed at length,\" Pence told employees at the Commerce Department on Monday. \"But what the world saw, what the American people saw, is that President Donald Trump will always put the prosperity and security of America first.\"\n\nTrump has meetings at the White House on Tuesday, but so far is not scheduled to speak publicly. One of Trump's meetings is with a group of congressional lawmakers, though the subject is tax cuts rather than Russia.\n\nStill, several Republicans invited to the White House meeting had, only hours earlier, rebuked Trump over his appearance with Putin. Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), an Illinois Republican who represents the western suburbs of Chicago, said Russian interference in 2016 was \"undeniable\" and that the president had a \"responsibility\" to confront Putin.\n\nThe \"press conference,\" Roskam said in a statement Monday, \"was an affront to American democracy and the Intelligence Community and a victory for Russian propaganda.\"\n\nRep. Mike Bishop (R-Mich.), another White House invitee, said he stood by the assessment of congressional intelligence committees demonstrating Russia's effort to undermine the election.\n\n\"Open diplomatic communication between nuclear superpowers is essential,\" Bishop said in a statement. \"But lest anyone think otherwise, Vladimir Putin's Russia is not a friend to the United States.\"\n\nOthers were more cautious in their reaction. Republican Rep. Jim Renacci (R-Ohio), who represents a central Ohio district, posted on Twitter that \"it appears Russia was involved either directly or indirectly\" in the election but that he didn't \"believe their involvement affected the outcome.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats, meanwhile, continued to condemn Trump over his relationship with Putin. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Trump \"engaged in a dangerous, disgraceful and damaging show of his Blame America First policy.\" She called on congressional Republicans to step up efforts to block Russian interference in 2018 congressional races and Trump's likely re-election bid in 2020.\n\nSome Democrats said Trump's comments amount to an impeachable offense, or even treason. John Brennan, the CIA director under President Barack Obama, called Trump's performance \"nothing short of treasonous,\" and said that \"he is wholly in the pocket of Putin.\"\n\nResponding in an interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News, Trump described Brennan as \"a very bad person.\"",
    " Title: Republican Leaders Boycott ObamaCare's Medicare Cost-Controlling Committee, Sparking Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that challenges a contentious aspect of the Affordable Care Act, the Republican leaders of the House and Senate announced on Thursday their decision to boycott the Individual Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a committee created to control Medicare costs.\n\nThe IPAB, often criticized as a \"death panel\" by its most vocal opponents, has been a subject of controversy due to concerns that it would negatively impact seniors by compelling doctors to stop accepting Medicare patients. In a letter to President Obama, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell reaffirmed their stance that the panel should be abolished entirely.\n\nThe letter expressed concerns that the reduced payments enforced by the IPAB would lead to access issues, long waiting lists, and denied care for seniors. The 15-member advisory board, also known as IPAB, would have the power to enforce payment cuts on insurers, drug companies, and other service providers if Medicare costs exceed certain levels.\n\nThe health care law explicitly prohibits the board from rationing care, shifting costs to seniors, or reducing their benefits. However, Boehner, during a press conference on Thursday, argued that the members still \"have the authority to deny seniors access to care.\"\n\nThe impact of the boycott on the panel remains uncertain. The law stipulates that the president should consult with Congress on nominations, but the president is free to make appointments. The members of the board are supposed to be from both parties, and nominees would be subject to Senate confirmation.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney criticized the Republican stance and their renewed efforts to repeal the health care law. \"It just demonstrates again how out of touch with what the American people want the House Republicans have become,\" Carney said. \"Instead of focusing on measures that could help us invest in innovation and manufacturing and job creation, instead of focusing on common-sense efforts to reduce our deficit in a balanced way, House Republicans are voting again to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nWhen asked about the repeated votes to repeal the law, Boehner responded that there were about 70 new members of the House this year. \"Frankly, they have been asking for an opportunity to vote on it, and we are going to give it to them,\" Boehner said. He expressed support for total repeal of the law rather than amendments as it is implemented over the next year.\n\nRepublicans claim that there have only been two previous votes to eliminate the health care law in its entirety. They also assert that there have been more than 30 votes to partially repeal or defund the law, with several resulting in signed legislation, including one eliminating an unpopular tax-filing requirement that would have affected millions of businesses.\n\nEconomists have predicted that the Medicare board's services might not be needed in the near future due to manageable Medicare cost increases.",
    " Title: U.S. Strategy Against ISIS Faces Challenges as Coalition Partners Pursue Different Interests\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama met with military leaders from 21 allied countries this week to discuss the ongoing campaign against the Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria. The coalition, assembled by the U.S., has been successful in driving ISIS away from certain areas, but concerns have been raised about the shared interests and objectives among the coalition members.\n\nIn a speech last month, President Obama outlined his strategy for degrading and defeating ISIS. Since then, the U.S. and its allies have reported some successes, such as driving ISIS away from the Mosul Dam in Iraq. However, the president has expressed concern about the besieged Syrian town of Kobani and parts of Iraq's Anbar province, where ISIS has been tightening its grip.\n\nCritics, including Republican Senator John McCain, have challenged the president's strategy, arguing that ISIS is gaining ground in both Syria and Iraq. McCain, speaking on CNN, dismissed the U.S.-led airstrikes as mere pinpricks that have not stopped the militants. Military analyst Anthony Cordesman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies agrees, stating that the air war has fallen short of what was done in Kosovo or Kuwait.\n\nThe U.S. strategy relies on local ground forces to beat back ISIS, but cooperation from these forces has been slow to materialize. The U.S. and Turkey, for example, have yet to agree on which enemy in Syria is a bigger threat - ISIS or the regime of Bashar al-Assad. In Iraq, Sunni Muslims have yet to join forces with Shiites in battling the militants, despite the formation of a more inclusive Iraqi government.\n\nMichael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution warns that ISIS will likely expand its control by a few percent in both countries, but it is unlikely to make huge new inroads. O'Hanlon suggests a limited presence of U.S. Special Forces and military spotters could be helpful, but President Obama has been adamant that he will not order American ground forces into battle.\n\nObama has emphasized that the campaign to defeat ISIS cannot be waged solely on military terms. The U.S. and its allies must offer political and economic alternatives to the militants, he says. The U.S.-led military effort is being hampered by some of the same sectarian and political divisions that helped give rise to ISIS.\n\nThe U.S. strategy against ISIS faces challenges as coalition partners pursue different interests, and the campaign is likely to be a long-term effort.

    " Title: White House Remains Tied to Flynn Amidst Ongoing Controversy and Staffing Shifts\n\nArticle:\n\nThe influence of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn continues to linger in the White House, 84 days after his dismissal in February. President Donald Trump's continued praise for Flynn and his defense of the former advisor, despite the ongoing investigation into Russian ties, has maintained a connection between the two.\n\nSince Flynn's dismissal, staffers initially hired by Flynn, including his deputy K.T. McFarland, remain on the National Security Council and in other positions. Senior administration officials, including Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, have reportedly worked to undermine Flynn's successor, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster.\n\nFlynn, a three-star general who was dismissed from his post as Defense Intelligence Agency chief under President Barack Obama in 2014, backed Trump early in the campaign and developed a close relationship with the candidate and his senior aides. His loyalty to Trump has been evident, with the president refusing to disavow Flynn, drawing the administration further into the controversy that began with allegations of inappropriate contacts between Trump campaign aides and Russian government officials.\n\nThe relationship between Flynn and the president contrasts sharply with that of his successor, McMaster, who has clashed with the president since joining the administration. Trump has reportedly pushed back against McMaster's attempt to replace McFarland, who is set to become ambassador to Singapore.\n\nStaffing changes have been made in the wake of Flynn's departure, with McMaster reshaping the organization and removing Bannon from the NSC's Principals Committee and eliminating a handful of positions created by Flynn. Executive officer John Reed, a Flynn hire, was reassigned to the Coast Guard last week, and Adam Lovinger, a national security official dispatched to the NSC from the Pentagon at Flynn's request, had his security clearance revoked by Secretary of Defense James Mattis' chief of staff.\n\nLovinger had reportedly clashed with his boss at the Pentagon over the focus of the office, urging more attention to the threat of Iran and Islamic extremism, two issues on which Flynn was outspoken and controversial. The Pentagon declined to comment on Lovinger's status.\n\nThe president overrode McMaster's decision to reassign the NSC's senior director for intelligence, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, after Bannon and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, made the case that he should remain in his post.\n\nThe ongoing ties between the White House and Flynn, as well as the staffing changes and clashes within the administration, continue to be a topic of interest and speculation.",
    " Title: Reflections on Martin Luther King Jr.'s Legacy: A Personal Account from a Former White House Aide\n\nArticle:\n\nFifty years after the tragic assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., his impact on the nation and the world continues to resonate. For one former White House aide, King's life and work left an indelible mark, shaping his understanding of equality, empathy, and the power of nonviolent resistance.\n\nAs a young, impoverished white boy growing up in public housing, the 8-year-old's first encounter with King was through a black and white television screen. The young civil rights leader, who had just become the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize, captivated the boy with his empathy, kindness, and eloquence.\n\nThe former aide recalls how King's fight against discrimination and for the oppressed resonated with him, especially as a child who had experienced eviction from multiple homes. King's words, particularly from his \"I Have a Dream\" speech, taught him that all individuals, regardless of gender, color, faith, or sexual orientation, are born with the same rights.\n\nThe aide emphasizes that King's courage and unwavering commitment to his cause, despite facing daily threats, serve as a model for leadership. Even in the current political climate, marked by division and anger, the aide believes that King's wisdom, words, and compassion are needed more than ever.\n\nHaving worked in the White House for two presidents, on several presidential campaigns, and around politics for over 20 years, the former aide acknowledges the deep divisions and raw emotions that characterize the nation today.

    " Title: Ethiopia Faces Worst Drought in Decades, Leaving Millions in Need of Food and Water\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the small town of Fentale, Ethiopia, Genet Tamisat, a 27-year-old mother of two, sits in the scorching sun, cradling her 2-month-old baby. She is one of hundreds of mothers waiting for their children to be checked for malnutrition as Ethiopia faces its worst drought in decades.\n\n\"I have nothing to eat at home. I can't even buy maize by myself,\" said Tamisat, who also has a 4-year-old son. \"People can look at us and think we're OK, but we are in great danger. We have nothing.\"\n\nThe crisis confronting Tamisat and millions of other Ethiopians lacking food and drinking water is not receiving the attention it deserves, as the world is preoccupied with other urgent needs such as the wars in Syria and Yemen, and the migrant crisis.\n\nThe Ethiopian government and the United Nations are trying to raise $1.4 billion to feed 10.2 million Ethiopians, but only half of the required funds have been raised so far. Chege Ngugi, national director of the charity ChildFund Ethiopia, expressed concern, stating, \"My priority is to support the efforts of the government of Ethiopia to save lives, but we're not reaching everybody.\"\n\nA strong El Ni\u00f1o has blocked two consecutive rainy seasons that normally nourish crops that feed 85% of the country. The drought has forced the government to find additional food aid from the United States and other donors.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development dispatched a response team to Ethiopia to provide emergency assistance that includes nearly $4 million in corn and wheat seeds for more than 200,000 families.\n\nIn the Oromia region, which includes central Ethiopia, the land is arid as far as the eye can see. Animal carcasses\u2014some fresh, some old\u2014are scattered across patches of dusty earth.\n\nHumanitarian needs in this Horn of Africa country have tripled since the start of 2015 as the situation deteriorates. Malnutrition rates in the worst-affected areas have surpassed 20%, higher than the World Health Organization's emergency threshold of 15%.\n\nThis year, the food program will help more than 2 million children, pregnant women, and breast-feeding mothers suffering from moderate acute malnutrition. The U.N.'s children's fund, UNICEF, estimates that almost 500,000 children need treatment for severe acute malnutrition.\n\nEyoel Lemma, who works at ChildFund Ethiopia in Fentale, said, \"Even with interventions, the situation is getting worse.\" He added that ChildFund, with help from the U.N., also provides supplementary food and malnutrition treatment to children under age 5. However, this becomes a major difficulty as families migrate to different areas looking for water and pasture for their livestock, as well as to find jobs.\n\nOne woman on the move is Haso Bultum, 27. After hours of walking in the sun across barren mountains, she reached a rural health care facility here in Fentale with her malnourished 9-month-old twins. \"It's very hard. I've had no sleep, because we're trying to find some food for our cattle,\" she said. \"To save ourselves, we're constantly moving.\"\n\nWhile Ethiopia has the fastest-growing economy in the world and has lifted millions of citizens out of poverty, the reality is that 80% of Ethiopians are still dependent on agriculture. Challiss McDonough from the World Food Programme warned that her organization could run out of food within two months.\n\n\"We have been calling for urgent funding for months now, and still have only about a quarter of the resources that we need for the next six months. Unless we receive significant new funding very soon, we could start running out of food for relief assistance by May,\" McDonough said.\n\nSamuel Ferfu, manager of the Children's and Family Charitable Organization in Fentale, said another major issue is the lack of access to water. Almost 6 million people need emergency water, according to UNICEF.\n\n\"There's no water at all\u2014the river is dry,\" he said. \"No water makes sanitation impossible, and as a result, the prevalence of disease will increase.\"\n\nFor the time being, Ethiopians are praying that rain will reach the worst-affected areas, but flooding is a serious risk after a lengthy drought.\n\n\"Soon the rain will come, and people's worries will be flooding. But they have nothing except their homes to lose. They've already lost all their animals and crops,\" said Lemma from ChildFund Ethiopia.\n\nFor Tamisat, 27, and her young children, talk of rain in the coming months is a false hope.\n\n\"We have no water and no food,\" she said, wiping sweat off her forehead. \"I don't know what is coming for the future, but I have no hope about the rain.\"",
    " Title: Denver City Council Reverses Decision on Marijuana Smoking Ban on Private Property\n\nArticle:\n\nDenver officials have rescinded a contentious proposal that would have prohibited smoking marijuana on private property if it was visible from public areas. The Denver City Council on Monday rejected an ordinance that would have outlawed marijuana use on front porches, in front yards, or any private property visible from a public street, highway, or sidewalk, according to The Denver Post.\n\nThe city council is expected to take its final vote next week on a revised measure that permits individuals to smoke marijuana on their properties or with the property owner's permission. Prior to Monday's vote, Councilwoman Jeanne Robb had introduced an amendment that would have prohibited marijuana consumption \"in any outdoor location on private residential property\" where it was \"clearly observable from a public street, highway, or sidewalk.\"\n\nGoing into Monday's vote, at least six of the 13 city council members were leaning toward the rule. Another, Councilman Charlie Brown, was considered a swing vote. However, the Council voted 7-6 Monday in favor of an amendment reversing Robb's language banning marijuana use on private property.\n\nColorado, along with Washington state, legalized the possession of up to one ounce of recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older in 2012, despite it remaining illegal under federal law. Advocates of a public ban, such as Robb, argue that visible marijuana use sends the wrong message to children and teens and creates a negative image for the city.\n\n\"We are being looked at nationally,\" Robb told FoxNews.com. \"It's really a balance of the rights of those who consume marijuana and the localities where they live. The message is clear: do not be blatant. Be discreet. Not in our streets, not in our sidewalks.\"\n\nOpponents, like Mason Tvert, communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project, counter that the proposed ban infringes on the rights of Colorado residents to consume cannabis.\n\n\"Questions on where adults should use marijuana is a valid question,\" Tvert told FoxNews.com. \"There are likely proposals that may or may not make sense. The one in Denver does not. Currently, it is entirely legal for adults to consume alcohol and cigarettes in public. It is irrational to make it illegal for marijuana smokers not to be able to do the same.\"\n\nWhile it may be legal to consume alcohol on a porch or in the outdoor area of a bar, there are numerous laws across the country banning public drunkenness. And in most cities, it is illegal to carry an open container of alcohol outside one's own property. Cigarette smokers, however, rarely encounter such regulations.\n\nDenver Police Chief Robert White has stated that if the front porch rule is passed, it will be among the city's lowest priorities, and he doesn't expect many \u2013 if any \u2013 citations will ever be written.\n\nAs Colorado prepares for the rollout of marijuana sales, Washington state is gearing up as well, with the liquor control board finalizing its ruling on the marijuana industry in October, setting the stage for pot sales to start by 2014. So far, there have been no local efforts to halt production, sales, or use in that state, but many in the area are likely to study the lessons and tactics used in the Denver fight.\n\nOfficials in Chicago are also taking steps to create strict regulations about where pot can be grown and dispensed. The city's Department of Planning and Development has been working on legislation in anticipation of a state law taking effect that would make Illinois the 20th state in the country to allow medical marijuana use. The Chicago measure must still be voted on and approved by the Chicago City Council. If approved, it would allow 22 centers where cannabis can be grown in the city, with the same measure prohibiting them from opening within 2,500 feet of any school, day care center, or residential area.",
    " Title: Conservative Media Faces Identity Crisis: CPAC Panel Discusses Future of Right-Wing Journalism\n\nArticle:\n\nThe conservative media is grappling with an identity crisis, as leading figures in the right-wing media sphere question the aggressive and factually loose nature of their journalism. This issue has gained national attention following last year's election and the failed attempts to discredit figures such as Chuck Hagel, now President Obama's Secretary of Defense.\n\nThe debate will be addressed at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where representatives from prominent conservative news outlets, including Fox News, Townhall, and The Daily Caller, will gather on Friday. The panel, titled \"Survivor: Conservative Journalism,\" is a side event in the larger CPAC calendar, but it addresses one of the most pressing issues facing the Republican Party: the need for conservative media outlets to gain more recognition and credibility among mainstream media.\n\nKeith Urbahn, a former chief of staff to Donald Rumsfeld and one of Friday's panelists, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that \"the conservative movement now has its own media outlets, which is a terrific thing. But with that comes a basic responsibility to report facts and admit error \u2013 something we slam the mainstream media for all the time. We don't always live up to those standards.\"\n\nIn late February, influential Red State blogger Erick Erickson argued that conservative journalists had \"forgotten the basics of reporting\" because they were \"trying so hard to highlight controversies, no matter how trivial.\" At The New Yorker, editor Alex Koppelman likewise argued that right-wing journalists would have to take the \"commitment to journalism more seriously\" if they wanted \"to be taken more seriously.\"\n\nThese columns were written after the conservative website Breitbart.com published articles alleging that Hagel had received funding from a group called \"Friends of Hamas.\" The group turned out to be non-existent \u2013 a fact easily uncovered by a few minutes of basic reporting.\n\nErickson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that conservatives need to focus on building up \"good journalists committed to the basics.\" Katie Pavlich, the news editor of Townhall and one of Friday's panelists, likewise told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that \"moving forward, solid and documented investigative reporting will be key in gaining even more credibility throughout the industry.\"",
    " Title: Trump's Criticism of NFL and NBA Players Sparks Controversy and Backlash\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump found himself in the midst of a heated debate on Saturday after his comments regarding NFL and NBA players who choose to kneel during the national anthem sparked criticism from various professional athletes.\n\nAt a campaign rally in Alabama on Friday night, Trump criticized NFL free agent Colin Kaepernick, stating that players who kneel during the national anthem should be fired and fans should leave games.\n\n\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b---- off the field right now. He's fired,'\" Trump said.\n\nSeveral NFL players responded to Trump's comments on Twitter, while commissioner Roger Goodell issued a statement on Saturday condemning Trump's \"divisive\" rhetoric.\n\n\"The NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country and our culture,\" Goodell said. \"There is no better example than the amazing response from our clubs and players to the terrible natural disasters we've experienced over the last month.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump stirred conflict early Saturday by announcing via Twitter that NBA star Stephen Curry was no longer welcome at the White House after the Golden State Warriors point guard said he did not want to pay the president a visit, a tradition for championship teams.\n\n\"Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team,\" Trump tweeted. \"Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!\"\n\nNBA players also clapped back at Trump, with LeBron James, the vice president of the NBA Players Association, ripping the announcement.\n\nJames, whose Cleveland Cavaliers were defeated by Curry's Warriors earlier this year, called Trump a \"bum\" in a tweet while saying that visiting the White House was an honor \"until you showed up!\"\n\nCurry had told reporters on Friday that he did not want to go to the White House, and said in June he \"probably would not visit the White House due to Trump's stances on a variety of issues.\"\n\n\"By not going, hopefully it will inspire some change for what we tolerate in this country and what we stand for, what is accepted and what we turn a blind eye toward,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not just the act of not going. There are things you have to do on the back end to push that message into motion,\" he continued. \"You can talk about all the different personalities that have said things and done things from [Colin] Kaepernick to what happened with Michael Bennett to all sorts of examples of what has gone on in our country that has led to change. We're all trying to do what we can, using our platforms, our opportunities, to shed light on it. I don't think not going to the White House will miraculously make everything better. But this is my opportunity to voice that.\"\n\nA formal White House invitation has not been issued to the Warriors, however the NBA has been communicating with the White House about a visit, according to ESPN.\n\nTrump's feuding with the NFL and NBA athletes came as his party's latest efforts to make good on their promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare stumbled, with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) coming out against the plan on Friday.\n\nMcCain's opposition potentially dooms the bill sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) that GOP leaders hoped to vote on in the coming week.\n\nTrump swiped at McCain several times during the rally in Alabama on Friday night, where he was campaigning for Sen.

    " Title: \"New Survey Reveals Impact of Financial Crisis on American Families: Shift in Saving Habits, Debt, and Income Inequality\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA new survey by the Federal Reserve Board has shed light on the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on American families, revealing changes in saving habits, debt, and income inequality.\n\nThe survey, which covers the period from 2007 to 2010, paints a picture of a nation still recovering from the economic downturn. Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who served as an adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., commented, \"It fills in details to a picture that we already knew was quite ugly, and these details very much underscore that. It makes clear how devastating this has been for the middle class.\"\n\nOne of the key findings of the survey is the decline in savings. The share of families saving anything over the previous year fell to 52 percent in 2010 from 56.4 percent in 2007. This trend, coupled with the fact that total savings have increased since 2007, suggests that a smaller group of families is saving more money, while a growing number manage to save nothing.\n\nThe survey also found a shift in the reasons that families save. More families said they were saving money as a precautionary measure, to ensure they had enough liquidity to meet short-term needs. Fewer said they were saving for retirement, or for education, or for a down payment on a home.\n\nThe report also underscored the limited progress that households had made in reducing the amounts they owed to lenders. The share of households reporting any debt declined by 2.1 percentage points over the last three years, but 74.9 percent of households still owed something, and the median amount did not change.\n\nThe decline in reported incomes could have increased the weight of those debts, tying up a larger share of families' take-home pay. However, one of the rare benefits of the crisis, historically lower interest rates, has helped to offset that effect. Families have also been able to reduce debt payments by refinancing into mortgages with longer terms and deferring repayment of student loans and other obligations.\n\nThe survey also confirmed that Americans are shifting the kinds of debts they carry. The share of families with credit card debt declined by 6.7 percentage points to 39.4 percent, and the median balance fell 16.1 percent to $2,600. Conversely, the share of families with education-related debt rose to 19.2 percent in 2010 from 15.2 percent in 2007.\n\nThe cumulative statistics concealed large disparities in the impact of the crisis. Families with incomes in the middle 60 percent of the population lost a larger share of their wealth over the three-year period than the wealthiest and poorest families. One basic reason for this disproportion is that the wealth of the middle class is mostly in housing, and the median amount of home equity dropped to $75,000 in 2010 from $110,000 in 2007.\n\nThose middle-income families also lost a larger share of their income. The earnings of the median family in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution actually increased from 2007 to 2010, in part because of the expansion of government aid programs during the recession. Wealthier families, which derive more income from investments, were also cushioned against the recession.\n\nThe data does provide the latest indication, however, that the recession reduced income inequality in the United States, at least temporarily. The average income of the wealthiest families fell much more sharply than the median, indicating that some of those at the very top of the ladder slipped down at least a few rungs.\n\nRanking American families by income, the top 10 percent of households still earned an average of $349,000 in 2010. The average net worth of the same families was $2.9 million.",
    " Title: GOP Faces Reality of Tax Hike as Obama, Democrats and Republicans Negotiate\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Bush tax rates approach their expiration date and federal agencies face significant spending cuts, a reality for the Republican Party has emerged: Tax rates are set to increase, and the only question is by how much and for whom.\n\nFrom Capitol Hill to K Street, discussions among Republicans revolve around a small increase in marginal tax rates, which would be paired with raising the threshold for wealthy Americans facing tax increases from $250,000 to $500,000 or higher in annual income. However, any rate increase for Republicans, one that could garner support from rank-and-file lawmakers, would require substantial cuts to entitlement programs. Yet, there is no evidence that President Barack Obama and the Democrats have agreed to specific entitlement cuts in closed-door negotiations, particularly those that would be sufficient to offset a rate change and an increase in the threshold for the wealthy.\n\n\"Both sides have to hold hands and jump on this one,\" said a top Senate aide.\n\nIf House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) fail to reach an agreement with Obama, the highest marginal tax rate will increase from 35 percent to 39.6 percent on January 1, the same rate it was under former President Bill Clinton. Tax rates on estates will also rise, and nearly 30 million more Americans will be affected by the alternative minimum tax, originally designed to ensure wealthier individuals and families did not avoid federal taxes.\n\nThe proposed tax hikes in exchange for entitlement cuts trade-off faces numerous problems, according to GOP Hill aides, who emphasized that this proposal has not been formally offered yet.\n\nFirst, Democrats believe they are in a position of strength in these negotiations and are unlikely to give up concessions on entitlement programs without significant moves from Boehner.\n\n\"We are winning,\" said a top Hill Democratic staffer. \"We don't have to give up on anything yet.\"\n\nBoehner also faces pressure from his right and is concerned whether House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will support him. He has so far refused to agree to any increase in tax rates, even though many in his party are acknowledging such an outcome as unavoidable. The best Republicans can do, these lawmakers say, is limit the size of the increases while attempting to shift the political blame to the Democrats.\n\n\"The speaker is opposed to raising tax rates, because raising tax rates costs jobs,\" said Michael Steel, spokesman for Boehner.\n\nFurthermore, any suggestion of Republicans backing a tax increase faces opposition in the Senate.\n\n\"That doesn't really help solve the problem,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), ranking member of the powerful Finance Committee. \"I'm against raising tax rates. We know that if we raise those tax rates and we don't have corresponding reductions in spending, we'll get the tax rates and no spending reductions. That's just a game that the Democrats play over and over and over, and the American people let them get away with it sometimes.\"",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Incorporate Obamacare Individual Mandate Repeal in Tax Cut Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nSenate Republicans, in a move to secure more funding for tax cuts and address a long-standing political objective, have revised their tax cut bill to include the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate. This move, which has been met with criticism from Democrats and the health insurance industry, aims to generate additional revenue for further tax relief for individual Americans.\n\nThe individual mandate repeal is expected to save the government over $300 billion over the next decade, freeing people from the obligation to have health care coverage and the government from the responsibility of subsidizing much of that coverage. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this change would result in 13 million fewer people having coverage in 2027 without the pressure from the mandate.\n\nPresident Trump has been advocating for this move for weeks, eyeing the substantial savings that could be redirected towards more tax cuts for average Americans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, expressed optimism about the move, stating, \"We're optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful.\"\n\nDemocrats have criticized the move, with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, stating, \"Republicans just can\u2019t help themselves. They\u2019re so determined to provide tax giveaways to the rich that they\u2019re willing to raise premiums on millions of middle-class Americans and kick 13 million people off their health care.\"\n\nThe revised tax plan, as outlined by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch, includes a doubling of the child tax credit from the current $1,000 to $2,000, and some other adjustments to individual tax rates. The plan also eliminates a number of deductions, such as the one for state and local taxes paid, and uses the savings to pay for lowering the rates.\n\nThe plan also includes changes to benefit more \"pass-through\" companies, which file their taxes as individuals, by allowing them to claim a new 17.4 percent deduction. This provision is designed to give a boost to small businesses.\n\nThe tax plan, which costs about $1.415 trillion, is down from the $1.496 trillion plan rolled out last week. The plan amounts to a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years, with about 60 percent going to businesses and the rest going to individual taxpayers. The plan slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent and lowers the top individual rate from 39.6 percent to 38.5 percent while adjusting other individual tax brackets so they kick in at higher income thresholds.\n\nRepublican leaders are aiming to move their broader bill through committee this week, with possible floor action the week after Thanksgiving, as they look to get a final package to Mr. Trump\u2019s desk by the end of the year. The ambitious time frame reflects the party's view of the tax overhaul effort as the party's last real chance to give voters a reason to turn out in next year's midterm elections, after their monthslong effort to repeal Obamacare in its entirety stalled out over the summer.",
    " Title: Clinton's Testimony on Benghazi Attack: A Glimpse into the Democratic Mindset\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events last week, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared before two congressional panels to answer questions regarding the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The hearing, intended to uncover the truth behind the deadly incident, provided a chilling insight into the Democratic mindset and a potential glimpse at what the 2016 presidential race may hold.\n\nOn September 11, 2012, the consulate was attacked by heavily armed terrorists, who killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans despite the almost non-existent security. The attack, initially described as a spontaneous protest sparked by an offensive YouTube video, was later revealed to be a premeditated terrorist attack.\n\nDuring the Senate hearing, Clinton was asked about the administration's prolonged dissemination of false information regarding the attack's cause. In response, Clinton, visibly agitated, questioned the relevance of the information, stating, \"What difference, at this point, does it make?\"\n\nThis response, in essence, encapsulates the Democratic mindset, as the administration had buried the matter for months in an internal investigation, refusing to comment on the details of the attack. The story had changed drastically just hours before another congressional hearing months earlier, with State Department officials admitting that the attack was not spontaneous but a premeditated terrorist attack.\n\nClinton's response during the hearing indicated a lack of accountability, as she seemed to suggest that the motive behind the attack was less important than finding and bringing the perpetrators to justice. This response was met with criticism, as many felt that the motive behind the administration's initial response was crucial to understanding the events that transpired.\n\nThe Clinton administration's handling of the Benghazi attack, characterized by a lack of transparency and a dismissive attitude towards congressional inquiries, raises concerns about the potential tactics that may be employed during the 2016 presidential race. The Democratic mindset, as demonstrated by Clinton's response, appears to prioritize achieving political goals above all else, regardless of the truth or the consequences of their actions. This approach, if carried into the 2016 presidential race, could lead to a lack of accountability and a disregard for the truth, as the ends are seen as justifying the means.",
    " Title: Roger Ailes, Founder of Fox News, Dies at 77\n\nRoger Ailes, the media mogul who built Fox News into a cable powerhouse and a long-running No. 1 cable news network, passed away on Thursday at the age of 77. The Ohio-born television pioneer was a confidant of presidents and an acknowledged master of communications.\n\nAiles' wife, Elizabeth Ailes, confirmed the news in a statement. \"I am profoundly sad and heartbroken to report that my husband, Roger Ailes, passed away this morning,\" the statement read. \"Roger was a loving husband to me, to his son Zachary, and a loyal friend to many. He was also a patriot, profoundly grateful to live in a country that gave him so much opportunity to work hard, to rise\u2014and to give back.\"\n\nAccording to the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office, Ailes died of complications from a fall at his home on May 10.\n\nRupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox and Fox News Channel, expressed his sadness over the development. \"Everybody at Fox News is shocked and grieved by the death of Roger Ailes,\" Murdoch said. \"A brilliant broadcaster, Roger played a huge role in shaping America's media over the last 30 years. He will be remembered by the many people on both sides of the camera he discovered, nurtured, and promoted.\"\n\nSean Hannity, a host on Fox News, paid tribute to his onetime boss in a series of tweets. \"Today, America lost one of its great patriotic warriors,\" Hannity tweeted. \"He has dramatically and forever changed the political and the media landscape, single-handedly for the better.\"\n\nAiles left Fox News under a cloud of controversy on July 21, 2016, though he strongly denied the allegations. Ailes was born in Warren, Ohio, and attended Ohio University in Athens, where he majored in radio and television. After graduating in 1962, he launched his career in black and white-era television by working for then-local personality Mike Douglas. When the show was syndicated a few years later, Ailes' star rose with it.\n\nIt was during a 1967 taping of \"The Mike Douglas Show\" that Ailes met future president Richard Nixon, who later tapped him to serve as his executive producer for television. That experience began a decades-long dual track in which Ailes cast long shadows over both television and politics, culminating in his founding of Fox News.\n\nIn 1984, Ailes worked on President Reagan's re-election campaign. Four years later, he was a key player in the successful presidential campaign of George H.W. Bush, helping to plot effective messaging and television advertising strategies. He later helped build CNBC before Murdoch chose him to launch Fox News.\n\nAs recently as last fall's election, and after his career at Fox had ended, Ailes reportedly advised President Trump in preparation for debates. Ailes and Elizabeth were married in 1998. Their only son, Zachary, was born on New Year's Day 2000.",
    " Title: State Department Releases Previously Undisclosed Emails from Hillary Clinton's Tenure as Secretary of State\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the State Department has released 44 previously undisclosed emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's tenure, which were not included in the 30,000 private messages she handed over to the government last year. These emails reveal Clinton's interactions with lobbyists, political donors, Clinton Foundation donors, and business interests during her time as secretary of state.\n\nThe conservative legal group Judicial Watch obtained these emails as part of their lawsuit against the State Department. The emails cover Clinton's first three months in office in early 2009, a period for which Clinton did not turn over any emails to the State Department last year. The government discovered the newly disclosed messages during a search of agency computer files from longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin.\n\nOne of the emails shows Clinton exchanging messages with a senior Morgan Stanley investment executive whom she later met with at her office in Washington. These emails were among 246 pages of Abedin messages turned over to Judicial Watch.\n\nClinton's campaign officials have yet to respond to questions regarding these emails.\n\nThe emails are separate from a larger batch of several thousand work-related emails that FBI officials recovered from Clinton's private server. Clinton's legal team turned over more than 30,000 emails from her server to the State Department last March, but only after deleting another 30,000 messages that Clinton's team deemed private and personal. The FBI plans to turn over the reconstructed Clinton emails to the State Department for public release.\n\nThe new Clinton emails include a February 2009 message from Stephen Roach, then-chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, stating he planned to testify to Congress that week and was \"happy to help in any way I can.\" Roach later met with Clinton over the summer for 30 minutes, according to Clinton calendars obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nIn another email, Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, informed Clinton that National Security Agency and State Department officials discussed an attempt to develop a modified Blackberry for Clinton that might be used when she worked in a restricted State Department office that did not allow private phones. Clinton responded with \"good news,\" but she continued using a private Blackberry tied to her private server.",
    " Title: New Report Suggests John Podesta's Email Hack Resulted from Phishing Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final presidential debate on Wednesday, Donald Trump expressed skepticism regarding Russia's alleged involvement in the U.S. election hacking incidents, stating, \"Hillary Clinton has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.\" However, 17 intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia was behind the hacks, as Clinton pointed out.\n\nA new report by security firm SecureWorks, investigating the hackings, suggests that John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, unwittingly handed over his email password by falling for a common phishing attack set up by a Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bear. According to Motherboard, the group sent several emails to members of Clinton's inner-circle in March with a custom Bitly link leading to a fake Gmail login page. Podesta clicked on the link and entered his password, granting the hackers access to his account.\n\nFancy Bear, also known as APT28 and Sofacy, is also believed to be behind a similar attack on the Democratic National Convention (DNC) last summer. Thomas Rid, a King's College professor, wrote in Esquire that the group made a \"grave mistake\" by failing to set the Bitly links to private, allowing investigators to see whom else the group had targeted. Among the group's recent breaches were the German parliament, the Italian military, the Saudi foreign ministry, the emails of Philip Breedlove, Colin Powell, and John Podesta, as well as the DNC.\n\nIt is widely believed that the Russian government is sponsoring the attacks and disseminating the information to Clinton's opponents, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. A Clinton spokesman stated on Thursday, \"There is no longer any doubt that Putin is trying to help Donald Trump by weaponizing WikiLeaks.\"\n\nThe threat of Russian espionage has become a significant issue in the 2016 election, not just because it reveals critical weaknesses in America's cyber-security, but also because it highlights how Russia has sought to influence the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. John Podesta, for one, is not making matters easier. It is hoped that the next time the 67-year-old former chief of staff to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama receives an email with a suspicious link, he thinks twice before clicking.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Divide Among U.S. Governors on Trump's Plan to Reopen Economies Amidst Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the death toll from COVID-19 continues to rise, governors across the United States are grappling with the challenge of reopening their economies while ensuring the safety of their citizens. On Thursday, the White House released a three-phase plan that provides guidelines for when states might reopen, suggesting that new COVID-19 cases have declined for at least 14 days before states begin to loosen restrictions.\n\nThe plan, which emphasizes testing and contact tracing, has received mixed reactions from governors, with enthusiasm for the plan varying by party. Democratic governors generally expressed concern that it is too early to provide a timeline for reopening and have called for more testing support from the federal government. Republican governors, while urging caution, have been more optimistic about the possibility for a swift return to normalcy.\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, stated, \"We appreciate their suggestions, and we will evaluate them thoroughly, but the plain overriding fact is we cannot put the cart before the horse.\" She added, \"As CDC, FEMA, and public health experts across the country have made clear, we are not at a point currently where it would be safe to reopen, and doing so prematurely would undo the heroic work of our health workers and first responders, endanger many more people and essentially guarantee enhanced transmission of the virus, leading to more illness and death.\"\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, expressed similar sentiments, stating, \"We can not do it without federal help.\" Cuomo accused President Trump of \"passing the buck without passing the bucks.\" In response, Trump tweeted, \"Governor Cuomo should spend more time 'doing' and less time 'complaining.'\"\n\nWashington state recently extended its stay-at-home order to early May. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee told NPR's All Things Considered that two conditions would have to exist before the state could reopen its economy: \"No. 1, we have to drive down the number of infections so they're as close to zero as possible so that we're very confident that there will not be a resurgence that could overwhelm our hospitals,\" he said. \"The second condition is we have to have a comprehensive and robust testing and contact-tracing system.\"\n\nInslee stated that the state is far from being able to meet either of those conditions. The contact tracing system is dependent on being able to massively test the population to see who has been infected. \"That testing capability does not exist anywhere in the United States right now,\" Inslee said.\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, told NPR's Morning Edition that the federal guidelines resemble the plan the state adopted the day before. Polis expressed a wish for a national testing strategy, stating, \"Most other countries are doing it nationally.\" He added, \"I wish that we had more help from the federal government.\" When each state is responsible for testing, he said, the states end up competing against other states for supplies, which drives prices up.\n\nIn North Carolina, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper said he appreciated the White House's guidance, \"but we still need the federal government to help with testing and personal protective equipment.\" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown echoed other Democratic governors' calls for more federal assistance. \"We are still in dire need of critical resources from the federal government, including sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) and increased testing capacity,\" she said.\n\nIn contrast to Democrats, the response from Republican governors has been more enthusiastic. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee stated, \"I think the president and his team are headed in a very good direction.\" Lee said his state would use the same sort of gradual reopening strategy. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said her takeaway from Thursday's two-hour call between Trump and governors was that the federal government is a partner. \"They are standing alongside us,\" Reynolds said. \"If there's anything that we need to ramp it up and get our state's economy moving again, they stand ready and willing.\" Reynolds said she was hoping to reopen the state's economy sometime in May, if possible.\n\nNebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts and Idaho Gov. Brad Little also expressed support for the president's guidelines, with Ricketts stating, \"It is critical that we get people back to work safely and continue to slow the spread of the virus as the country opens up.\" Little said the president's criteria for phased opening \"matches the criteria we have been using in Idaho.\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced on Friday a series of executive orders that would start to reopen shuttered businesses, making Texas \"the first state to lay out a defined rollback of COVID-19 restrictions.\" Retail outlets in the state will be able to open on Friday, April 24, as long as they can deliver items to customers' cars or homes in order to minimize contact. Texas will also loosen restrictions on surgeries, permitting procedures that \"would not deplete the hospital capacity or the PPE needed to cope with COVID-19.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Accuses Media of Pushing 'Radical Left Democrat Views' in Series of Tweets\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, President Donald Trump criticized the media, particularly The Washington Post, as he continued his attacks on four progressive congresswomen. The president accused the media of pushing \"Radical Left Democrat views\" and labeled \"Fake News\" as \"the Enemy of the People.\"\n\nTrump's tweets came in response to a Washington Post story detailing the fallout of his incendiary tweets targeting Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.). The president took issue with a line in the story that stated advisers wrote out talking points and handed the president \"reams of opposition research on the four Congresswomen.\"\n\n\"Now really, does that sound like me?\" Trump tweeted. \"What advisors, there were no talking points, except for those stated by me, &'reams of paper' were never given to me.\"\n\nThe Washington Post photographer captured a photo of Trump at a White House event last week with sheets of paper containing bullet points of information about Omar and the other representatives.\n\nTrump's tweets followed his criticism of the Post story with broader condemnation of the press, accusing it of pushing \"Radical Left Democrat views.\" The president frequently describes coverage he deems unfavorable as \"fake news,\" and has regularly labeled certain media outlets the \"enemy of the people\" despite warnings from press advocates about the danger of the term.\n\nTrump has been preoccupied for days with the media coverage of his attacks on the four congresswomen, which began with tweets eight days ago saying the lawmakers should \"go back\" to their countries despite all four being U.S. citizens. Only Omar, who came to the U.S. as a Somali refugee, was born outside the U.S. Trump has escalated his attacks in the days since, claiming repeatedly that the lawmakers hate the country and defending supporters who chanted \"send her back\" about Omar as \"incredible patriots.\"",
    " Title: Giuliani Clarifies: No Pardons in Russia Investigation, but Possibility of Post-Investigation Cleansing\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump's lead attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on Sunday walked back earlier suggestions that targets in the ongoing investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election could be pardoned by the president.\n\n\"The president is not going to issue a pardon in this investigation,\" Giuliani said. \"I want that to come out loud and clear.\"\n\nHowever, Giuliani, in an appearance on CNN's State of the Union, left open the possibility that the president could take action when the Russia inquiry was concluded if he determined that people had been \"treated unfairly.\"\n\n\"You are not going to get a pardon just because you are involved in this investigation,\" the outspoken former New York mayor said, before quickly adding that those targets \"certainly won't be excluded.\"\n\nGiuliani raised the prospect that the president was considering pardons late last week, after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was jailed for violating terms of his bail in Washington. He is awaiting a September trial on money laundering and fraud charges. He also faces a July trial in Alexandria, Va., where he is charged with bank and tax fraud.\n\nA federal judge revoked Manafort's $10 million bond Friday after he was charged with obstruction for allegedly tampering with witnesses in the pending criminal cases against him.\n\nManafort is one of 20 people known to be charged in the yearlong Russia investigation. Five people, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and Trump campaign deputy Rick Gates have pleaded guilty.\n\n\"When the whole thing is over, things might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons,\" Giuliani told the New York Daily News. \"You put a guy in jail if he\u2019s trying to kill witnesses, not just talking to witnesses.\"\n\nGiuliani also renewed his attacks on the legitimacy of the Russia investigation headed by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nCiting findings in last week's Justice Department inspector general's report related to the conduct of two senior FBI agents, the former mayor called for a review of the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nThe inspector general, during an 18-month review of the handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, unearthed text messages exchanged by the agents in which they disparaged Trump. Both of the agents held top positions in both the FBI's Clinton and Trump investigations.\n\nIn one of the messages, FBI counter-intelligence official Peter Strzok suggested that he might take action to \"stop\" Trump's candidacy.\n\n\"We want the Mueller probe to be investigated,\" Giuliani said Sunday.\n\nLater Sunday, Giuliani said on CBS' Face the Nation that he would continue to push for such an internal review as a condition in the ongoing negotiations with Mueller who is seeking an interview with Trump in the Russia inquiry.\n\nAs part of that investigation, Mueller's team is reviewing whether Trump sought to obstruct the probe when he fired FBI Director James Comey last year.\n\n\"We are in rather sensitive negotiations,\" Giuliani said, adding that it was important to first learn whether Strzok had \"infected\" the Russia investigation before he was removed last year.\n\n\"I don't want to do it,\" Giuliani said, referring to a Mueller interview with Trump. \"The president wants to do it.\"\n\nThe former mayor said a decision on a possible interview would likely be made by July 4.",
    " Title: Democrats' Small-Donor Fundraising Surge Outpaces Republicans in Final Stretch of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the lead-up to the midterm elections, a significant shift in campaign financing has emerged, with Democrats boasting a substantial financial advantage over Republicans, erasing the latter's traditional edge in fundraising. This surge in funding, fueled by a grassroots movement of small donors, is particularly noticeable in unlikely districts and is often tied to opposition towards President Trump.\n\nIn Fresno, California, prosecutor Andrew Janz, a Democratic candidate, raised an impressive $4.1 million in the third quarter. His target is eight-term Republican Representative Devin Nunes, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee and a staunch ally of President Trump. Janz attributes his donor base to a widespread desire to unseat Nunes.\n\nSimilarly impressive fundraising figures have been announced by other Democratic challengers. Sharice Davids, in an eastern Kansas district, raised $2.7 million. Amy McGrath, in central Kentucky, raised $3.65 million. Elissa Slotkin, in southern Michigan, raised $2.6 million.\n\nCompiled spending numbers, obtained by NPR, offer some good news and some bad news for the Republicans. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC aligned with House Republicans, has spent $90 million on the general-election campaign, compared to $51 million by its Democratic counterpart, the House Majority PAC.\n\nHowever, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has outspent the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) by $64 million to $47 million. Furthermore, Democratic House candidates, thanks to the influx of small-donor contributions, have outspent Republican candidates by $109 million to $60 million.\n\nSteve Israel, former DCCC chair, comments on the Republican super PACs' inability to dominate races due to the \"massive grassroots fundraising energy behind Democrats this year.\"\n\nWhile fundraising success does not guarantee Democrats an easy path to victory, most of them are challenging incumbents, who, by definition, have won at least once on the same terrain. The race for some House Republicans, such as Reps. Rod Blum of Iowa, Mike Coffman of Colorado, and Mike Bishop of Michigan, may be virtually over, as the NRCC and CLF cancel ad buys and shift dollars to other contests with better prospects.\n\nTom Davis, a former Republican congressman who served as chairman of the NRCC for two election cycles, suggests that the script for the NRCC chair, as he delivers bad news to a colleague in the House Republican Conference, might read: \"We thought we'd be able to do a million dollars in TV, but now we have to put that somewhere else because frankly, you're just not performing, and we can't afford to waste it to make you feel good.\"",
    " Title: Fox News' Post-Ailes Era: A Balancing Act Between Change and Continuity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the sudden departure of Roger Ailes, the former co-founder and CEO of Fox News, the network has entered a new phase, marked by a blend of change and continuity. The swift removal of Ailes, who was accused of sexual harassment by numerous women, was followed by a series of personnel changes that have left some within the network questioning the extent of the cultural shift.\n\nFollowing Ailes' departure, Rupert Murdoch, the network's founder and executive chairman, took over as interim CEO. In the weeks that followed, several of Ailes' associates were either retired or dismissed, including former Fox News CFO Mark Kranz and some of Ailes' closest allies. However, the Murdochs' actions took an unexpected turn when they elevated Bill Shine, Ailes' closest deputy, and Jack Abernethy, a Fox Television Stations executive, to co-presidents of Fox News.\n\nThe decision to promote Shine, who was reportedly implicated in the sexual harassment allegations made by Laurie Luhn, a former Fox booker, has raised eyebrows within the network. Luhn received a $3.15 million settlement, and although Shine and Brandi, the general counsel, have denied any knowledge of Luhn's relationship with Ailes, the move to promote them has been seen as counter-intuitive by some.\n\nThe internal investigation, led by the white-shoe law firm Paul, Weiss, has been ongoing, with the company reportedly presenting the lawyers with a list of women to speak to. The promotion of Shine and Brandi, along with the retention of Dianne Brandi and Suzanne Scott, seems to suggest a compromise between the Murdoch generations, with the younger Murdochs pushing for change while the older Murdochs seek to maintain some semblance of the network's past success.\n\nAs the investigation continues, it remains to be seen how Fox News will navigate this period of transition and whether the network can truly move forward while maintaining its reputation and audience. One thing is clear, however: the departure of Ailes and the subsequent changes within the network mark a significant turning point in the history of Fox News.",
    " Title: White Nationalists Rally at University of Virginia, Clash with Counter-Protesters\n\nArticle:\n\nHundreds of white nationalists gathered at the University of Virginia on Friday evening, protesting against plans to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The group, which included both men and women, marched through the Charlottesville university, waving torches and chanting \"White lives matter\" and \"You will not replace us.\"\n\nThe rally, organized by Jason Kessler, who has previously accused the town of \"anti-white hatred,\" was met with counter-protesters. Clashes between the two groups occurred, and the local mayor, Mike Signer, condemned the march as a \"cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism, and intolerance.\"\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post reported that the crowd also chanted \"Jew will not replace us\" during the event. Demonstrators held lit torches, some of which were described as a reference to the Ku Klux Klan, and chanted \"Blood and soil\" and \"One people, one nation, end immigration.\"\n\nA smaller group of counter-protesters had gathered around the university's statue of Thomas Jefferson, holding a banner that read \"VA Students Act Against White Supremacy.\" The marchers were tightly organized and primarily white and male, in their twenties and thirties. They chanted \"You will not replace us,\" \"Blood and soil,\" and \"Our streets.\"\n\nViolent clashes occurred when the counter-protesters reportedly sprayed pepper spray at the marchers. Police moved in and the marchers extinguished their torches, filling the air with acrid smoke. One protester, Robert Ray, a writer for the white supremacist site Daily Stormer, was heard shouting, \"The heat here is nothing compared to what you're going to get in the ovens.\"\n\nA larger \"Unite the Right\" rally is planned in the city on Saturday. The protest was criticized by many local residents and politicians, with Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer calling the march \"a despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus.\"\n\nCharlottesville is known as a liberal college town, with 86% of the county voting for Hillary Clinton in last year's presidential elections. However, the town has become a focal point for white nationalists after the city council voted to remove a statue of General Lee. Some observers also argue that President Donald Trump's election to the White House re-energized the far right across the US.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization, states that \"Trump's run for office electrified the radical right, which saw in him a champion of the idea that America is fundamentally a white man's country.\" Last month, Ku Klux Klan supporters staged a march in Virginia, but were outnumbered by counter-protesters.",
    " Title: Trump Calls for International Pressure on North Korea, Criticizes Iran and Venezuela at UN General Assembly\n\nArticle:\n\nUS President Donald Trump is set to address the United Nations General Assembly later today, calling for increased international pressure on North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. The speech, scheduled for 10:30 New York time (14:30 GMT), will be Trump's first address to the world body.\n\nAccording to White House officials, Trump will refer to Islamist militants as \"losers\" and criticize Iran and Venezuela in his speech. The President has previously hinted at the possibility of the US withdrawing UN funding.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has stated that if the US withdraws from international affairs, the void left will be filled by others. Trump is expected to urge UN member states to act against North Korea's \"destabilizing, hostile, and dangerous behavior.\"\n\nNorth Korea stated on Monday that further sanctions and pressure would only accelerate its nuclear program. The country has conducted repeated missile tests this year and its sixth nuclear test earlier this month.\n\nTrump will also express concern about Iran in his speech. Last week, he stated that Iran had \"violated the spirit\" of a 2015 deal aimed at stopping it from developing a nuclear weapon. The US President has been a frequent critic of the agreement.\n\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated last week in London that Iran was not contributing positively to regional security \"through their actions to prop up the Assad regime [in Syria],\" engaging in \"malicious activities in the region,\" and \"aggressively developing ballistic missiles.\"\n\nA White House official briefing reporters on Trump's speech stated that Iran and North Korea presented a \"shared menace\" to the world. The official added, \"Nations cannot be bystanders to history, and if we do not confront the threats now, they will only gather force and become more formidable.\"\n\nTrump was at the UN on Monday and held meetings with some world leaders, in addition to attending a special meeting on UN reform. He told the leaders of some Latin American countries that the situation in Venezuela was \"totally unacceptable,\" calling it a socialist dictatorship. He stated that the US was \"prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists.\"",
    " Title: White House Tensions: Trump's Frustration with Sessions Persists, Firing Not Imminent but Possible\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a developing turn of events, the White House has expressed ongoing frustration with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, following a series of tweets from President Trump criticizing Sessions' handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's alleged crimes. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in an interview with \"Fox & Friends,\" neither confirmed nor denied reports of discussions regarding Sessions' potential dismissal, but did not rule out the possibility.\n\nSanders stated, \"That frustration certainly hasn't gone away, and I don't think it will.\" When asked about Trump's desire for Sessions' removal, she responded, \"That's a decision that, if the president wants to make, he certainly will.\"\n\nThe president's tweets, which began by questioning the absence of an investigation into Clinton's connections to Ukraine, escalated with Trump labeling Sessions as \"VERY weak\" on Clinton's supposed crimes. Sessions has been under fire since last week, following harsh criticisms from Trump in a New York Times interview.\n\nDespite the ongoing speculation, Sessions was reportedly in \"good spirits\" during a meeting at the White House on Monday, according to Department of Justice officials. If Trump were to fire Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would be elevated to the top post on an acting basis.\n\nTrump's intensifying criticism has fueled speculation that Sessions may resign, even if Trump opts not to fire him. The president ignored a shouted question about whether Sessions should step down during a White House event. Sessions, however, has stated his intention to stay in his post.\n\nThe relationship between Trump and Sessions, who were once close, has been strained. Sessions' decision to recuse himself from all matters related to the Russia investigation has been a point of contention for the president. Sessions and Trump's conversations in recent weeks have been infrequent, and efforts to mend their relationship have not been successful.\n\nThe possibility of Trump firing Sessions and the potential consequences, including the potential removal of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, remains a topic of discussion among White House and outside advisers. Newt Gingrich, a frequent Trump adviser, suggested that the president's criticisms were simply a venting of feelings, but noted that such comments could have a negative impact on staff morale.",
    " Title: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Rejects Trump's Proposal for Federal Agents in City, Cites Safety Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has escalated tensions between the Trump administration and local politicians, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has rejected the idea of deploying federal agents in the city to quell protests and address violent crime. The rejection comes after President Trump threatened to send federal officers to Chicago, following a weekend where over a dozen people were killed and 63 others were wounded by gunfire.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Lightfoot sent a letter to the White House, stating that bringing in federal agents would be dangerous and make communities in Chicago unsafe. The mayor suggested alternative measures such as universal background checks, federal enforcement of existing laws, and help from the federal government on illegal gun sales.\n\nIn the letter, Lightfoot wrote, \"What we do not need, and what will certainly make our community less safe is secret, federal agents deployed to Chicago. Any other form of militarized assistance within our borders that would not be within our control or within the direct command of the Chicago Police Department would spell disaster.\"\n\nLightfoot also requested more aid for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives officials and federal prosecutors. As a former federal prosecutor herself, Lightfoot is no stranger to federal law enforcement.\n\nDuring an interview with Joy Reid on MSNBC Monday night, Lightfoot stated, \"If they try it, I'm going to use every tool at my disposal to stop them. We still have a constitution, we still have laws on the books, and I'm going to use those to deploy against them. We're not going to have tyranny in the city of Chicago. It's just not going to happen.\"\n\nThis rejection follows the Trump administration's deployment of federal agents to Portland, Oregon, which has sparked controversy and protests. The president has long pledged to send in federal troops to stop violent crime in inner cities and has criticized mayors for not being able to address the problem. The Department of Homeland Security is reportedly putting together plans to send about 150 agents to Chicago, according to the Chicago Tribune.",
    " Title: Study Finds Majority of Google's Top News Sources Lean Left, Google Maintains Algorithmic Neutrality\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study from the Computational Journalism Lab at Northwestern University has found that a significant proportion of Google's top news sources lean towards left-leaning perspectives, but the tech giant maintains that its search results are apolitical.\n\nResearchers Daniel Trielli and Nicholas Diakopoulos analyzed the results of more than 200 news-related questions every day in November 2017. They found that 86% of Google's Top Stories came from only 20 news sources, with three sources dominating the coverage, accounting for 23% of all impressions. CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post accounted for 10.9%, 6.5%, and 5.6% of the impressions, respectively.\n\nThe study's methodology involved counting an \"article impression each time one of those links appears.\" However, the study's methodology drew some concerns about potential duplication of certain links skewing the impression count and the fact that the study considered results from 2017, a time when Google makes thousands of changes to its search engine each year.\n\nGoogle, through its spokesperson, argued that its algorithms cannot detect political affiliations or sentiments when collecting content, but rather measure a variety of factors, including relevance, timing, and authoritativeness of a source. The company stated that its algorithms are designed to elevate news from authoritative sources and require publishers to be transparent and accountable to be represented in news results.\n\nThe study also compared the list of sources to another study that measured the ideological affiliation of a news outlet by analyzing the political stances of those sharing content on Facebook. From that, they found that 62% of the impressions were from sources considered left-leaning, and only 11% from right-leaning outlets.\n\nGoogle confirmed Mr. Diakopoulous theory, noting that bigger outlets have much more manpower to put out more articles, and their engine essentially crowdsources based on available content. In light of the growing scrutiny on how Google might be able to influence the news cycle, the company launched its own \"How News Works\" page, stating that it does not have an editorial point of view and is committed to fostering a healthy and diverse news ecosystem. The website states, \"We don't have an editorial point of view. Instead, Google products are designed to connect you with a broad array of information and perspectives to help you develop your own point of view and make informed decisions.\"",

He asserted that the Clinton Foundation, which raises funds for various charitable causes, is beneficial due to its focus on providing aid to those in need.\n\n\"The good would be that we wouldn't be gabbing about it here,\" Carville said. \"The bad would be that we would be out hundreds of millions of dollars that are doing good. What the Clinton Foundation does is it takes money from rich people and gives it to poor people. Most people think that's a pretty good idea.\"\n\nCarville acknowledged that, from a political perspective, the Clinton Foundation's operations might not have been ideal given Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. However, he maintained that the foundation's humanitarian work was significant.\n\n\"If you ask me as a political adviser, of course,\" he replied. \"If you ask me as a human being \u2013 nah, I'm not too sure. As a human being I think [the foundation] does an enormous amount of good.\"\n\nCo-host Joe Scarborough countered Carville's argument, stating that the charity could have functioned effectively without Bill Clinton spearheading fundraising efforts.\n\n\"That's BS,\" Scarborough said. \"The fact is, if it's a great charity and it's a five-star rated charity, guess what, other people can raise the money. It doesn't have to be Bill Clinton calling somebody up making them think, 'You know what, if I give him money, it could help me out.' If it's a great charity, it can stand on its own and other people can raise money for it. It's not a zero-sum game. It's not having Bill Clinton raise money while his wife is running for president or we're all going to hell and little kids are going to die across the planet.\"\n\nCarville's assertion that \"somebody is going to hell over this\" due to the foundation's work sparked controversy, with Scarborough labeling the claim as \"BS.\" The discussion underscores the ongoing debate surrounding the Clinton Foundation and its role in the political landscape.",

Stephanopoulos, who posted a story summarizing the conversation, said Cohen indicated a readiness to cooperate with Mueller and the New York prosecutors.\n\nWhen asked about his potential cooperation, Cohen stated that his lawyer, Guy Petrillo, would provide guidance on such decisions. In a statement, Cohen said, \"My wife, my daughter, and my son have my first loyalty and always will. I put family and country first.\"\n\nIn April, Trump had tweeted that Cohen, a \"businessman\" he had always liked and respected, would likely flip if given the opportunity to avoid legal trouble. However, Cohen, in his interview with Stephanopoulos, stated that he would not be used as a \"punching bag\" in anyone's defense strategy.\n\nMueller's investigation into Russian ties to the 2016 Trump campaign has led to charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn, ex-campaign officials Paul Manafort and George Papadopoulos. Several other aides have also left the administration in connection with the probe.\n\nFederal investigators have been examining Cohen's business dealings, including payments to adult-film star Stormy Daniels and other women who claimed they had affairs with Trump. In April, investigators raided Cohen's home and office. Since then, Trump's personal lawyers, Cohen's attorneys, and federal officials have been embroiled in a legal battle over access to millions of documents.\n\nCohen, in his interview, expressed respect for the prosecutors and the process, stating that he would not do or say anything that might be perceived as interfering with their investigation. The full extent of Cohen's potential cooperation remains to be seen.",
    " Title: White House Announces Trump National Doral as Venue for 2020 G7 Summit, Sparking Ethics Concerns\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House announced on Thursday that President Donald Trump's Miami golf resort, Trump National Doral, will host next year's Group of Seven summit, a decision that has sparked criticism from ethics experts and lawmakers who argue it represents a blatant use of the president's office to boost his business empire.\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney announced Trump National Doral as the host venue, citing the resort's location and amenities. Mulvaney stated that the president will not profit from the event as the resort will be booked \"at cost.\" However, foreign dignitaries attending the June 10-12 summit will have no choice but to spend money at Trump's resort during the event.\n\nEthics lawyer Kathleen Clark of Washington University School of Law in St. Louis stated, \"He is daring anyone to prevent him from further enriching himself from the presidency.\" The decision comes amid several lawsuits accusing Trump of violating the Constitution's emoluments clause, which bans the president from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments.\n\nMulvaney dismissed such concerns, as well as the idea that the summit at Trump's Doral golf course would be a promotion for his brand. \"Donald Trump's brand is strong as it is,\" Mulvaney said. \"It's the most recognized name in the English language.\"\n\nTrump himself raised the idea during a brainstorming session on possible sites, stating, \"What about Doral?\" Mulvaney noted that Trump National Doral was \"far and away the best physical facility\" among a dozen potential sites that were narrowed down to four finalists. He added that holding the event at Doral would be dramatically cheaper and save \"millions.\"\n\nCritics noted that the Doral resort, the biggest source of revenue among Trump's 17 golf properties, appears to have been struggling since before he became president. Financial disclosure reports filed by the president show revenue is barely growing, up just $1 million last year, to $76 million. The Trump Organization itself has admitted it was struggling, arguing in a tax appeal to local authorities last year that it is \"seriously underperforming.\"\n\nThe Doral, which Trump purchased out of bankruptcy in 2012 for a reported $150 million, also faces a heavy debt load. At the end of last year, Trump had two mortgages on the resort, one for more than $50 million and another for as much as $25 million.\n\nNoah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, stated, \"The president is now officially using the power of his office to help prop up his struggling golf business.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, among the Democrats in Congress who have sued the president over the emoluments issue, saw it as far more troubling. \"It's so brazen and craven,\" he said. \"It's virtually saying, 'To heck with the rule of law.'\"\n\nAdded U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, \"The emolument clauses of the Constitution exist to prevent exactly this kind of corruption.\"\n\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to questions about Doral's finances. Instead, it issued a statement saying that it is \"excited to have been asked to host\" the summit and \"honored by this recognition.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
    " Title: Michael Cohen, Former Attorney to President Trump, to Serve Remainder of Prison Sentence in Home Confinement Amid Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's former lawyer and longtime fixer Michael Cohen will be released from federal prison to serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCohen is currently incarcerated at FCI Otisville in New York after pleading guilty to numerous charges, including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. He will remain under quarantine for 14 days before his release. Federal statistics show 14 inmates and seven staff members at the prison have tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nAfter his release, Cohen will serve the remainder of his sentence at home. According to a Justice Department official and another person familiar with the matter, they could not discuss Cohen's release publicly and spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nPrison advocates and congressional leaders have been pressing the Justice Department for weeks to release at-risk inmates ahead of a potential outbreak, arguing that the public health guidance to stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars.\n\nAttorney General William Barr ordered the Bureau of Prisons earlier this month to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates, beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hot spots. Otisville is not one of those facilities.\n\nAs of Thursday, 473 federal inmates and 279 Bureau of Prisons staff members had tested positive for the coronavirus at facilities across the U.S. Eighteen inmates have died since late March.\n\nMany federal inmates have been seeking home confinement as the number of coronavirus cases grows in the federal prison system, but advocates have accused the Bureau of Prisons of moving too slowly to release inmates. The Bureau of Prisons said it had moved more than 1,000 inmates to home confinement since March 26, when Barr first issued a directive to increase its use in late March. The agency said it is a \"tremendous logistical lift that was accomplished through the marshaling of all of BOP's resources.\"\n\nThe Justice Department official said Barr had told senior officials at the Bureau of Prisons when he first issued his directives that they must scrupulously apply the same criteria to all inmates and not give anyone special treatment.\n\nA federal judge had denied Cohen's attempt for an early release to home confinement after serving 10 months in prison and said in a ruling earlier this month that it \"appears to be just another effort to inject himself into the news cycle.\" But the Bureau of Prisons can take action to move him to home confinement without a judicial order.\n\nCohen, 53, began serving his sentence last May and was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021. Other high-profile inmates have also been released as the number of coronavirus cases soars. Last week, a judge ordered Michael Avenatti\u2014the attorney who rose to fame representing porn star Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump\u2014to be temporarily freed from a federal jail in New York City and stay at a friend's house in Los Angeles. Avenatti had said he was at high risk of getting the coronavirus because he had a recent bout with pneumonia and his cellmate at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan was removed due to flu-like symptoms.\n\nFormer New York state Senate leader Dean Skelos, 72, who was also serving a sentence at Otisville, is also expected to be released soon from prison to home confinement after testing positive for the coronavirus, prosecutors told a judge Wednesday. CNN first reported Cohen was being released to home confinement. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment.",
    " Title: Trump Refuses to Endorse Ryan, McCain Amidst Intensifying GOP Divisions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has declined to endorse the re-election campaign of the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the party's 2008 nominee, Senator John McCain, as divisions within the GOP continue to intensify.\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post, Trump stated, \"I like Paul, but these are horrible times for our country. We need very, very strong leadership. And I'm just not quite there yet. I'm not quite there yet.\" His comments were presumably a reference to Ryan's earlier statement in May, when the House speaker was asked if he was backing Trump: \"I'm just not ready to do that at this point. I'm not there right now.\"\n\nTrump's refusal to support McCain and Ryan comes amidst a series of racially and religiously charged statements from the nominee. Both Ryan and McCain are longtime critics of Trump, but both have said they would support the Republican nominee in the general election.\n\nRyan's campaign responded through a spokesman, Zack Roday, who said, \"Neither Speaker Ryan nor anyone on his team has ever asked for Donald Trump's endorsement. And we are confident in a victory next week regardless.\"\n\nIn recent months, Ryan and McCain have been critical of Trump's comments. In June, Ryan described Trump's attacks on a federal judge, Gustavo Curiel, as \"the textbook definition of a racist comment,\" and McCain issued a strong rebuke of Trump's remarks about the Muslim family of a dead army captain on Monday.\n\nRyan also criticized Trump for his comments, saying, \"Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice.\"\n\n\"Captain Khan was one such brave example,\" he added. \"His sacrifice \u2013 and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan \u2013 should always be honored. Period.\"\n\nEven Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor and a Trump ally, broke rank to tell reporters that Trump's remarks on the Khan family were inappropriate.\n\nTwo weeks after a party convention that attempted to focus on party unity, new rifts are appearing between Republicans and their candidate. On Tuesday, the retiring New York representative Richard Hanna became the first Republican member of Congress to say he would vote for Hillary Clinton in November, saying of Trump: \"He is unfit to serve our party and can not lead this country.\"\n\nLater the same day, the Hewlett-Packard executive Meg Whitman, a prominent Republican fundraiser, also threw her support behind Clinton. \"Donald Trump's demagoguery has undermined the fabric of our national character,\" she said.\n\nThey join dozens of high-profile GOP leaders who have previously said they would not vote for Trump, including the party's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, and the former Florida governor Jeb Bush. With the Khan row ongoing, the New York Times reported that mass defections by Republican politicians were now a possibility.\n\nIn his harshest comments about Trump yet, President Barack Obama on Tuesday described him as \"unfit\" and \"woefully unprepared\" to be president, urging Republican party leaders to take the unprecedented step of denouncing their nominee.\n\nAway from the frontline of politics, veterans and the families of soldiers killed in war continue to call on Trump to apologize for his treatment of the Khan family. Dakota Meyer, one of a handful of living Medal of Honor recipients and the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin's son-in-law, wrote Tuesday on Twitter:\n\n\"If @realDonaldTrump wants to be the Commander in Chief, he needs to act like one. And that can't start until he apologizes to the Khans.\"\n\nTrump's refusal to support McCain and Ryan comes exactly one week before Ryan faces a primary challenge from the businessman Paul Nehlen, a candidate who has sought to emulate Trump's rhetoric and policies. Nehlen has branded Ryan \"a soulless globalist\" and attacked him as the candidate of open borders.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump praised Nehlen for running \"a very good campaign.\"\n\nMcCain is also facing a primary challenge at the end of August from Kelli Ward, a former Arizona state senator who has accused the 2008 Republican nominee of being \"directly responsible for ISIS.\" If the five-term senator manages to fend off the primary challenge, he still faces a competitive general election against the Democratic representative Ann Kirkpatrick, in what McCain has described as \"the race of my life.\"\n\nAlthough Arizona was once solidly Republican, the heavily Latino state is now considered an electoral toss-up because of Trump's unpredictable effect on candidates whose names follow his own on the ballot. For over a year, McCain has also called on Trump to apologize for saying he prefers \"people who weren't captured\" to prisoners of war, like the senator was himself in Vietnam. Trump has not apologized.",
    " Title: Eurozone Leaders Agree to New Bailout for Greece, Pending Parliamentary Approval\n\nArticle:\n\nEuropean leaders have agreed in principle to a new bailout package for Greece, worth approximately $96 billion, following a marathon summit in Brussels. The agreement, which is Greece's third bailout since 2010, aims to secure Greece's place in the Eurozone and prevent a potential exit that could have destabilized the entire currency union.\n\nThe bailout comes with stringent economic reforms, including pension cuts, higher taxes, and the sale of some government assets. The key to the deal is Greece's commitment to implement these reforms and provide proof of compliance.\n\nGreece's Parliament must approve these measures by Wednesday. In addition, Europe will assign monitors to ensure that Greece will also have to give up control of the proceeds from government sales, with the bulk being earmarked for debt payments.\n\nGreece had been pushing for some of its massive debt load to be canceled, but Europe rejected this demand. However, they have agreed to consider easing the terms with longer grace periods.\n\nThe deal is still a proposal and faces potential resistance in Greece's Parliament. Greece urgently needs the European Central Bank to restart money flows to re-open its shuttered banks, but the ECB has yet to announce its readiness to do so.\n\nThe leaders hammered out the agreement after weeks of frantic diplomacy following Greece's decision to walk away from a previous bailout program, leaving it without the cash to make a payment to the International Monetary Fund, triggering the closure of its banks, and sending the economy into free fall.\n\nThe new bailout requires Greece to give access to bailout monitors on the ground in Athens, including officials from the IMF, a point that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras resisted. The agreement will raise questions about Tsipras's ability to continue in his post, given his election promises to reverse austerity and end intrusive monitoring.\n\nWithout a new bailout, Greece's economic situation would have worsened, bringing the country ever closer to exit from the Eurozone. Greece's banks have been shut for two weeks, and cash withdrawals are capped. The vital tourism industry is suffering, and the healthcare system is running out of imported medicines.\n\nGreece needs to pay pensions and wages this week and make a significant debt repayment to the European Central Bank next week. Without an injection of funds, it would have to issue IOUs, a first step to printing its own currency.\n\nAssuming Greece accepts a broader overhaul of the economy, there are still potential roadblocks standing in the way of a third bailout. A handful of other Eurozone countries, including Germany and Finland, will need to win votes in their parliaments this week on a new rescue. Only then can formal negotiations begin.",
    " Title: Democratic Presidential Candidates' Stances on Abortion Rights Agenda in 2020 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent Democratic presidential debate held in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 20, 2019, the candidates' positions on abortion have come under scrutiny. The New York Times has surveyed all 2020 Democratic presidential candidates on the issue of abortion and found that the field has coalesced around an abortion rights agenda more far-reaching than any past nominees have proposed.\n\nAmong the top-tier candidates, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and Bernie Sanders advocate for forcing all private insurers to cover elective abortions and making the abortion drugs misoprostol and mifepristone available over the counter. Joe Biden did not provide an answer to either of these questions.\n\nAll of the candidates favor repealing the Hyde amendment in order to provide unlimited taxpayer funding of elective abortions for Medicaid recipients. Only South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg says that, as a practical matter, he'd be willing to sign a budget that includes the Hyde amendment, while the other candidates dodge the question.\n\nAs for restrictions after 24 weeks of pregnancy, only Joe Sestak said yes, while Tulsi Gabbard, who did not complete the survey, has also expressed support for restrictions in the third trimester. The rest of the top-tier candidates - Buttigieg, Warren, and Sanders - oppose any restrictions after 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn comparison, the last Democratic presidential candidate who won the White House, Barack Obama, told a Christian magazine in 2008 that he thought it was appropriate for states to restrict or even prohibit late-term abortions as long as there is a strict, well-defined exception for the health of the mother.\n\nThe 2020 Democrats' positions on abortion rights represent a significant shift from past nominees. The candidates prefer to call for abortion to be \"affordable\" or \"accessible\" rather than \"rare.\" Only Tulsi Gabbard, Joe Sestak, and Marianne Williamson now say abortion should be \"safe, legal, and rare\" - a phrase popularized by President Bill Clinton and repeated by Hillary Clinton, which reflected a search for common ground with people not fully supportive of abortion rights.\n\nOut of all the candidates running for president in 2020, only Joe Sestak (a candidate most Democrats have never heard of) is willing to tell the Times he favors some modest legal restrictions on abortion after viability. The other candidates have not expressed support for any restrictions after 24 weeks of pregnancy.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Threaten to Let Bush-Era Tax Cuts Expire, Signaling Potential Fiscal Cliff Showdown\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that signals a potential showdown over the fiscal cliff, Senate Democrats have indicated their willingness to let the Bush-era tax cuts expire at the end of the year unless Republicans agree to President Obama's plan to raise taxes on America's top earners.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, made the statement during an address Monday afternoon at the Brookings Institution. If a deal is not reached this year, Murray suggested, Democrats may let the country fall off the fiscal cliff, a term used to describe the combination of tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect in 2013.\n\nThe fiscal cliff is approaching as the Bush tax cuts are set to expire, and billions of dollars in automatic spending cuts, a result of last summer's debt-ceiling debate, are set to take effect. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are hoping to shift around these spending cuts to spare key areas like defense, and to temporarily extend the Bush tax rates for at least some Americans.\n\nMurray's statement underscores the heated debate over the Bush tax cuts and the risk it poses for the American people. President Obama is pushing for an extension of the rates only for American households making less than $250,000, and a tax hike for those earning more than that.\n\nIn her speech, Murray argued that if all the tax cuts expire, it will diminish the Republican argument that the Democratic plan is a tax hike, as any change to the tax code in 2013 would be a tax cut. Murray also suggested that if Republicans do not negotiate to the Democrats' liking on the automatic spending cuts, known as the \"sequestration,\" set to take effect at the start of next year, her party would let those cuts happen, too.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, claim Democrats are standing in the way of relief for millions of Americans. In the Republicans' weekly radio address, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) accused Obama of pushing a tax hike that will hurt employment.\n\nThe political strategy underscores the heated debate over the Bush tax cuts and the risk it poses for the American people. Both parties are accusing the other of threatening to trigger tax hikes in 2013. Murray, while openly making that threat in her speech Monday, also preemptively argued that Republicans would be to blame if that happens.",
    " Title: Sen. Al Franken Advocates for Transparency in Surveillance Programs, Calls for Balance between National Security and Privacy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent statement, Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) emphasized the need for transparency in the U.S. surveillance programs, highlighting the importance of balancing national security and privacy concerns. Franken's comments come in the wake of the Edward Snowden leaks, which revealed the extent of domestic surveillance activities and sparked a national debate on civil liberties.\n\nFranken stated, \"We need to know who, when, and how, to judge if surveillance crosses a line.\" He expressed concern that, due to the secretive nature of these programs, Americans have no way of knowing the scope of these programs, their privacy protections, and the legal authorities they operate under.\n\nThe senator pointed out that, for years, the architecture of the programs designed to keep the U.S. safe has been a secret to all but a few members of the intelligence community and select legislators. Companies involved in these programs were also bound by strict gag orders, making it impossible for them to discuss the programs publicly.\n\nFranken argued that the government must give proper weight to both keeping America safe from terrorists and protecting Americans' privacy. However, he noted that, without transparency, Americans have no way of knowing whether the balance is right.\n\nSince joining the Senate, Franken has been working to address this issue. He has supported amendments to the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that would have required greater public reporting on the use of surveillance authorities and greater disclosures about the legal opinions and safeguards that support them.\n\nFranken clarified that he did not vote against renewing these laws because he wanted to end them or because he thought they were unnecessary. Instead, he wanted to send a strong message to his colleagues that transparency was critical and that there was too little of it in place.\n\nThe senator is currently working on legislation that would require the federal government to annually report on how it uses key authorities under the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This legislation would also allow companies to publicly report on how many Patriot and FISA orders they receive and how many of their customers these orders affect.\n\nFranken believes that this level of transparency can be achieved without harming national security. He cited Google's reporting on the number of national security letters it receives as an example, stating that such disclosures have not hurt anyone.\n\nAs chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, Franken is committed to ensuring that privacy laws keep pace with technology. He emphasized the need for a public conversation about what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy, given the advancements in technology and surveillance capabilities.\n\nFranken concluded, \"In 2013, we're long overdue for another public conversation about what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy. It's hard to have that debate around secret programs authorized by secret legal opinions issued by a secret court. Actually, it's impossible to have that debate.\"",
    " Title: White Nationalist Protesters Return to Charlottesville Two Months After Deadly Clashes\n\nArticle:\n\nWhite nationalist protesters have returned to the US town of Charlottesville two months after the violent clashes that resulted in the death of a woman. The town's mayor, Mike Signer, described the small group's appearance at the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee as \"another despicable visit by neo-Nazi cowards.\"\n\nThe brief torch-lit rally, organized by far-right figure Richard Spencer, took place in Emancipation Park, where the statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee is located. The statue was also the venue for the \"Unite the Right\" rally in August, which was held to oppose plans to remove it.\n\nCounter-demonstrator Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when a participant drove into a group of counter-protesters at high speed during the August rally. Between 40 and 50 people are thought to have attended the rally in Emancipation Park, with the statue of Gen. Lee covered up while a legal challenge to its removal takes place.\n\nIn a video live-streamed by Mr. Spencer, protesters could be heard chanting \"You will not replace us\" and \"We will be back.\" The group, all dressed similarly and holding lit torches, could also be heard chanting \"The south will rise again\" and \"Russia is our friend.\" Another speaker said the group was there to \"represent white America's interests\" and criticized the local community and the media.\n\nPolice said the group left the park shortly before 20:00 (0:00 GMT). Mayor Signer said officials were looking at legal ways to prevent further events.\n\nRichard Spencer is the founder of a right-wing website and think-tank and has made a series of controversial comments at public events, including allegedly advocating \"peaceful\" ethnic cleansing. The US has been gripped by a national debate on whether to remove Confederate symbols from the US civil war because of their association with slavery. After the violence in Charlottesville, many local governments acted to remove Confederate monuments.",
    " Title: Judge Dismisses Claims Against Exxon Mobil in New York Climate Change Lawsuit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, a New York State Supreme Court judge has ruled in favor of Exxon Mobil in a climate change lawsuit, marking the second such trial in the United States to reach a verdict. The decision was a setback for the New York Attorney General's Office, which had brought the case.\n\nJustice Barry Ostrager, presiding over the trial, stated that the attorney general's office failed to prove that Exxon Mobil had violated any laws. Ostrager emphasized that the case was about securities fraud, not climate change, and that Exxon Mobil's actions did not meet the criteria for securities fraud.\n\nThe three-week trial saw New York state prosecutors argue that the oil company had downplayed the financial risks it faced from potential climate regulation. Attorney General Letitia James argued that this misrepresentation made Exxon's assets appear more secure than they were, affecting its share price and defrauding investors.\n\nHowever, Ostrager concluded that James' office \"failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that ExxonMobil made any material misrepresentations that 'would have been viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.'\"\n\nFollowing the verdict, James released a statement, saying that the case had compelled Exxon to answer publicly for its internal decisions that misled investors. \"Throughout this case, we laid out how Exxon made materially false, misleading, and confusing representations to the American people about the company's response to climate change regulations,\" James said.\n\nExxon Mobil responded, stating that the ruling \"affirms the position ExxonMobil has held throughout the New York Attorney General's baseless investigation. We provided our investors with accurate information on the risks of climate change.\"\n\nThe case, which attracted high-profile attention, included the testimony of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Exxon's CEO from 2006 to 2017. The trial marked a significant step in the ongoing legal battles between oil companies and authorities over climate change and its impact on business operations and investments.\n\nThe ruling comes as Exxon Mobil faces similar lawsuits in Massachusetts and other pending cases across the United States. The Massachusetts Attorney General, Maura Healey, has accused ExxonMobil of systematically misleading investors about climate change's impact on the economy and its own business, and of deceiving consumers about fossil fuel's environmental impact.\n\nIn other jurisdictions, city and state governments are using \"public nuisance\" arguments to hold energy companies accountable for their role in climate change. The aim is to force them to help pay for the mounting impact of climate change that communities now struggle to address. Fossil fuel companies often attempt to get these cases moved to federal courts, which they believe will be more sympathetic to their side.",
    " Title: Obama's 2015 Budget Proposal Lifts 2013 Spending Caps, Adds Billions in New Government Expenditures\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has unveiled a $3.99 trillion budget proposal for the 2015 fiscal year, which aims to lift the spending caps imposed in 2013 and increase government spending in various sectors. The budget proposal, which is already facing criticism from Republicans, seeks to replace what the President calls \"mindless austerity\" with \"smart investments\" that strengthen the nation.\n\nIn a speech at the Department of Homeland Security, President Obama stated, \"I'm not going to accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward. It would be bad for our security and bad for our growth.\" He emphasized the importance of maintaining a balance between national security and economic security, stating, \"I will not accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national security and our economic security.\"\n\nThe President's budget proposal aims to end sequestration and fully reverse the cuts to domestic priorities in 2016. It also plans to match the investments made domestically with increases in defense spending. The President addressed the expected opposition from the Republican party, which includes tax increases, stating, \"If they do not agree with me, that's fine: That's how democracy works. You may have noticed they usually do not agree with me.\"\n\nThe President's budget proposal would spend $37 billion more than the caps allow on domestic programs. This additional funding would be used for initiatives such as an expanded child care tax credit and subsidies to help students attend community college at no cost. The President is also proposing an extra $38 billion in defense spending, which would help fund the ongoing fight against the Islamic State and military support for NATO allies affected by Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nTo offset these costs, the President is proposing higher taxes on big banks and the wealthy. His plan would raise approximately $210 billion over the next decade by increasing the capital gains tax rate and taxing gains on inherited wealth. A new financial fee on highly leveraged banks would generate an additional $110 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThe President is also proposing a one-time, 14 percent tax on the profits that U.S. corporations have amassed overseas. This would raise an estimated $238 billion to help fund improvements to roads, bridges, and other public works.\n\nRepublicans, who now control both chambers of Congress, are unlikely to approve the President's proposed tax hikes. However, they may be willing to give ground on the spending caps. Cory Fritz, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, stated, \"Republicans believe there are smarter ways to cut spending than the sequester and have passed legislation to replace it multiple times, only to see the President continue to demand tax hikes.\"\n\nThe President's budget would reduce the federal deficit to $474 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. This represents 2.5 percent of the overall economy, and White House forecasters expect the deficit to remain at a manageable 3 percent of GDP or less throughout the 10-year budget window. However, this is contingent on Republicans agreeing to a substantial boost in tax revenues.\n\nThe President has already scrapped one idea from the budget: a plan to tax 529 college savings accounts. This proposal faced opposition from both Republicans and Democrats, and the administration quickly withdrew it after a storm of protest.\n\nWhile the President defends his budget as an exercise in \"middle-class economics,\" a preliminary analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found otherwise. Forecasters at the center say while the wealthiest Americans would pay higher taxes under the President's plan, most of the benefits would go to those at the bottom of the income ladder. The 60 percent of Americans in the middle would more or less break even.",

Ajjawi, a 17-year-old Palestinian resident of Tyre, Lebanon, is facing uncertainty about his education at Harvard University after being detained and deported by American immigration officials at Boston Logan International Airport last Friday.\n\nUpon arrival, Ajjawi, whose enrollment at Harvard was made possible by a scholarship from a nonprofit organization, faced questioning from immigration officials, along with several other international students. While the other students were allowed to leave, Ajjawi alleges that an immigration officer continued to question him about his religion and religious practices in Lebanon.\n\nAccording to the Crimson, the same officer then asked him to unlock his phone and laptop, and left to search them for approximately five hours. After the search, the officer questioned him about his friends' social media activity.\n\nIn a statement, Ajjawi wrote, \"When I asked every time to have my phone back so I could tell [ someone ] about the situation, the officer refused and told me to sit back in [ my ] position and not move at all.\" After five hours, the officer called him into a room and began shouting at him, stating that she found political viewpoints opposing the U.S. on his friends' social media accounts.\n\nAjjawi claims he has no political posts on his timeline and responded that he should not be held responsible for others' posts.\n\nUniversity officials told the Crimson they are still attempting to resolve the situation in time for Ajjawi to be in class when the semester starts on Sept. 3. The Crimson's report states that Ajjawi's enrollment at Harvard was made possible by a scholarship from a nonprofit organization.",
    " Title: Unprecedented White House Press Conference: A Rorschach Test for Trump's Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an extraordinary turn of events, President Donald Trump delivered a highly charged and unconventional news conference at the White House on Thursday. The event, marked by Trump's unyielding criticism of the media, was a spectacle that captivated audiences across the nation.\n\nThe conference served as a stark indictment of the media, with Trump accusing the press of peddling \"fake news\" and engaging in a relentless campaign to undermine his administration. The event was met with mixed reactions, with supporters viewing it as a masterful takedown of a biased media, while critics deemed it a display of unhinged behavior.\n\nTrump's criticisms were not without merit. He rightfully pointed out the unprecedented flood of illegal leaks that have been damaging to his administration and the inaccurate reporting that has tarnished the reputation of his associates. The Washington Post's report that Michael Flynn had not been truthful about his past contacts with the Russian ambassador was accurate, leading to Flynn's dismissal.\n\nHowever, Trump's tone was often over-the-top, with claims that today's headlines would be about him \"ranting and raving,\" while his administration was running like a \"fine-tuned machine.\" The president's criticism of a Wall Street Journal report that some spies are withholding sensitive intelligence from him was misplaced, as the story's fourth paragraph quoted a White House official denying the allegations. Trump also questioned the credibility of a New York Times piece on earlier contacts with Russia by aides and associates, which is currently under FBI investigation.\n\nTrump's most revealing comments were directed at CNN and the media at large. He accused some journalists of harboring \"hatred\" for him, a sentiment he had expressed during his campaign but now, as commander-in-chief, it raises concerns about the president's relationship with the press.\n\nUltimately, the effectiveness of Trump's administration will be determined by its ability to accomplish the big-ticket items on its agenda, rather than by its ability to control the narrative through press conferences. Accomplishing these goals would be real news, not fake.",
    " Title: Colorado Court of Appeals Upholds Employer's Right to Fire Medical Marijuana Users\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a ruling that could have significant implications for medical marijuana users in Colorado, a three-judge panel at the Colorado Court of Appeals has upheld an employer's right to terminate employees who test positive for marijuana, even if they are participating in the state's medical marijuana program.\n\nThe ruling, announced Thursday, comes in the case of Brandon Coats, a quadriplegic medical marijuana user who was fired by Dish Network after testing positive for marijuana. Coats, who was rendered quadriplegic in a car accident, qualified for Colorado's medical marijuana program. However, there was no evidence that Coats was intoxicated at work at the time of his termination.\n\nCoats sued Dish Network to regain his job, arguing that a Colorado law protected him from being fired for engaging in lawful activities outside of the workplace. A district court ruled against Coats, stating that Dish was able to terminate Coats due to federal laws against marijuana. The Colorado Court of Appeals upheld that ruling on Thursday.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Judge Janice Davidson wrote, \"We agree that the general purpose of [ the worker protection law ]... is to keep an employer's proverbial nose out of an employee's off-site off-hours business. We can find no legislative intent to extend employment protections to those engaged in activities that violate federal law.\"\n\nCoats and his lawyer have stated that they will take the case as high as the Colorado Supreme Court. Coats' lawyer, Michael Evans, told Reuters, \"If someone's going to pick a fight with the federal government, it will be the state supreme court and not the court of appeals.\"\n\nColorado is one of 20 states (not including the District of Columbia) that has legalized marijuana for medicinal use. In November, both Colorado and Washington voted to legalize marijuana for recreational use as well. However, the federal government still considers marijuana an illegal substance, and this ruling reflects that status.",

The candidates' itineraries, reminiscent of a mayoral campaign in New York City, reflect a shift in political strategy as demographic changes transform the American political landscape.\n\nDuring a recent campaign stop at Todos Supermarket in Woodbridge, Virginia, McAuliffe, flanked by Democratic Del. Alfonso Lopez, the only Hispanic member of the state Legislature, emphasized the importance of an open and welcoming state to all residents. McAuliffe pledged to pass a state-level DREAM Act and expressed a desire to see more individuals like Carlos Castro, the supermarket's San Salvador-born owner, in Virginia.\n\nCuccinelli, on the other hand, has attended meetings with the Pakistan American Business Association and the Moroccan American Network, celebrated Filipino-American culture at festivals in Richmond and Virginia Beach, and given interviews to Indian, Korean, Moroccan, and Vietnamese-oriented media, among other outreach events.\n\nBoth candidates' focus on outreach has been particularly intense, with McAuliffe celebrating the Lunar New Year with Korean, Chinese, and Vietnamese groups, addressing a meeting of the Democratic Latino Organization of Virginia, and holding a special campaign kickoff aimed at the Asian-American and Pacific-Islander communities. He has also joined Filipino-American festivals and posted a \"Ramadan Kareem!\" message on Facebook to mark the Muslim holy month.\n\nThe political logic behind these itineraries is straightforward: while Virginia has always had a sizable African-American population, the last 10 years have seen a significant increase in other nonwhite voting groups. In the 2004 presidential race, Latino voters made up 3% of the Virginia electorate, and Asians made up 2%. By 2012, those numbers were 5% for Latinos and 3% for Asians\u2014a combined 60% increase in those two heterogeneous groups. In a low-turnout election, this shift could be decisive.\n\nCuccinelli, who won multiple state Senate elections in a Fairfax-based district, near the epicenter of Virginia's demographic change, has expressed confidence in his ability to connect with diverse communities. He told a group of Asian-American business leaders in late July that he has been doing outreach for years, and without it, he might not have won his 2007 legislative race.\n\nHowever, Cuccinelli's outreach efforts have not been without controversy. During a recent meeting in Richmond with Asian-American Virginians, Cuccinelli emphasized his long ties to the state and his involvement in local institutions. He also expressed a desire for internationally savvy constituencies to be better represented in the state's economic development agencies and boards. However, his stance on immigration, particularly his support for Virginia's controversial \"show me your papers\" law, has cast a shadow over his campaign.\n\nIn contrast, McAuliffe has emphasized his commitment to passing a state-level DREAM Act and welcoming immigrants to Virginia. The political landscape in Virginia is changing, and both candidates are adapting their strategies to reflect this shift. The outcome of the election could set a precedent for future off-year elections in states undergoing similar demographic transformations.",
    " Title: President Trump Vows to Protect Thanksgiving Name, Addresses Controversial Holiday Criticisms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a rally in Sunrise, Florida, on Tuesday, President Donald Trump pledged to safeguard the traditional name of the annual Thanksgiving holiday, amidst ongoing debates about the holiday's origins and impact.\n\nTrump stated that some individuals, whom he referred to as the \"radical left,\" are advocating for a change in the name of Thanksgiving, preferring alternative terminology. The president expressed his opposition to these attempts, drawing parallels with the controversy surrounding Christmas, a holiday that celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ.\n\n\"As we gather together for Thanksgiving, you know, some people want to change the name Thanksgiving,\" Trump said. \"They don't want to use the term Thanksgiving.\"\n\nThe president went on to say, \"But now we're going to have to do a little work on Thanksgiving. People have different ideas. Why it shouldn't be called Thanksgiving. But everybody in this room, I know, loves the name Thanksgiving. And we're not changing.\"\n\nThe president's comments come after a series of articles questioning the environmental impact of traditional Thanksgiving celebrations. HuffPost, a liberal news outlet, published an article earlier this month titled, \"How much damage are we doing with our epic Thanksgiving meal every year?\" The article suggested reducing meat consumption, minimizing travel to reduce carbon emissions, and addressing food waste.\n\nThis led to a flurry of reports on Fox News about a supposed \"war on Thanksgiving.\" Social media users responded with the hashtag \"#WhatLiberalsCallThanksgiving\" to mock the president's remarks. One user, who identified as Native American, suggested instead naming the fourth Thursday of November a #nationaldayofmourning, highlighting the historical significance of the day for many Native Americans.\n\nSince 1970, Native Americans in New England have organized an annual protest on the same day as Thanksgiving, gathering at noon on Cole's Hill in Plymouth. The protest is known as the National Day of Mourning, and it serves as a reminder of the genocide, land theft, and cultural assault experienced by Native Americans.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Trump pardoned two Thanksgiving turkeys \u2013 Bread and Butter \u2013 and wished Americans a Happy Thanksgiving. The president also made light of the ongoing impeachment inquiry, joking that the turkeys had received subpoenas to appear before Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA), the lead impeachment inquiry prosecutor.\n\n\"It seems the Democrats are accusing me of being too soft on turkey,\" Trump quipped, addressing the pardoned birds. \"But Bread and Butter, I should note that unlike previous witnesses, you and I have actually met. It's very unusual.\"",
    " Title: Target Corporation Drops Health Care Plan for Part-Time Workers, Cites Obamacare as Preferred Option\n\nIn a move that could potentially impact the employer-based health care market, retail giant Target Corporation has announced it will discontinue its health care plan for part-time workers. The company, based in Minneapolis, will provide a $500 cash payment to each employee affected by the change.\n\nIn a blog post on Tuesday, the company's top human resources official explained that the move was prompted by the new health insurance marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which the company believes could offer more favorable health care coverage options for its part-time team members.\n\nThe company stated that less than 10% of its employees participate in the company's health care plan for part-timers, but the move has raised questions about the potential influence of the Affordable Care Act on employer-based coverage, which is the primary source of health insurance for a majority of Americans.\n\nAnalysts suggest that employers may be inclined to move health care coverage into the individual market and state-based exchanges, where individuals may be eligible for government subsidies based on income. This shift could potentially result in cost savings for companies, as they may no longer bear the full burden of health care expenses.\n\nTarget is not the first company to adjust its health care plan in response to the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. In August, UPS announced it would drop health care coverage for about 15,000 employees' spouses who are eligible for coverage from their own workplaces.\n\nThe impact of Obamacare on the employer-based market is complex, with factors such as premium changes and the political climate influencing the analysis. However, given the early problems with HealthCare.gov and the individual market, many critics are poised to blame any premium increases on the law.\n\nTarget has assured that employees who work 20 to 31 hours will still be eligible for vacation, dental, disability, life insurance, and 401(k) benefits. The company also stated that it has no plans to reduce hours as part of the move. Employees interested in working more hours can discuss their availability with their managers.\n\nIn a separate matter, the House of Representatives, with the help of 67 Democrats, passed a bill requiring the federal government to notify consumers within two days if their personal data has been breached on online-based insurance markets tied to the health care overhaul. This move was reportedly prompted by the millions of Target customers who had to monitor their bank accounts after hackers stole their credit card numbers.",
    " Title: Obama Tries to Clarify Agenda for Second Term as Polls Show Tight Race in New Hampshire\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a bid to address criticism from Republican nominee Mitt Romney regarding the lack of a clear agenda for a second term, President Barack Obama visited New Hampshire on Thursday to rally supporters and outline his plans. The visit marked the president's first since September 7, as polls indicate a tightening race in this crucial swing state.\n\nAccording to a Suffolk/7News poll conducted on Monday, the candidates are tied at 47% each in New Hampshire, a shift from two weeks ago when Obama led Romney by an average of 6 percentage points. The poll suggests that voters are uncertain about Obama's intentions for a second term, with Romney perceived as having an edge in addressing economic issues.\n\nDuring his speech, Obama outlined his agenda for a second term, which includes hiring 100,000 more teachers, boosting domestic energy production, creating more manufacturing jobs, and cutting the deficit. He also argued that his second term would serve as a bulwark against repeating the mistakes made by his Republican predecessors.\n\nObama emphasized the progress made in reducing unemployment, stating that the rate has fallen from 10% to 7.8% since he took office. However, it is worth noting that the national jobless rate was 7.6% when Obama assumed office.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more details about his vision for the future, Obama discussed subsidizing college tuition, increasing U.S. exports, raising taxes on the wealthy, and promoting clean energy, which he claimed would create jobs and \"reduce the carbon pollution that's heating our planet.\"\n\nDespite the president's efforts, some supporters, like Cynthia Malbon of Manchester, expressed doubts about the clarity of Obama's vision for a second term. \"I don't know,\" she said. \"I'm skeptical that anything much is going to happen. It's probably going to be worse next time around.\"\n\nRon Chito, a retired utility worker who attended the rally, also expressed concerns about the lack of clarity in Obama's vision. \"If you're a good reader and you know what's going on, then you have a good idea what his policies are and where he's headed,\" he said. \"Hopefully, we can get more Democrats in the House and Senate so we can get a good jobs bill passed.\"\n\nAs with most of his campaign speeches, Obama spent a significant portion of his time criticizing Romney's economic plan, which includes across-the-board tax cuts for all wage earners. He argued that Romney's plan would not create jobs, reduce the deficit, or add up.\n\nObama also addressed the issue of women's health and healthcare, warning that Romney would repeal \"Obamacare,\" potentially allowing insurance companies to charge women more for healthcare coverage. He emphasized that the healthcare law passed by his administration puts healthcare choices in the hands of individuals, not employers or politicians.\n\nThe president also took a swipe at the Republican-led New Hampshire legislature on women's health, stating that they sometimes act as if they know better than women when it comes to women's own health care decisions. He also criticized Romney for his stance on funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nObama also addressed the fiscal cliff, stating that he wants to cut the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years, but the solution must include higher taxes on families earning more than $250,000. He emphasized that he would not cut education or research that grows the economy.\n\nThe Romney campaign responded, stating that Obama's leadership has failed over the past four years and that the economic future under him would be bleaker because he would not confront the looming fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax increases pending before Congress in January. They claimed that Romney has a real plan to create 12 million jobs and would work with members of both parties to cut spending, restore the AAA credit rating, and get the economy growing again.",
    " Title: President Obama Delivers Unifying Speech at Democratic National Convention, Emphasizes Modest Policy Goals and Criticizes Mitt Romney\n\nIn a speech that reflected the more subdued expectations of the 2012 election, President Barack Obama accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for a second term on Thursday, delivering a speech that was both optimistic and critical of his opponent, Mitt Romney.\n\nThe President, in a noticeably less buoyant mood compared to his 2008 speech in Denver, invoked the transformational legacy of Franklin D. Roosevelt to justify his reelection. However, the speech also contained a nod to the reality check of George H.W. Bush, as Obama urged a wary and worried electorate to stay the course, or risk a Romney presidency.\n\nIn contrast to the expectations of a roster of audacious policy proposals, Obama offered a hybrid of gritted-teeth optimism, hammer-blow attacks on Romney's foreign policy inexperience, and relatively modest policy goals, including a vow to create 1 million new manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe President's speech focused heavily on Romney's foreign policy, a weakness for Obama in 2008 but a stronger electoral ground for a seasoned commander in chief. He criticized Romney for his stance on Russia, China, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe economic and political realities of the reelection year necessitated some messaging improvisation and a lot of creative downsizing of his blue-sky appeal from four years ago. Obama acknowledged that the path to solving the challenges that have built up over decades would be difficult and would require common effort, shared responsibility, and bold, persistent experimentation.\n\nOver the past two years, Obama's advisers have struggled with a fundamental messaging dilemma: how to make the case for reelection on a half-recovery, how to tell people what he's done for them, without claiming he's made everything better. The President's speech on Thursday seemed to address this dilemma, offering a more modest vision for his second term.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Unveil Police Reform Bill Addressing Racial Disparities in Law Enforcement\n\nArticle:\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-SC) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) were joined by fellow Republican lawmakers at a news conference on Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol, where they unveiled the GOP's legislation aimed at addressing racial disparities in law enforcement. The bill, titled the JUSTICE Act, is the latest attempt by lawmakers to reform U.S. law enforcement in response to the ongoing pressure from activists following the death of George Floyd.\n\nThe bill includes several key provisions:\n\n1. Incentivizing law enforcement agencies to ban the use of chokeholds by tying funding to whether departments have prohibited the practice, except when deadly force is authorized.\n2. Ramping up data collection efforts to track when an officer's use of force results in death or serious harm.\n3. Providing federal funds for additional training on alternatives to the use of force.\n4. Including language recognizing the history of lynching in the United States.\n5. Requiring law enforcement agencies to send the attorney general reports on no-knock warrants.\n6. Creating a commission to study issues that affect Black men and boys.\n\nThe bill comes a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that encourages police departments to update their standards and strengthen efforts to track officer misconduct. The Senate Republicans' bill, in some ways, aligns more closely with the president's action than the sweeping legislative proposal put forward last week by congressional Democrats.\n\nThe Senate Republicans' bill does not address the issue of qualified immunity, a doctrine that largely shields officers from legal liability unless a plaintiff can show that their constitutional rights were clearly violated. The Trump administration has stated that amending qualified immunity is a \"non-starter.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court said Monday that it will not hear cases addressing the doctrine of qualified immunity. The GOP proposal also does not end the use of \"no-knock\" warrants in drug cases, as the Democratic bill does, and it would provide new funds to police departments for training.\n\nThe 106-page bill is led by GOP Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, one of three Black senators, and is backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky). Sen. Scott stated at the Capitol Hill news conference, \"The bill speaks to the fact that we believe the overwhelming number of officers in this nation are good people.\"",
    " Title: Amazon Eliminates Monthly Bonuses and Stock Awards for Warehouse Workers as Part of $15 Minimum Wage Implementation\n\nAmazon.com Inc. has announced the elimination of monthly bonuses and stock awards for its warehouse workers and other hourly employees, following the company's pledge this week to increase minimum pay to at least $15 per hour.\n\nAccording to two individuals familiar with Amazon's pay policies, warehouse workers previously received monthly bonuses that could amount to hundreds of dollars, as well as stock awards. The company informed these employees on Wednesday that these compensation categories would be discontinued to cover the costs of the wage increase, the sources said.\n\nAmazon's decision to raise its minimum wage received praise when it was announced on Monday. The pay increase has helped the company avoid criticism from politicians and activists, and positions Amazon well to recruit temporary workers for the upcoming holiday shopping season.\n\nDespite the elimination of bonuses and stock awards, hourly operations and customer service workers will still see an increase in their total compensation, according to a statement from Amazon. The company stated that the compensation will be more immediate and predictable, as it will no longer be incentive-based.\n\nWorkers whose pay was already above $15 per hour will receive hourly raises of $1, according to two individuals familiar with the matter who requested anonymity regarding Amazon's compensation practices. Some long-time workers have expressed frustration that their raises are smaller compared to newly hired workers who will see hourly pay increases of up to 40%.\n\nDavid DeBoskey, an accounting professor at San Diego State University, stated that a higher hourly wage that new workers immediately receive is a more effective recruiting tool in a tight labor market than stock options that take years to materialize, especially in the warehousing industry that experiences high turnover. Amazon plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers for the holiday rush this year, and temporary workers do not receive stock.\n\n\"In a tight labor market, when you're the leader paying $15 an hour, that's a big advantage,\" DeBoskey said. \"They probably realized people weren't applying for warehouse jobs for the stock options.\"",
    " Title: Bipartisan Meeting at White House Aims to Address DACA and Budget Deadline, but Tensions Remain High\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the January spending deadline approaches, a bipartisan meeting is set to take place at the White House on Tuesday, with the aim of moving closer to protecting hundreds of thousands of immigrants from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. However, a long-standing partisan divide over immigration policy and the looming budget deadline are posing significant challenges to the progress of the negotiations.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers involved in the ongoing discussions over the must-pass January spending deal have expressed frustration over the stalemate in talks, with Republicans accusing Democrats of holding the spending deal hostage until a resolution on DACA is reached. Senate Republican John Cornyn, the No. 2 in the Senate, stated, \"It seems to me that Democrats are holding that deal hostage for a DACA negotiation, and we are meeting at the White House tomorrow on a bipartisan basis with the President to see what that might look like.\"\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, argue that the White House has not been fully engaged in the negotiations and that a long and broad policy wish list released last week further irritated Democrats working on the immigration compromise. One Democratic aide described the White House's list as \"out of the realm of reality.\"\n\nThe anticipated meeting at the White House on Tuesday is expected to symbolize that President Donald Trump is growing more serious about finding a bipartisan resolution, but the inclusion of GOP lawmakers that Democrats view as openly hostile to finding a consensus deal on DACA adds tension to the negotiations.\n\nIn the background, details are still being worked out on what a plan to help recipients of DACA would look like, and a bipartisan group of Senate lawmakers led by Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois and Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina continues to negotiate. However, the tensions that existed in December but had been overcome with a holiday deadline are playing out in real time now between the two parties.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois, said on Monday afternoon that this meeting could be a \"flexion point\" where significant progress is made or not. In the House, bipartisan talks have been ongoing for months, and a group of senators led by Durbin and Graham acknowledge they need Trump to lay out clear priorities to move forward.\n\nThe thinking is that Trump, who secured the Republican Party's nomination by promising mass deportations and a border wall, can offer political cover for Republicans who may be fearful of backing any immigration bill that is viewed as amnesty among their base. With Trump's blessing, Republicans believe they can find a way to move ahead on DACA. Without it, the votes are compromised.\n\nThe bipartisan meeting at the White House on Tuesday comes after Trump met with Republicans last week at the White House, and Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona refused to attend, citing the lack of bipartisanship. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, formerly the Secretary of Homeland Security, will also be in the bipartisan meeting on Tuesday and has been leading outreach to lawmakers on Capitol Hill on the ongoing talks.\n\nThe list of lawmakers attending the meeting includes a host of lawmakers who would be expected, including Durbin and Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, a 2013 immigration reform veteran. However, the list also includes red-state Democrats like Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana, as well as Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, who frequently votes with Republicans on immigration and border issues - a sign that the White House is looking to pick off as many Democrats as it can even if it can't work with the party's key negotiators.\n\nFlake told CNN he is prepared to tell Trump on Tuesday that this DACA deal can not include a whole host of immigration policy changes but instead has to be narrowly focused if Republicans want to succeed. \"This is not a comprehensive reform bill,\" Flake said. \"We can't do one before March.\"\n\nIn addition to the bipartisan working group, conservatives including Cornyn and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa are having their own conversations, and Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma are also going to be at the White House on Tuesday.\n\nIn the House, multiple efforts are underway, many led by rank-and-file members. Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas and Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California have released their own bipartisan framework for a deal after weeks of negotiations. Aguilar is the whip for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. That deal focuses on DACA and border security, but the lawmakers hope additional measures could be added if necessary to finalize a deal.\n\nThe bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus - including Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, a longtime DACA advocate - had also been working to reach a compromise, but before the break was similar in concept to what the Senate group was working on. And, as in the Senate, a group of more conservative Republican lawmakers are working on their own proposal, including House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul of Texas and House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, which would be strongly to the right of most of the bipartisan compromises. Both men will also be at the White House on Tuesday.",
    " Title: \"In Obama's Second Term: A Look at Americans' Priorities and Suggestions for the President\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Obama begins his second term, the economy remains a top concern for many Americans. According to a recent CNN poll, nearly half of all Americans named the economy as the most important issue facing the nation today, followed by the deficit and health care. However, there are several other issues that Americans would like President Obama to address in his second term.\n\nCNN iReport challenged people to finish the sentence, \"In his second term, Obama should...\" and the responses were varied and surprising. One of the most interesting suggestions came from Cherry Davis, a struggling job seeker in Los Angeles. Davis believes that rebuilding the nation's infrastructure, part of what she terms \"a modern New Deal,\" would be the best thing Obama could focus on in his new term.\n\n\"I believe that our country is behind and it's because we are not rebuilding our infrastructure,\" Davis said. \"Instead, we are using the same methods that took place after the Great Depression. We need to rebuild our infrastructure from energy to roads to bridges.\"\n\nDavis believes that this would get America back to work, build a larger tax base, and bring the middle class back. \"Updating our nation will create jobs,\" she said.\n\nCNN.com commenter \"Leftcoastrocky\" agreed, stating, \"Our infrastructure has been neglected for a full generation and is making our economy less efficient and more expensive.\"\n\nEducation was another top concern for Americans, with education ranking fourth on the list of top issues during the election as voted by CNN.com readers and iReporters. Tyler Stocks, an Obama voter and rising East Carolina University student, mentioned this topic, stating that increasing college tuition and textbook prices have been a strain.\n\n\"I plan to transfer to a university in the summer but am worried about how to pay for it,\" he said. \"Even with financial aid, education has become a matter of affordability, and the whole idea of following your dreams is difficult when you can't afford to.\"\n\nMark Ivy, who voted for Mitt Romney, stated that Obama did not always show great leadership dealing with Congress in his first term. He thinks that should be the president's top focus now.\n\n\"The election returned divided government to Washington,\" said the Farmersburg, Indiana, resident. \"Yet it seems as we head into a new term for the president and with a new Congress, the helm of state remains without a definitive captain steering the ship.\"\n\nIvy, who has been disabled for the past decade, stated that the stress of the recent uncertainty over the economy, the fiscal cliff, and other issues has also been a burden.\n\n\"Having true leadership in the White House would affect me personally by providing more stability and certainty in knowing that my monthly Social Security check would continue to arrive without fear of it being disrupted or delayed, which could cause issues with buying my needed medicines, food, and meeting monthly living expenses,\" he said.\n\nSmall business owner Egberto Willies, a politically active Obama supporter, is concerned about the dwindling middle class.\n\n\"While I agree that we have a lot of problems to take care of, solving the income and wealth inequality is tantamount,\" he said.\n\nWillies believes the tax structure should be changed to resolve these issues.\n\n\"The reality is none of the other issues matter if the decline of the middle class continues,\" he said. \"If the decline of the middle class continues, immigration is not a problem because no one would want to come here. Gun control won't matter because the government will be forced to remove guns from people with nothing else to lose. Education won't matter as there would be no reason to be educated without a job that lifts or keeps one in the middle class.\"\n\nThe tax structure has also created a big conversation on CNN.com, as commenters went back and forth over corporate tax rates and how much taxes ought to be raised on the wealthy.\n\n\"Unless this country goes back to a tax structure pre-Reagan, all but the top 1% is doomed,\" said Bruce Rubin.\n\n\"As a small-business owner, there are years when I have made a lot of money and paid a lot of taxes on that,\" Willies said. \"It never once made me upset because I never thought I would make the kind of money I was making. Right now, my business is suffering because of the economy, and my interest in political activism has taken a hit. This means tax increases do not affect me much except in my investments.\"\n\nWhich issues would you say ought to be the priority over this next term? Did iReporters and commenters miss the mark by not talking about the economy? Share your thoughts below.",
    " Title: \"A Churchillian Vision: An In-depth Analysis of Benjamin Netanyahu's Leadership and Foreign Policy\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIsraeli columnist Ari Shavit, in his book \"My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel\" (2013), offers a unique perspective on the leadership and foreign policy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Shavit, who has known Netanyahu for nearly two decades, describes him as a complex individual, possessing both human foibles and extraordinary comprehension.\n\nNetanyahu, according to Shavit, has a deep, obsessive, and multidimensional Churchill complex. This complex, which has been a defining factor in Netanyahu's political career, is rooted in his ambition and his view of Iran as the Nazi Germany of the 21st century, Israel as the Great Britain of the same century, and himself as the voice in the wilderness.\n\nThis complex has led Netanyahu to scorn Democratic politicians and liberal intellectuals, viewing them as weak. He is more concerned with the global struggle between clashing cultures, viewing Ayatollah Khomeini's Iranians as evil and President Barack Obama's Americans as weak. Netanyahu's mission, as he sees it, is to avert the most colossal catastrophe the world has seen since Auschwitz by preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear arms, achieving regional hegemony, and annihilating the Jews.\n\nNetanyahu's focus and military training have allowed him to turn himself into a modern-day Churchill. He has maneuvered the Iranian nuclear threat to the top of the international community's agenda, invested massive resources in building an Israeli military option against Iran, and used this military option diplomatically. The fear of a potential Israeli attack on Iran led to the United States adopting a tough policy towards Tehran in 2011-12, with a resolute rhetoric, punitive sanctions, and a military threat.\n\nWhether Netanyahu seriously considered attacking Iran or was merely playing audacious strategic poker remains unclear. However, it is clear that up to a point, Netanyahu has succeeded in standing up to a totalitarian rival and enlisting the help of the American superpower, as his hero, Winston Churchill, did.\n\nShavit's portrayal of Netanyahu offers a nuanced and complex view of the Israeli prime minister, highlighting his ambition, strategic acumen, and the deep-rooted beliefs that drive his foreign policy decisions. Whether one agrees with Netanyahu's approach or not, his Churchill complex undeniably shapes his leadership and foreign policy, making him a significant figure in the contemporary political landscape.",
    " Title: Gender Dynamics Shift in Presidential Race as Romney and Obama Narrow Leads Among Men and Women\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the final stretch before Election Day, the race between Republican Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama remains a virtual dead heat, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll. The survey shows Romney favored by 47 percent of likely voters, with Obama trailing by a mere 2 percentage points at 45 percent.\n\nThe poll indicates that Romney has gained ground in several key areas, including the economy and understanding the public's problems. After a strong performance in the first debate and a generally positive month, Romney has narrowed the gap in both the economy and the understanding of the people's problems.\n\nIn terms of gender dynamics, Romney has erased Obama's 16-point advantage among women, with both candidates now tied at 47 percent. However, the Romney campaign is facing fallout from a comment made by a Romney-endorsed Senate candidate in Indiana, who stated that pregnancies resulting from rape are \"something God intended.\" Romney quickly distanced himself from the remark, but the Obama campaign has seized the opportunity to question Romney's stance on women's health care.\n\nThe poll shows that among female likely voters, 55 percent believe Obama would make the right decisions on women's issues, compared to 41 percent who think Romney would. Romney's pitch to women has been focused on the economy, but the poll indicates that message is taking root, with women favoring Romney on the economy by a narrow margin of 49 percent to 45 percent.\n\nObama, on the other hand, has been working to shore up his support among men, who tend to lean more Republican. In the 2008 election, men broke 49 percent for Obama to 48 percent for John McCain, even though Obama got 53 percent of the vote overall. The poll shows that Obama's lead among men has narrowed from 13 percentage points to 5 points.\n\nThe election outcome will ultimately depend on the battleground states, where polls still appear to favor Obama. As the election nears, Romney has been playing down social issues and trying to project a more moderate stance on matters such as abortion in an effort to court female voters.\n\nOverall, people are significantly more optimistic about the economy and unemployment in the coming year than they have been at any point in AP-GfK polling going back to March 2011. Nearly six in ten likely voters think the economy will improve in the next year, up from 46 percent last month. And 42 percent think the number of unemployed Americans will drop in the next year, up from 32 percent in September.",
    " Title: Ohio Early Voting Shows Enthusiasm Gap Favoring Hillary Clinton Over Donald Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing battle for voter enthusiasm, the hashtag #OHVotesEarly on Twitter has shown a significant gap favoring Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Republican nominee Donald Trump as early voting kicked off in Ohio. According to Twitter data, 75 percent of the tweets sent using the hashtag over the last 24 hours mentioned Clinton, while only 25 percent mentioned Trump.\n\nThe disparity in the hashtag's usage could be attributed to several factors. It was a Clinton supporter who first tweeted the hashtag on October 2, and her Ohio digital team has been actively promoting it. Additionally, the Trump campaign may have lost some momentum after the release of a controversial video over the weekend in which Trump is heard making lewd comments about women.\n\nThe latest poll by Baldwin Wallace University Community Research Institute shows Clinton surging in Ohio, with a lead of 9 percentage points over Trump in a four-way race and 11 percentage points in a head-to-head race. This is a drastic turnaround from just a month ago, when most polls showed Trump winning Ohio handily.\n\nThe Trump campaign, however, maintains that they are still confident in their ground game, with over 118,000 doors knocked by volunteers in Ohio over the weekend. Bob Paduchik, Trump's Ohio state director, said in a statement, \"Our campaign will be using every day of early and absentee voting to get out our voters, culminating in an Election Day win for Mr. Trump.\"\n\nEarly voting returns in other states also show Clinton with a slight advantage. According to a new report by NBC News and the voter data firm TargetSmart, Clinton has received more votes during the early voting period in Iowa, Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Carolina, while Trump is leading in Georgia and Florida.\n\nClinton campaign manager Robby Mook expressed optimism about the early voting results, particularly in Florida, where vote-by-mail requests are up by 77 percent among black voters and 80 percent among Asian American voters. In states like Ohio, Mook reported, one in every six absentee ballot requests came from Cuyahoga County, which President Obama won by 38 points in 2012.\n\nMook went as far as to suggest that Nevada, North Carolina, and Florida could be decided before Election Day. \"There is so much access to early voting, that we could build an insurmountable lead in those key states before Election Day,\" Mook said.\n\nHowever, even if the Clinton campaign can secure an early lead in key states, they may face a tougher challenge in convincing skeptical Trump supporters (and Trump himself) that the win was legitimate.",
    " Title: Trump Secures Landslide Victory in New Hampshire Primary, Outperforming Previous Incumbent Presidents\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the New Hampshire primary, President Donald Trump secured a significant victory, outperforming all previous incumbent presidents in the state. With 87 percent of precincts reporting, Trump garnered over 120,000 votes, more than doubling former President Barack Obama's 2012 vote total of 49,080.\n\nThis result surpasses the totals of other incumbent presidents. In 2004, then-President George W. Bush received 53,962 votes in the largely uncontested GOP primary in New Hampshire, and in 1996, incumbent President Bill Clinton received 76,797 votes in the state's primary.\n\nThe high turnout for Trump is attributed to a coordinated effort by the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign to drive up turnout in New Hampshire. The president himself rallied supporters at a packed event in Manchester, N.H., on Monday, the eve of the state's primary.\n\n\"Nine months from now, we are going to retake the House of Representatives, we are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House,\" Trump said to thunderous applause. \"We have so much more enthusiasm, it's not even close. They're all fighting each other.\"\n\nThe enthusiasm for Trump was palpable among his voters, with many expressing a level of support uncommon for an incumbent president. Jay McDonald of North Providence, R.I., said he \"100 percent\" supported Trump four years ago and \"nothing\u2019s changed.\" McDonald added, \"Hopefully he picks up more voters \u2013 the independent people \u2013 over that [impeachment].\"\n\nWhile Democrats had a strong turnout in the New Hampshire primary, the Democratic primary is still wide open, and there was almost nothing at stake for Trump in the New Hampshire race. His only primary challenger on the ballot was former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who had less than 10 percent of the GOP vote with 87 percent reporting.\n\nThe Trump campaign also reported a record turnout for an incumbent in the Iowa caucuses, which took place on the same night as the Democratic caucuses. About 176,000 Iowa Democrats attended their precinct caucuses, a slight uptick from 2016 but fewer than expected.\n\nThe New Hampshire numbers come as the president's supporters have been fired up in recent days. Last week, Trump was acquitted of two articles of impeachment, gave a largely well-received State of the Union, and ran up the score in Iowa. Meanwhile, Democrats have been dealing with the fallout of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tearing up Trump's speech at the end of the State of the Union and the ongoing Iowa caucus debacle that still does not have an official winner.\n\nWhen asked about the Democratic field outside of the president's New Hampshire rally, one of Trump's fervent supporters, Air Force Veteran Mike Grunwald, gave a frank assessment of the party's chances to unseat Trump in November.",
    " Title: Amash Forms Exploratory Committee for Presidential Run as Libertarian Party Seeks Nominee\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Justin Amash, a five-term incumbent from Grand Rapids and former co-founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, has formed an exploratory committee for a potential presidential run under the Libertarian Party (L.P.). The move comes three years after he first contemplated the idea, and just 22 days before the L.P. is scheduled to select its nominee.\n\nIn a tweet Tuesday night, Amash, the son of Middle Eastern immigrants, expressed his vision for a presidency that would restore respect for the Constitution and bring people together. He stated, \"Americans are ready for practical approaches based in humility and trust of the people.\"\n\nAmash, who became a sustaining member of the L.P. over the past two weeks, is the most high-profile presidential candidate and the first to concurrently hold elected office in the L.P.'s half-century of existence. He is arguably the favorite nationally known politician among libertarians, having led congressional attempts to deconstruct the surveillance state, restore legislative-branch responsibility, and stand athwart the federal firehose yelling \"Stop!\"\n\nHowever, Amash's lack of active engagement with the L.P. in the past year has drawn criticism from some within the party. Future of Freedom Foundation founder Jacob Hornberger, an anti-war/anti-Fed stalwart who has been the dominant candidate thus far in non-binding L.P. primaries and caucuses, has been withering in his critiques.\n\nHornberger's critique reflects his self-interest but will nonetheless find resonance among even Amash-enthusiast Libertarians, who have become snippy about the congressman's long Hamlet act. Anarchist activist Adam Kokesh, for one, has been energetically campaigning for president since at least the beginning of 2018.\n\nIn the only 2020 three-way poll thus far, Morning Consult found just 1% of 1,992 registered voters saying they'd vote for Amash over Joe Biden and Donald Trump. His potential impact on the presidential swing state of Michigan is something both parties will be looking at with interest, though a highly polarized political climate following a razor-thin presidential election tends to be numerically brutal for minor candidates.\n\nAs of now, there is no word on whether Amash will officially withdraw from his own reelection campaign, though he cannot seek both offices come November. The L.P. is scheduled to select its nominee on May 23, but the physical and legal status of the national convention is in coronavirus limbo, and its Austin hotel abruptly canceled the event on Sunday. The L.P. National Committee may decide to reschedule the event, giving Amash more time to convince wary delegates for a fourth consecutive election to select a candidate who has won office only as a Republican.",
    " Title: U.S. Surpasses 100,000 COVID-19 Deaths, Leading the World in Cases and Fatalities\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States has surpassed the grim milestone of 100,000 coronavirus-related deaths, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. This makes the U.S. the country with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths worldwide.\n\nAs of 6 p.m. Eastern Time on May 27, the U.S. has reported 100,047 deaths, a figure equivalent to the entire population of mid-sized cities like Albany, N.Y. or Boca Raton, Fla. This number surpasses the lives lost during the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the September 11, 2001 attacks combined.\n\nThe U.S. also leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases, with nearly 1.7 million cases reported as of May 27, according to Johns Hopkins data. This number is likely an underestimate due to inadequate testing capacity and the number of people who develop mild illnesses and do not seek medical attention.\n\nDaily U.S. coronavirus cases and deaths have declined substantially since a peak in April, including in many of the country's hardest-hit areas like New York City. However, experts have warned that rural areas may not have seen the worst of COVID-19 yet. During the week ending May 26, about 7,000 people in the U.S. died from COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 tracker.\n\nThough new diagnoses are starting to decrease, the U.S. is still experiencing a significant number of daily deaths. A top World Health Organization official warned on May 26 that \"we're right in the middle of the first wave [of coronavirus cases] globally\" and said \"we're still very much in a phase where the disease is actually on the way up\" in many parts of the world.\n\nExperts agree that, in the absence of a vaccine that can provide widespread immunity, social distancing is among the best and only ways to keep infection, hospitalization, and death rates as low as possible. A Columbia University analysis published May 20 estimated that 36,000 lives could have been saved if the U.S. broadly adopted social-distancing policies a week earlier than many places did, in mid-March. The 100,000 lives already lost in the U.S. serve as a painful reminder of what happened instead.",
    " Title: Obama Faces Challenges in Pursuit of Grand Bargain as Tax Increase Tactics Prove Controversial\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama is facing significant obstacles in his pursuit of a grand bargain, with the most formidable hurdle being the $600 billion tax increase he implemented in December. At the time, Obama celebrated the new taxes on the wealthy while preserving George W. Bush's cuts for other income brackets. However, this victory now appears more like a missed opportunity than a political or policy triumph.\n\nThe $600 billion in tax increases may be the only new revenue Obama can expect, falling far short of the $1.6 trillion he desires or even the $1 trillion-plus that was discussed during previous grand bargain negotiations. Obama had hoped to confront Republicans over the sequester, compelling them to double the size of his tax increase to avoid significant defense cuts. However, his strategy proved unsuccessful.\n\nRepublicans, having accepted the $600 billion in tax hikes, have made it clear they are no longer open to further tax increases during this Congress. This is the primary reason top Democrats and Republicans alike believe talk of a grand bargain this time around is overhyped, though Obama's recent charm offensive indicates he recognizes the need for a comprehensive deal more than ever.\n\n\"Nobody is even talking about a grand bargain,\" one of the Senate's most influential Democratic leadership aides told us. \"It is not even on our radar right now.\" An adviser to Speaker John Boehner echoed this sentiment, stating that the window for a grand bargain was closed by Obama's hardball tactics since the tax hike. \"He missed the chance,\" the adviser said.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the diminished prospects of a grand bargain is the strained relationship between Obama and Republicans on Capitol Hill. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) recounted an exchange he had with Obama at Saturday night's white-tie Gridiron dinner. During a break in the program, McCarthy approached an empty chair next to Obama, only to find the president engrossed in his BlackBerry.\n\nMcCarthy joked with Obama about waiting for his dinner invitation, referencing the president's recent evening out with Republican senators. Obama responded by mentioning House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan and suggesting that Republicans give him credit for less action than they assume. As McCarthy walked away, he felt that Obama, in his words, \"still [is] a law professor... He'd rather lecture you and put a red mark on your paper than talk to you.\"\n\nThese challenges underscore the difficulties Obama faces in securing a grand bargain, with the tax increase strategy and the strained relationship with Republicans on the Hill being key factors in the diminished prospects for a comprehensive deal.",
    " Title: Newly Released Text Messages Suggest FBI Officials Knew No Charges Would Be Filed Against Hillary Clinton Before Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department has released additional text messages between two FBI officials who were removed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. The newly discovered messages, according to lawmakers, appear to indicate that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page knew that charges would not be filed against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as a result of the investigation into her email server before Clinton was interviewed by the bureau.\n\nStrzok and Page were pulled off the probe last summer after it emerged that some of their messages to each other included anti-Trump content. Strzok, an FBI counterintelligence agent, was reassigned to the Bureau's human resources division after the discovery of the exchanges with Page, with whom he was having an affair.\n\nOn July 1, 2016, in one exchange between Strzok and Page, they referenced then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch's decision to accept the FBI's conclusion in the Clinton investigation. Lynch's announcement came days after it was revealed that the attorney general and former President Bill Clinton had an impromptu meeting aboard her plane in Phoenix.\n\n\"Yeah, that is awful timing,\" Page agreed in the exchange. In a later message, she added, \"It's a real profile in courage, since she knows no charges will be brought.\"\n\nFour days later, then-FBI Director James Comey announced that no charges would be brought against Clinton, even though, as he put it, her actions in regard to the private server were \"extremely careless.\"\n\nAnother exchange from the day before referenced a change to Comey's statement closing out the investigation. While an earlier draft of the statement said Clinton and President Barack Obama had an email exchange while Clinton was \"on the territory\" of a hostile adversary, the reference to Obama at first was changed to \"senior government official\" and then omitted entirely in the final version.\n\nThe Justice Department released hundreds of text messages that the two had traded before becoming part of the Mueller investigation last month. Many focused on their observations of the 2016 election and included discussions of the Clinton investigation. Republican lawmakers have contended the communication reveals the FBI and the Mueller team to be politically tainted and biased against Trump \u2014 assertions Wray has flatly rejected.\n\nIn a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, asked whether the FBI had any records of communications between Strzok and Page during that five-month window and whether the FBI had searched their non-FBI phones for additional messages. He also asks for the \"scope and scale\" of any other records from the Clinton investigation that have been lost.\n\nA source on the committees receiving the texts told Fox News it was \"outrageous\" that the FBI had not previously indicated that the five-month gap in the messages existed. The source said it was incumbent on the FBI to prove that the missing texts do not constitute \"obstruction\" of congressional oversight or \"destruction of evidence.\"\n\nThe source added that congressional investigators want to know if the Justice Department's inspector general has copies of the messages.",
    " Title: Investigative Journalist Sharyl Attkisson Exposes \"Smear Machine\" in New Book\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Renowned investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson has exposed a hidden agenda in politics in her latest book, \"The Smear: How Shady Political Operatives and Fake News Control What You See, What You Think, and How You Vote.\" In a recent interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588's Jenna Browder, Attkisson discussed the book and the \"smear machine\" that targets journalists, whistleblowers, and political figures to manipulate public opinion.\n\n\"There's an industry that is paid to go after and target journalists, whistleblowers, political figures, whatever it may be, and inundate our consciousness and the images we see to try to ruin, destroy, or smear the idea that they don't like or the person who's delivering it on behalf of paid corporate or political interests,\" Attkisson explained.\n\nAttkisson cited a smear artist who said, \"Everything you see is put there for a reason.\" She added, \"It's like a movie. It's like a scene in a movie that the images that you come across, whether it's what a comedian jokes about on a national program, whether it's social media, whether it's on the news, it's put there for a reason, often by someone who paid a lot of money to put it there.\"\n\nAttkisson pointed to the 2016 election as a prime example of the \"smear machine\" operating at full speed. \"There was the idea in the past that conservatives had the edge, but for 2016, going into that race, all seem to agree that Democrats had control of the messaging, particularly when it came to using the news media,\" she said. \"To the extent conservatives try to control the news message \u2013 yes, they would like to just as much \u2013 but they don't have as much of a receptive ear in the news media so they're not able to do it as effectively.\"\n\nIn the book, Attkisson uses statistics from emails returned through Freedom of Information Act requests and information exposed by outlets like WikiLeaks. \"These groups say how they were able to influence the narrative. They name names. They talk about the news publications and networks that publish the stories they wanted them to publish. I've even published emails between journalists and these interests that they're supposed to cover, showing what I call transactional journalism, which I think is ethically inappropriate when they're making deals with the news makers,\" she said.\n\nAlthough Democrats may have been more effective, Republicans ultimately won. Attkisson suggests that voters are becoming more media-savvy. \"Are people getting wise to these techniques? Are they seeing through some of the narratives? I think it's fair to say 90 percent of the news narrative was in one direction, and yet Donald Trump still managed to overcome what this huge machine had built against him,\" she said.\n\nAttkisson was asked whether she agrees with President Trump that the Russia probe is a political witch hunt. \"President Trump is correct when he says that this is a 'witch hunt' in some respect based on the evidence to date and based on Obama's own intel experts who not only didn't see any evidence of collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians by their own account, but also by the account of all public information, Democrats and Republicans alike, who haven't seen the connection and yet, you've seen it dominate the news narrative,\" she said. \"I call it like the Brady Bunch, 'Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.' You just hear, 'Russia, Russia, Russia' all the time, and there have been wildly incorrect reports from some formerly top-respected news outlets in the nation about all of this, and in some cases, they haven't even corrected or done mea culpas when what they report has been found to be false.\"\n\nWhether it's Russia coverage or any other story, Attkisson emphasizes the importance of stepping back and asking questions, approaching nearly everything you see or read with a healthy dose of skepticism. \"Nearly every image that's put before them, in the words of the people who operate in this universe, is put before them for a reason by an interest that is often not disclosed. That should make you question when you see themes and memes coming up on social media and common ideas expressed over and over again. That should make you question, who's behind it? Who wants me to think this way?\"",
    " Title: Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS Poll Shows President Obama Leading in Key Battleground States\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a new poll conducted by Quinnipiac University, The New York Times, and CBS, President Barack Obama is leading his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, in three crucial battleground states. The poll, which surveyed likely voters, shows Obama with a significant lead in Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Florida, Obama has a six-point lead with 51% of likely voters favoring him, compared to 45% who lean toward Romney. In Ohio, the lead narrows to five points, with Obama at 50% and Romney at 44%. In Pennsylvania, Obama's lead widens to 11 points, with 53% of likely voters supporting him, and 42% backing Romney.\n\nThe poll also reveals that Obama is viewed more positively by voters in each state, with at least 50% holding a favorable opinion of him. Conversely, Romney is underwater on favorability in all three states, performing the worst in Pennsylvania, where only 39% of voters hold a favorable view of the former Massachusetts governor, compared to 47% with an unfavorable opinion.\n\nThe poll suggests that voters supporting Romney in all three states are more likely to back him due to their dislike of Obama, rather than their support for the Republican candidate. In Florida, 14% of Obama supporters cite their dislike for Romney as their reason for voting, while 60% of Obama voters in Ohio and 59% in Pennsylvania strongly support the president. In contrast, 19% of Romney supporters in Ohio and 22% in Pennsylvania support him due to their dislike of Obama, while 49% and 41% of Romney supporters, respectively, strongly favor him.\n\nWhile the numbers appear favorable for Obama, the poll also shows a greater sample size of Democrats in the poll. In Florida, 36% of voters identified as Democrats, compared to 27% Republicans and 32% independents. The split was nearly identical in Ohio, with 35% saying they were Democrats, 27% Republicans, and 32% independents. In Pennsylvania, 38% considered themselves Democrats, 32% Republicans, and 26% independents.\n\nVoters were also evenly split on which candidate would do a better job on the economy, the most important issue for voters in all three states. However, a majority of voters in all three states support Obama's plan to raise taxes on households making more than $250,000 to reduce the federal deficit, with 62% of Pennsylvania voters, 60% in Ohio, and 58% in Florida in favor of the plan.\n\nThe poll was conducted from July 24 through July 30 among 1,193 likely voters in Ohio, 1,168 likely voters in Florida, and 1,168 likely voters in Pennsylvania, through landline and cell phones.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 157,000 Jobs in July; Unemployment Rate Dips to 3.9 Percent\n\nThe United States economy continued its steady job growth trend in July, with the addition of 157,000 jobs and a decrease in the unemployment rate to 3.9 percent, as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor on Friday.\n\nThe job growth rate was lower than anticipated, with analysts expecting approximately 190,000 jobs to be added in July. The unemployment rate, which was 4 percent in June, met expectations by dropping to 3.9 percent.\n\nThe Labor Department revised the payrolls for the previous two months, with an upward revision of 59,000 jobs. The payrolls grew by 248,000 in June, up from the previously reported 213,000, and 268,000 in May, compared with the 244,000 last reported. Over the past 12 months, payrolls have been growing an average of 203,000 per month.\n\nJobs in manufacturing grew by 37,000, jobs in professional and business services were up 51,000, and leisure and hospitality jobs rose 40,000.\n\nAverage hourly earnings increased by 7 cents, to $27.05, marking a 2.7 percent increase over the prior year. This wage growth rate is the same as June's pace, despite the economy being at full employment and hiring managers struggling to fill open positions.\n\nEconomists had anticipated wage growth rates of about 3.5 percent, but the actual increase is lower. This discrepancy has led some economists to question the strength of wage growth, especially when considering the cost of living.\n\nThe economy picked up significantly in the second quarter, with a 4.1 percent pace, which is the strongest in nearly four years. This growth was driven by increases in consumer spending and exports.\n\nSome economists attribute this growth to temporary factors, such as the Republican tax cuts and increased export shipments ahead of retaliatory tariffs by China on U.S. agricultural products.\n\nPresident Trump described the numbers as \"very sustainable,\" stating, \"This is not a one-time shot... Next quarter, I think it's going to be outstanding.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve acknowledged the strength of the labor market and the overall economy, stating that job gains have been strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. The central bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged but has signaled that it will hike them twice more this year.",
    " Title: The Amnesty Debate and the Republican Party: A Closer Look at John McCain's Immigration Stance and Its Impact on Latino Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 presidential election, the Republican Party found itself in a precarious position, particularly in terms of the Latino vote. John McCain, who had been a vocal advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, nearly alienated a significant portion of the party with his support for amnesty, according to Rich Lowry's analysis.\n\nThe rush by GOP elites to embrace an amnesty for illegal immigrants was a response to the election results, where President Barack Obama won the Latino vote by a substantial margin. However, it is argued that this reaction was a combination of panic, wishful thinking, and ethnic pandering rather than a realistic approach to winning over Latino voters.\n\nJohn McCain's support for amnesty did not result in a significant improvement in his performance among Latino voters compared to Mitt Romney in 2012, as exit polls indicate. McCain garnered 31% of the Latino vote in 2008, while Romney received 27% in 2012. This suggests that the Republican candidates' positions on immigration may not have been the primary factor influencing their performance among Latino voters.\n\nThe common thread between McCain and Romney, both Republicans advocating for conservative economic policies, might have played a more significant role in their showing among Latinos. The Census Bureau's data reveals that among native-born Hispanics, 50% of households with children are headed by unmarried mothers, and about 40% of all households receive benefits from a major welfare program. This suggests that these households may not be natural Republican voters.\n\nFurthermore, Latinos tend to hold liberal attitudes towards government, as evidenced by their support for government-funded health care. An ImpreMedia/Latino Decisions poll conducted on the eve of the 2012 election found that 61% of Latinos support keeping Obamacare, while 66% believe the government should ensure access to health insurance. This could be attributed to the fact that 32% of non-elderly Latinos lack health insurance, nearly double the national average.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over amnesty and immigration reform within the Republican Party, as exemplified by John McCain's stance, should be viewed in the context of the party's historical performance among Latino voters and their political leanings. While it is important for the GOP to reach out to this demographic, it is crucial to understand that their attitudes towards government and welfare programs may not align with traditional Republican values.",
    " Title: Defense Secretary James Mattis Resigns, Citing Policy Differences with President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Defense Secretary James Mattis has resigned, citing policy differences with President Donald Trump in a letter released on Thursday. Mattis' resignation comes a day after President Trump made the abrupt decision to withdraw 2,000 troops from Syria.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Mattis reiterated his \"core belief\" in America's alliances and partnerships, particularly NATO, and the need for the U.S. to be \"resolute and unambiguous\" in challenging countries such as China and Russia.\n\n\"My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion on these issues,\" Mattis wrote. \"We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.\"\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis has resigned, citing policy differences with President Donald Trump. Here's the letter: <twitter link>\n\nThe tone of Mattis' resignation letter clashed with Trump's own announcement, which came shortly before the letter was released. Trump characterized Mattis' decision to quit as a retirement.\n\n\"General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served in my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years,\" Trump tweeted on Thursday evening.\n\nTrump credited Mattis with helping his administration with the \"purchase of new fighting equipment\" and helping Trump get \"allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations.\" Trump added that he would name a new secretary of defense shortly.\n\nMattis, a retired four-star general who went by the call sign \"Chaos\" in the Marine Corps, was considered by many to be one of the president's most critical Cabinet members in part because he acted as a strong check against Trump's worst national security impulses.\n\nWith him gone, National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will likely face less resistance as they offer more hawkish advice on North Korea, Iran, and more. Mattis had a mixed record of success with Trump. He opposed pulling out of the Iran deal; moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem; creating a Space Force; and starting a trade war with America's allies. But the now-former secretary failed to persuade Trump to see things his way on each of those issues, despite his good rapport with the president.\n\nPerhaps even worse, the president also kept Mattis out of the loop on other major military announcements, including halting military exercises with South Korea and banning transgender troops from the military. (Trump announced the latter while Mattis was on vacation.)\n\nMattis did have a few notable successes, though. He reportedly stopped Trump from ordering the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a move that would've escalated Syria's brutal civil war and brought the U.S. much deeper into the conflict.\n\nHe also ensured the Trump stuck to a diplomatic approach with North Korea rather than a military one. And he convinced Trump that torture was a bad idea.\n\nThe former Pentagon chief made some questionable decisions despite the president, too. Early on in the administration, he recommended an attack on terrorists in Yemen that led to the death of a Navy SEAL. He also convinced Trump to continue America's war in Afghanistan. He also avoided speaking on camera to press and curtailed media access to the Pentagon.\n\nUltimately, though, Mattis' tumultuous time paints a picture of a sharp mind and defender of America's traditional role in the world who struggled to agree with his boss on matters of life and death. And it seems clear from Mattis' resignation letter that he feels he can no longer perform that task.\n\nThe worry now is that, with Mattis gone, Trump is left with few if any moderating influences on his national security team. Mattis\u2014along with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, both ousted\u2014was frequently labeled one of the few \"adults\" in the room whose military and strategic expertise would help him gain Trump's trust and moderate the president's most dangerous foreign policy impulses.\n\nLike much in Trump's world, it didn't happen quite that way. But many still say they'll miss Mattis\u2014and that U.S. foreign policy may be worse off without him.\n\n\"I'd rather have Jim Mattis in the room than not in the room,\" Leon Panetta, one of former President Obama's defense secretaries, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in March, nearly 10 months before Mattis' ouster. \"His legacy will be he fought the good battle. But because of the nature of the president, it was one he couldn't win.\"",
    " Title: Biden's Interview with Charlamagne tha God: A Testy Exchange Turned Productive Dialogue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with popular radio host Charlamagne tha God, former Vice President Joe Biden found himself in a lively conversation that some may have labeled as a \"testy exchange.\" However, this characterization falls short of the reality of the situation. Charlamagne, known for his incisive questioning of politicians, held Biden accountable without resorting to an insufferable demeanor.\n\nThe interview, which lasted 18 minutes, covered a range of topics, including Biden's stance on the Democratic Party's relationship with black voters, his support of the 1994 crime bill, and his policy proposals for the future. The conversation was marked by Biden's extensive responses, while Charlamagne listened attentively, nodding as Biden walked through his biography and policy proposals.\n\nTwice, a Biden staffer attempted to end the interview, not for malicious reasons but due to a scheduling conflict with a virtual organizing event involving Jill Biden and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. The first interruption occurred at the 11-minute mark, but Biden continued the conversation for another six minutes. The second attempt to end the interview came at the 17-minute mark, just after Biden stated, \"I guarantee you, there are multiple black women being considered [for the vice presidency].\"\n\nFollowing the second staff intervention, Charlamagne asserted, \"You can't do that to black media.\" Biden responded, \"I got to do that to white media and black media because my wife has to go on at 6 o'clock.\" Glancing at his watch, Biden said, \"Uh oh! I'm in trouble,\" to which Charlamagne laughed and asked Biden to visit the Breakfast Club crew in New York, as November is still a long way off, and they have more questions.\n\nBiden's statement, \"You ain't black\" in this context, is a jest, reflecting his longstanding relationship with the African American community and his role as Vice President to the nation's first black president. The comment is better understood as an expression of exasperation, similar to questioning someone's blackness due to their lack of understanding of a cultural reference, rather than a dismissal of someone's black identity.\n\nIn the broader context of the interview, Biden's statement is a clear nod to the widespread belief among African Americans that President Trump and his policies are harmful to the health, safety, and well-being of the black community.\n\nLooking ahead, Charlamagne and Biden are expected to continue their dialogue, with Charlamagne pressing Biden on the crime bill and other issues affecting African Americans. Biden, in turn, will have another opportunity to engage with the black community and seek their support in the upcoming election.",

Miriam Adelson, a physician and drug addiction expert, was the top female donor, contributing approximately $46 million, primarily to Republican committees and super PACs. This was more than twice the combined contributions of the next 15 top female donors. Her husband, Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, donated $50 million.\n\nHowever, Miriam Adelson was not the one making headlines for her association with Mitt Romney, her public opposition to Obama administration policies, or her courtship by politicians. The lack of female megadonors is evident in a political landscape where wealthy men such as Charles and David Koch, Jeffrey Katzenberg, or Foster Friess hold significant influence. These men are the ones who are often pursued by the media and whose ideas shape the national conversation.\n\nSiobhan \u201cSam\u201d Bennett, president and CEO of the Women\u2019s Campaign Fund and a former Democratic congressional candidate, stated, \u201cIt would be naive to say that political giving doesn\u2019t influence what gets discussed and what gets talked about.\u201d Amber Mostyn, a Democratic megadonor and Houston trial lawyer, who donated $1.3 million to federal candidates and super PACs in the 2012 election, and thousands more to state-level candidates in Texas, agreed, stating that the lack of women donors \u201cabsolutely\u201d affects policy.\n\nThe reasons for this disparity are varied, with a relative lack of cash, distaste for the political process, and the decision to donate money elsewhere being common explanations. The result is a political landscape where women are not always as prominent as men, and this has an impact on the issues discussed during campaigns and the agenda in Congress.\n\nAccording to a review of Federal Election Commission reports and data from the Center for Responsive Politics, of the top 100 overall donors, 11 were women, contributing about 17% of the total amount given by those 100 donors. The discrepancy continues down the line, with women accounting for 28% of the top 31,000 donors, according to the Sunlight Foundation.\n\nThe numbers are based on contributions to campaigns, committees, and super PACs, and do not include contributions to 501(c)(4) nonprofits such as Americans for Prosperity that are not required to disclose donors. Although women hold far fewer high-level corporate jobs and board seats, donations from women to political causes, parties, and candidates have lagged behind men even when controlling for income.\n\nSusie Tomkins Buell, a Democratic megadonor associated with Democracy Alliance, attributes the lack of female donors to a lack of mentorship and support that men receive. However, once women are invited into the political sphere, they feel empowered and motivated to contribute.\n\nDr. Adelson was not immediately available to comment for this story. The disparity in political contributions between men and women remains a significant issue in American politics, with implications for the issues discussed during campaigns and the policies enacted in Congress.",
    " Title: U.S. Prosecutor Accuses Prince Andrew of Zero Cooperation in Jeffrey Epstein Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Britain's Prince Andrew has provided \"zero cooperation\" to the American investigators who want to interview him as part of their sex trafficking probe into Jeffrey Epstein, a U.S. prosecutor said Monday.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference outside Epstein's New York mansion, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said prosecutors and the FBI had contacted Andrew's lawyers and asked to interview him.\n\n\"To date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation,\" said Berman, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan.\n\nPrince Andrew announced last year that he was withdrawing from his royal duties amid renewed public attention on a woman's claim that she had several sexual encounters with the prince at Epstein's behest, starting when she was 17.\n\nVirginia Roberts Giuffre says that after meeting Epstein in Florida in 2000, the millionaire flew her around the world and pressured her into having sex with numerous older men, including Andrew, two senior U.S. politicians, a noted academic, wealthy financiers, and the attorney Alan Dershowitz, who is now part of President Donald Trump's impeachment defense team.\n\nAll of those men have denied the allegations. Epstein killed himself in his jail cell last summer while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\n\nGiuffre has said she had sex with Andrew three times, including once in London in 2001 at the home of Epstein's girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nIt isn't clear what legal exposure Andrew might have in the case, if any. The age of consent for sex is 16 in England and 17 in New York. However, Giuffre claims that she was paid by Epstein for her sexual encounters with Andrew. That could constitute a violation of U.S. sex trafficking laws if she was under age 18 or was coerced into unwanted sex acts.\n\nAndrew, who is eighth in line for the British throne, and Maxwell have both denied any knowledge that Epstein was sexually abusing teenage girls. In a TV interview last fall, Andrew insisted he was out having pizza with his children on the night Giuffre says they were together in London.\n\nU.S. Attorney General William Barr has vowed to aggressively investigate and bring charges against anyone who may have helped Epstein.\n\nAndrew, in the statement he released in November announcing his intention to \"step back from public duties,\" said he regretted his \"ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\n\"Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required,\" he wrote.\n\nBerman made his remarks about the case during a joint appearance with members of Safe Horizon, a nonprofit victim services agency, to discuss a new New York law that made it easier for people to sue over childhood sexual abuse.\n\nHe wouldn't discuss the Epstein investigation in detail but reiterated that the case didn't end with his death.\n\n\"Jeffrey Epstein couldn't have done what he did without the assistance of others, and I can assure you that the investigation is moving forward,\" Berman said.\n\nNumerous women who said they were sexually abused by Epstein as teenagers have claimed in lawsuits and interviews that he got help recruiting young girls from both Maxwell and several assistants.\n\nGiuffre's lawyers have, for months, been calling on Andrew to agree to be interviewed both by investigators and by the lawyers helping the women with those civil lawsuits.\n\nTo date, the only people besides Epstein who were charged in connection with the scandal are two jail guards who were supposed to be monitoring Epstein the night he was found dead. Both have been charged with falsifying the jail's log books to indicate they were performing checks on prisoners, when they were actually sleeping or browsing the internet.",
    " Title: White House Clarifies: President Obama to Pursue Assault Weapons Ban as Part of Gun Control Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nWashington ( CNN ) \u2013 Contrary to recent speculations, President Barack Obama will seek the passage of an assault weapons ban as part of a broader push for new gun control laws, a White House official confirmed on Friday.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, in his presentation of potential proposals under consideration by his gun task force on Thursday, did not mention the idea of an assault weapons ban. Instead, he focused on a new universal background check system for gun buyers and restrictions on high capacity magazines.\n\nThe omission led to speculation in news reports that the White House had dropped the consideration of a potential assault weapons ban. However, White House spokesman Matt Lehrich stated, \"Those reports are false.\" He added, \"The President has been clear that Congress should reinstate the assault weapons ban, and avoiding this issue just because it's been politically difficult in the past is not an option.\"\n\nOver the past week, Vice President Biden has been meeting with various stakeholders in the gun control debate. On Thursday, he held face-to-face discussions with the National Rifle Association and other gun owners' groups before conferring with representatives from the film and television industry.\n\nAdministration officials note that Biden's comments on Thursday were aimed at \"consensus\" proposals coming out of the task force meetings. An assault weapons ban would not fit that category.\n\nIn a sign of the White House's readiness to move aggressively on its proposals, Biden made his public comments just before meeting with the NRA. The gun lobby expressed disappointment in its discussion with the vice president and later released a statement accusing the administration of mounting \"an agenda to attack the Second Amendment.\"\n\nOrganizations advocating for tougher gun control laws insist an assault weapons ban is crucial to addressing the nation's recent spate of mass shootings. However, such a ban could face challenges in a gridlocked Congress.\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner stated it would be premature to comment on Vice President Biden's remarks. The Biden task force is expected to deliver its recommendations to the president on Tuesday.\n\n\"Once the President makes some recommendations, we'll take a look at them,\" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said.",
    " Title: Clinton and Kaine Criticize Trump's 100-Day Agenda, Emphasize Democratic Traditions in Pennsylvania Rally\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a campaign stop in Pittsburgh on Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, criticized Republican rival Donald Trump's focus on personal grievances over governing, as opposed to their own plans for the first 100 days in office.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the campaign plane, Mrs. Clinton and Sen. Kaine highlighted Mr. Trump's threat to sue his accusers after the election, a remark made during his speech at the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, earlier in the day.\n\n\"Our opponent, Donald Trump, went to Gettysburg, one of the most extraordinary places in American history,\" Mrs. Clinton said, \"and basically said if he's president, he will spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior.\"\n\nBy contrast, she said, \"Tim and I are going to keep talking about what we want to do if we're given the great honor of serving as president and vice president. We'll get to work the day after the election and do everything possible to be prepared on Jan. 20 to start doing the business of the American people.\"\n\nSen. Kaine, who was accompanying Mrs. Clinton to a late-night rally in Philadelphia, added that Mr. Trump \"seemed most personally invested in...all of the scores that he needs to settle with people he's mad at.\"\n\nThe pair had just come from a rally at a local high school in Pittsburgh. Both campaigns have made Pennsylvania a particular focus, with analysts believing that a Clinton victory in the state would cut off one possible path by which Mr. Trump could reach the needed threshold of 270 electoral votes.\n\nMrs. Clinton also touched on a theme she has emphasized in recent days: that Mr. Trump is a danger to America's democratic traditions. She has faulted him for saying during Wednesday's presidential debate that he might not concede the election in the event of a defeat.\n\n\"Failing to accept election results, however disappointing, is the difference between 'leadership and dictatorship,' Mrs. Clinton said Saturday, adding that Mr. Trump shows a troubling disregard for constitutional freedoms and protections.\"\n\nShe also referred to the GOP presidential nominee's contention that she should be jailed for using a private email system while she was secretary of state.\n\n\"Every time he says he wants to jail his opponent\u2014meaning me\u2014I think to myself, 'We don't do that in America. We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary,'\" she said.\n\nMrs. Clinton spent part of her 37-minute address making a case for Democratic Senate candidate Katie McGinty, who is challenging incumbent Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey. Democrats believe Mr. Toomey's defeat is central to retaking control of the Senate and providing Mrs. Clinton with a friendlier Congress should she win in November. Mr. Toomey leads by about two points in the Real Clear Politics average of polls.\n\nIn devoting time to Ms. McGinty's campaign, Mrs. Clinton showed she is thinking about down-ballot races that would affect her policy agenda should she win on Nov. 8.\n\n\"Katie will help us break through the gridlock\u2014actually make a difference in people's lives,\" Mrs. Clinton said.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Block Unanimous Passage of Additional Small Business Aid Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events at the U.S. Senate, Senate Democrats on Thursday blocked a Republican push to unanimously pass a bill to provide an additional $250 billion for a loan program aimed at small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The move came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) attempted to approve the measure by a unanimous vote, with only a few senators present in the Capitol.\n\nSen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) objected to the request, stalling the legislation. In response, McConnell labeled the move as a \"political stunt.\" Cardin, however, pushed for provisions including money for Small Business Administration disaster assistance grants to help those without a banking relationship receive aid.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) then attempted to unanimously pass a Democratic amendment, which McConnell blocked, leading to the Senate's adjournment until Monday after a brief 30-minute pro forma session.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has indicated she could try to pass a Democratic bill on Friday, a move that Republicans can likely block with most representatives out of Washington. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had earlier asked for an emergency bill to include $250 billion for hospitals, health systems, state and local governments, and food assistance programs, in addition to money for small companies.\n\nHowever, Pelosi stated that she only wanted $125 billion for the existing program specifically, and another $125 billion for community-based lenders and SBA disaster assistance loans and grants. The Democrats also expressed concerns about the program's eligibility criteria and its potential impact on rural business owners, farmers, and small firms not currently working with a bank participating in the program.\n\nMcConnell contended that Democrats did not need to attach other emergency funding measures to the small business plan. He argued, \"Nobody believes this is the Senate's last word on COVID-19. We don't have to do everything right now.\" The Trump administration has cited strong demand for the loans as the reason for requesting additional funding for the program.",
    " Title: Ezra Klein's \"Why We're Polarized\": A Comprehensive Analysis of American Political Polarization and the Role of Technology\n\nIn a thought-provoking conversation, journalist and author Ezra Klein, editor-at-large at Vox and host of The Ezra Klein Show podcast, discusses his new book, \"Why We're Polarized.\" The book delves into the historical context of American political polarization and argues that the country has become significantly more polarized over the past 50 years.\n\nDuring the interview, Nicholas Thompson, the editor of Wired, praised Klein's book, stating that it offers a compelling narrative that traces the roots of polarization back to the sorting of political coalitions by ideology, race, religion, geography, psychology, consumer behavior, and cultural preferences. Thompson also noted the timely release of the book, coinciding with the impeachment hearings, which were marked by unprecedented partisanship.\n\nKlein clarified that while social media plays a role in exacerbating polarization, it is not the primary cause. He explained that the core story of the book is the feedback loop created by the sorting of political institutions and actors, which further polarizes the audience, and vice versa. Social media, according to Klein, is one of these institutions, but the bulk of the increase in American party polarization predates social media.\n\nThompson expressed concerns about the potential impact of this feedback loop on the media industry, citing the example of a newspaper that is critical of a particular political figure, which would primarily attract critics of that figure, leading to more polarized content and increased page views.\n\nKlein agreed with Thompson's assessment, highlighting two main problems caused by this kind of polarization. The first is the constant state of anger and agitation that characterizes politics, making it an unappealing prospect for those who prefer a less contentious political environment. The second, and more significant problem, according to Klein, is the interaction between polarization and political institutions, which require high levels of compromise to function effectively. With parties as polarized as they are, bipartisanship becomes irrational for the out-of-power party to offer, leading to a system where everyone is fighting, but problems are not being resolved.\n\nIn essence, Klein's book, \"Why We're Polarized,\" offers a nuanced exploration of the complexities of American political polarization, shedding light on the historical, cultural, and institutional factors that have contributed to this phenomenon, and the role that technology, including social media, plays in this process.",
    " Title: Obama Launches Nationwide Campaign to Promote Health Care Enrollment Under Affordable Care Act\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Obama is embarking on a nationwide campaign this summer to promote enrollment in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The White House aims to reach all 50 states, as well as Washington D.C., in an effort to ensure the success of the health care law.\n\nThe ACA has faced numerous challenges since its inception, including contentious votes in Congress and a Supreme Court ruling upholding the law. Now, the administration faces a significant hurdle: convincing uninsured individuals to purchase health care when enrollment begins on October 1.\n\nDuring his commencement address at Morehouse College this month, President Obama urged graduates to sign up for health insurance this fall. He emphasized the importance of universal health coverage, stating, \"We've got to make sure everybody has good health in this country. It's not just good for you, it's good for this country. So you're going to have to spread the word to your fellow young people.\"\n\nDavid Simas, deputy senior adviser to the president, oversees the implementation of universal health coverage from a windowless basement office in the West Wing. The administration aims to enroll 7 million people across the country in the first year, a goal that Simas says will require a multi-faceted approach, including television ads, door-to-door canvassing, and extensive use of social media and earned media.\n\nThe administration is also developing an Expedia-style website to make the enrollment process as user-friendly as possible. However, attracting people to the website is a significant challenge, as a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll revealed that 4 in 10 Americans are unaware that the health care law is still in effect.\n\nNancy-Ann DeParle, who has worked on this issue for years, including as Obama's deputy chief of staff, is not concerned about the lack of awareness. She believes that people were not paying attention until now, as there was so much other news to consume.\n\nHowever, the administration's efforts have already faced obstacles. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has requested additional funding from Congress to implement Obamacare, but Republicans have consistently refused and have voted to repeal the law. Without the requested funding, Sebelius attempted to fundraise for an independent group called Enroll America, which focuses on implementing Obamacare. This move has sparked controversy, with Republicans accusing Sebelius of bypassing Congress by soliciting private donations.\n\nTwo Republican-controlled House committees are now investigating the solicitations, and some health care companies have expressed reluctance about donating to Enroll America due to potential political backlash. This could make it more difficult to reach the target audience and ensure the success of the enrollment campaign.\n\nAnother crucial aspect of the campaign is attracting young and healthy individuals, who may not require much medical care, to balance out the pool and ensure the financial sustainability of the system. With the enrollment date fast approaching, administration officials will likely continue to emphasize the importance of health coverage during commencement speeches and other events.",
    " Title: House Republicans Resist Senate's Call for IRS Tax Enforcement Measures\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift from previous years, House Republicans are resisting calls to strengthen the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in its efforts to combat tax evasion. This resistance is evident in their rejection of several Senate proposals aimed at addressing tax cheats, overstated mortgage interest deductions, and incorrect child tax credit claims.\n\nThis stance represents a stark contrast to the past, when Republicans, in collaboration with the IRS, had initiated measures to clamp down on tax shelters and foreign banks aiding Americans in hiding income abroad. However, this was before the May 2013 Inspector General report, which criticized the IRS for excessively scrutinizing tea party groups seeking tax-exempt status.\n\nRepresentative Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio), a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, expressed skepticism about granting the IRS more authority, stating, \"There\u2019s not a whole lot of confidence right now about what the Internal Revenue Service does among the American people, let alone members of Congress. Why should we give them more tools to harass taxpayers?\"\n\nPolitical considerations also play a role in this resistance. Cracking down on tax evasion could conflict with the House Republicans' campaign message for the upcoming election year, according to Floyd Williams, the IRS's former director of legislative affairs.\n\nThe disagreement not only jeopardizes the collection of the estimated $400 billion in unpaid taxes annually, but it also threatens unrelated legislation. A highway budget bill, including several of the proposed provisions, is set to expire in the Senate this week due to House Republican opposition. Another Senate measure offering tax cuts to startup companies, small businesses, and certain industries is also at risk.\n\nThe House Republicans' stance puts them at odds with Senate Republicans, who have traditionally been less zealous in their pursuit of the IRS. Senator John Thune (R-SD), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, expressed support for tax collection but noted, \"It\u2019s just a function of enforcing the law.\"\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) criticized the House Republicans' stance, stating, \"This has been a traditional position supported by both sides of the aisle. Certainly, this is a departure that needs to be addressed.\"\n\nBefore the tea party scandal, lawmakers had agreed to raise tens of billions of dollars by improving tax collections, often relying on third-party corroboration to detect errors and ensure accuracy in tax returns. However, this resistance from House Republicans could potentially disrupt this bipartisan cooperation.",
    " Title: ISIS Claims Responsibility for Killing of Aid Worker Peter Kassig, Releases Graphic Video\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a chilling development, the Islamic State group has released a video on Sunday, allegedly showing the beheading of a dozen Syrian soldiers and the execution of American aid worker Peter Kassig. The video, posted on websites known to be used by ISIS, ends with a militant standing over a severed head he claims to be that of Kassig.\n\nThe White House confirmed Kassig's death on Sunday afternoon. President Barack Obama, in a statement, called the killing an \"act of pure evil by a terrorist group that the world rightly associates with inhumanity.\" He described ISIS as a group that \"revels in the slaughter of innocents, including Muslims, and is bent only on sowing death and destruction.\"\n\nThe victim's parents, Ed and Paula Kassig, expressed their grief in a statement posted on Twitter. \"We are heartbroken to learn that our son, Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig, has lost his life as a result of his love for the Syrian people and his desire to ease their suffering,\" they said.\n\nThe high-definition video shows the beheadings of about a dozen men identified as Syrian military officers and pilots, all dressed in blue jumpsuits. The video was filmed in Dabiq, a town in northern Syria that ISIS uses as the title of its English-language propaganda magazine and where they believe an apocalyptic battle between Muslims and their enemies will occur.\n\nThe militant who speaks in the video has a British accent and warns that U.S. soldiers will meet a similar fate. \"We say to you, Obama:... You claim to have withdrawn from Iraq four years ago,\" the militant said. \"Here you are: You have not withdrawn. Rather, you hid some of your forces behind your proxies.\"\n\nA U.S.-led coalition is targeting the Islamic State group in airstrikes, supporting Western-backed Syrian rebels, Kurdish fighters, and the Iraqi military. The militant's voice is distorted in the video. Previous videos featured a militant with a British accent that the FBI says it has identified, though it has not named him publicly.\n\nLater in the video, the militant claims Kassig, 26, was killed because he \"fought against the Muslims in Iraq while serving as a soldier.\" Kassig, from Indianapolis, Indiana, served in the U.S. Army's 75th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit, and deployed to Iraq in 2007. After being medically discharged, Kassig formed the aid organization Special Emergency Response and Assistance (SERA) in Turkey to aid Syrian refugees. He delivered food and medical supplies and provided trauma care to wounded Syrian civilians before being captured in eastern Syria last year. Friends say he converted to Islam in captivity and took the first name Abdul-Rahman.\n\nBurhan Agha, a Syrian friend who worked with Kassig in Lebanon and who moved to Switzerland seeking asylum, wept when recounting his generosity on Sunday. \"If I could apologize to each American, one by one, I would, because Peter died in Syria, while he was helping the Syrian people,\" Agha told the AP by telephone. \"Those who killed him claimed to have done it in the name of Islam. I am a Muslim and am from Syria.... (His killers) are not Muslims.\"\n\nThe White House said the U.S. intelligence community was examining the video. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said that if the video is authentic, the White House would be \"appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron said he was \"horrified by the cold-blooded murder.\" He described the Islamic State group as having \"again shown their depravity.\" Previous videos have shown the beheading of two American journalists and two British aid workers. The latest video did not show the person identified as Kassig being beheaded. Unlike previous videos, it did not show other Western captives or directly threaten to behead anyone else. It also had lingering close-ups on some militants' exposed faces, with a few appearing to be foreigners.\n\nThe Islamic State group holds British photojournalist John Cantlie, who has appeared in several videos delivering statements for the group, likely under duress. They also hold a 26-year-old American woman captured last year in Syria while working for aid groups. U.S. officials have asked that the woman not be identified out of fears for her safety.\n\nThe Islamic State group has beheaded and shot dead hundreds of captives\u2014mainly Syrian and Iraqi soldiers\u2014during its sweep across the two countries, and has celebrated its mass killings in extremely graphic videos. The group has declared a self-styled Islamic caliphate in the areas under its control, which it governs according to its violent interpretation of Shariah law.\n\nOn Sunday, the Islamic State group claimed a bombing at the Baghdad International Airport that wounded five people, saying it was trying to strike Americans there. No one was wounded in a passing United Nations convoy, the organization said.\n\nThe Islamic State group has its roots in al-Qaida's Iraqi affiliate but was expelled from the global terror network over its brutal tactics and refusal to obey orders to confine its activities to Iraq. It became even more extreme amid the bloody civil war in neighboring Syria and grew strong enough to launch a lightning offensive across Iraq. Syria's war began as an uprising against President Bashar Assad. Activists say that conflict has killed more than 200,000 people.",
    " Title: House Democrats Release Trove of Documents from Lev Parnas, Including Handwritten Note on Biden Investigation\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 House Democrats have released a trove of documents obtained from Lev Parnas, a close associate of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, including a handwritten note that mentions asking Ukraine's president to investigate \"the Biden case.\"\n\nThe documents, obtained as part of the impeachment investigation, show Parnas communicating with Giuliani before the removal of Marie Yovanovitch, who was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. A man named Robert F. Hyde disparaged Yovanovitch in messages to Parnas and gave him updates on her location and cell phone use, raising questions about possible surveillance.\n\nDemocrats released the files Tuesday as they prepared to send articles of impeachment to the Senate for Trump's trial. The documents add new context to their charges that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Democrats as he withheld military aid.\n\nParnas was in frequent communication with Giuliani and with Ukrainian officials, the messages show. He appeared to be pushing unsubstantiated allegations that Democrat Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, were somehow engaged in corruption in Ukraine.\n\nAmong the documents is a handwritten note on stationery from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Vienna that says \"get Zelensky to Annonce that the Biden case will be Investigated.\" Trump asked Zelensky in a July call to investigate his political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a gas company based in Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats said that Parnas' attorney confirmed that Parnas wrote the notes.\n\nThe documents \u2014 including phone records, texts, and flash drives turned over by Parnas \u2014 were sent to the House Judiciary Committee by three other House panels \"to be included as part of the official record that will be transmitted to the Senate along with the Articles of Impeachment,\" according to a statement. Some of the materials were made public while others were marked as sensitive.\n\nParnas and his business partner, Igor Fruman, both U.S. citizens who emigrated from the former Soviet bloc, were indicted last year on charges of conspiracy, making false statements, and falsification of records. Prosecutors allege they made outsize campaign donations to Republican causes after receiving millions of dollars originating from Russia. The men have pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn several of the documents, Parnas communicated with Giuliani about the removal of Yovanovitch. The ambassador's ouster, ordered by Trump, was at the center of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry. Yovanovitch testified in the House impeachment hearings that she was the victim of a \"smear campaign.\"\n\nTrump, on a July 25 call, had promised Zelensky that Yovanovitch was \"going to go through some things.\" Roughly two months earlier, she was recalled from her diplomatic post.\n\nOn April 23, just before Yovanovitch was directed to return to the United States, Giuliani texted Parnas, \"He fired her again.\" Parnas texted back, \"I pray it happens this time I'll call you tomorrow, my brother.\"\n\nParnas also received messages from Hyde, who referred to Yovanovitch as a \"bitch.\" Hyde is now running for a U.S. House seat in Connecticut.\n\nAfter texting about the ambassador, Hyde gave Parnas detailed updates that suggested he was watching her. In one text, Hyde wrote: \"She's talked to three people. Her phone is off. Her computer is off.\" He said she was under heavy security and \"we have a person inside.\"\n\nHyde at one point texted Parnas that \"they are willing to help if we/you would like a price,\" and \"guess you can do anything in Ukraine with money... is what I was told.\"\n\nLawrence Robbins, an attorney for Yovanovitch, called for an investigation into the messages.\n\n\"Needless to say, the notion that American citizens and others were monitoring Ambassador Yovanovitch's movements for unknown purposes is disturbing,\" Robbins said. \"We trust that the appropriate authorities will conduct an investigation to determine what happened.\"\n\nOn Twitter, Hyde dismissed the claims as \"laughable\" and appeared to try to distance himself from Parnas. He said he would \"welcome\" an investigation.\n\nThe text messages show that Parnas consulted Giuliani in January 2019 after the U.S. denied a visa for former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. Giuliani replied: \"I can revive it.\"\n\nThe following day, Giuliani told Parnas: \"It's going to work. I have no 1 in it.\" Giuliani then predicted \"he will get one\" before giving Parnas the phone number for Jay Sekulow, the leader of the president's personal legal team. Sekulow is expected to be part of Trump's legal team during the impeachment trial.\n\nA federal judge earlier this month ruled that Parnas could provide the materials to Congress as part of the impeachment proceedings.\n\nDemocrats voted in December to impeach Trump for abuse of power and for obstruction of Congress.",
    " Title: Romney Promises Opposite Approach on Israel, Takes Pennsylvania Tour Off-Course Amidst Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a speech to religious conservatives via video uplink on Saturday, Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, pledged to adopt an opposite approach to President Barack Obama's policy on Israel. The former Massachusetts governor, who is currently on a five-day, six-state bus tour, found his itinerary disrupted in Pennsylvania, a battleground state he aims to win in the fall.\n\nRomney, who spent most of the day campaigning in Pennsylvania, told a cheering crowd in Cornwall, a small town in the state's center, that he would win Pennsylvania. However, his campaign bus tour was diverted from its original route due to Democratic efforts.\n\nIn his address to the Faith and Freedom Coalition in Washington, Romney criticized Obama for appearing more concerned about Israel attacking Iran than about Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. This was the first time Romney had discussed Israel's policy at length since becoming the likely Republican presidential nominee.\n\n\"I think, by and large, you can just look at the things the president has done and do the opposite,\" Romney said when asked about Israel. He spoke to the gathering of religious conservatives from Weatherly, Pa., via video uplink with his campaign bus in the background.\n\nDemocrats accused Romney of distorting Obama's record on Israel. Spokesman Ben LaBolt said Obama had given Israel more security assistance than any other administration and had stood with Israel at the United Nations.\n\nAfter his address, Romney's bus was rerouted to Quakertown due to Democratic protests. Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell and several other Democratic officials held a press conference outside the Wawa gas station where Romney had planned an early afternoon stop. Protestors gathered outside the store.\n\nRomney decided to visit a different Wawa store instead. \"Why we're at this Wawa, instead of the other Wawa? I understand I had a surrogate over there already, so we decided to pick a different place. My surrogate is former Gov. Rendell, who said we could win Pennsylvania,\" Romney said as he paid for a meatball hoagie.\n\nThe detour disrupted Romney's jobs-and-economy message he had been pushing earlier in the day. Romney later appeared at Weatherly Casting and Machine Co., where he spoke about the need for a \"very careful review\" of who is giving a fair shot to the American people.\n\nRomney's bus tour represents a new mode for him in the general election. During the primary, Romney sometimes ran into trouble in less-scripted environments, and the bus tour will likely test him again. Romney also took time to do an interview for CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" program and discussed the president's decision to allow some young illegal immigrants to stay in the country instead of deporting them.\n\nRomney's efforts to connect with average people were evident during his campaign stop in Cornwall, where he learned the Pennsylvania term for submarine sandwiches\u2014hoagies\u2014and noted the intra-state rivalry between Wawa and Sheetz, another convenience store popular in the western part of the state.",
    " Title: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Ivanka Trump's Exchange Over Chicago's Gun Violence Issue\n\nArticle:\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Presidential Adviser Ivanka Trump have engaged in a public exchange over Twitter, with Trump highlighting the city's gun violence problem following the mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas.\n\nIn response to the recent mass shootings, Trump tweeted about the violence in Chicago, stating, \"As we grieve over the evil mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, let us not overlook that Chicago experienced its deadliest weekend of the year, with 7 dead and 52 wounded near a playground in the Windy City.\"\n\nMayor Lightfoot responded to Trump's tweets on Tuesday, stating that they were \"misleading\" and that Trump does not have a clear understanding of the situation.\n\n\"It wasn't a playground, it was a park. It wasn't seven dead. It wasn't 52 wounded in one incident, which is what this suggests. It's misleading,\" Lightfoot said, as reported by the Chicago Tribune. \"It's important when we're talking about people's lives to actually get the facts correct, which one can easily do if you actually cared about getting it right.\"\n\nLightfoot added that she is focused on running the city of Chicago and working hard to keep its citizens safe. \"I'm not going to be distracted by nonsense tweets from people who don't know what they're talking about,\" she said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Trump issued a statement reiterating that Chicago had experienced \"one of the deadliest weekends\" this year and that Trump's \"point remains the same\" about inner-city violence. The statement also noted that there were 7 deaths and 52 wounded across the city, resulting in one of the deadliest weekends in the city this year.\n\nMayor Lightfoot and Ivanka Trump met in Washington in May to discuss workforce development and criminal justice reform, as reported by the Chicago Tribune.",
    " Title: Analogies Drawn Between Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore and George Wallace: A Comparative Analysis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing political race for the Alabama Senate seat, history professor at Jacksonville State University, Gordon Harvey, has noted a striking resemblance between the campaign strategies of candidate Roy Moore and the late George Wallace, the former Alabama governor known for his staunch segregationist views.\n\nWhile Moore has not made overtly incendiary statements akin to Wallace, he has employed a political tactic reminiscent of the past, as evidenced by a mailer featuring an African-American that read, \"Think if a black man went after high school girls, anyone would try to make him a senator?\" This tactic, according to Moore's opponent, Doug Jones, has stirred volatile elements in the political landscape.\n\nJones, in an interview, stated, \"I've never seen so many volatile elements packed into a political moment.\" He then paused, reflecting on the parallels between the current political climate and the era of Wallace.\n\nWallace, the fiery segregationist governor, is a name that echoes frequently in today's discourse. He was a boxer, a circuit judge with lofty ambitions, a state leader who defied federal authority, a symbol of defiance to the national culture, a hero to many rural and small-town whites, and a politician who ran national campaigns on a promise to \"send them a message.\" These descriptions resonate strongly with Moore's political persona.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that Wallace was a Democrat, and his use of race was far more overt and central. When political veterans are asked to draw comparative races, they often refer to Wallace's successful 1970 run for governor, where he took on an \"unholy coalition\" of the Republican and Democratic national parties, militant blacks, and country club millionaires. This coalition, aside from the White House, is similar to the crowd that Moore has taken on, at least since President Trump endorsed his candidacy.\n\nDespite the similarities in their delivery, those who knew Wallace well are quick to point out that the messengers are not alike. The messages may be delivered in the same style, but the context, the intentions, and the historical background of the two individuals are distinct.",
    " Title: Obama Defends Syria Response, Criticizes Washington's Focus on Style Over Substance\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview with ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday, President Barack Obama defended his handling of the Syria crisis, stating that the political climate in Washington is more concerned with style than substance.\n\n\"Folks here in Washington like to grade on style,\" Obama said, \"Had we rolled out something that was very smooth and disciplined and linear, they would have graded it well, even if it was a disastrous policy. We know that because that's exactly how they graded the Iraq War until it ended up blowing [up] in our face.\"\n\nThe president has faced criticism since last summer when he declared that Syrian President Bashar Assad would \"cross a red line\" if chemical weapons were used in Syria's two-year-long civil war. The criticism intensified last month when Obama stated that the United States should launch a punitive military strike against Assad for using sarin gas in an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack that killed nearly 1,500 Syrians, but first wanted congressional approval.\n\nHowever, Congress, the American public, and other world leaders showed little interest in a military strike, which led to potential diplomatic solutions, the origins of which remain unclear.\n\nOne of the sharpest critics has been Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"It's like watching a caged dog,\" Corker said recently. \"Words like ad-hoc, improvised, unsteady come to mind.\"\n\nObama, now in his second term, acknowledged he is used to such criticism. \"I'm less concerned about style points. I'm much more concerned about getting the policy right,\" he said in a wide-ranging interview in which he also talked about Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon and criticized House Republicans' approach to fiscal negotiations, including an upcoming talk on increasing the federal debt limit.\n\nObama said the United States' approach to Syria should show Iran that there's the potential for diplomatic solutions to arms standoffs. However, he also said Iran should not assume that his preference for diplomacy means the U.S. won't strike Tehran.\n\nObama said Iranians understand that their pursuit of a nuclear weapon is \"a far larger issue for us\" than the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The president also said he has exchanged letters with Iran's new president, but the two have not spoken directly. Obama said he believes Iranian President Hasan Rouhani understands the potential for a diplomatic solution to his country's disputed nuclear program but will not \"suddenly make it easy.\"",
    " Title: Navigating Etiquette in a Pandemic: A Guide to Courteous Living in New York City\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, New Yorkers are finding themselves in uncharted territory, grappling with new tensions and stressors even in the most mundane activities. As essential workers continue to keep the city running, the need for basic rules of behavior to make quarantine life more bearable has become increasingly important.\n\nThe New York Post spoke with therapists, professional shoppers, and other experts to compile a guide to courteous living during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen it comes to grocery shopping, Tim Hickey, an Instacart shopper from Staten Island, advises limiting the number of people in your party and following the store's guidelines if they are available. Wearing a mask is also crucial, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nHeavy items like cases of water bottles or large bags of rice from Costco should be avoided when getting groceries delivered, as they are hard to carry and make professional shoppers less likely to select your order. Delivery people prefer no-contact deliveries, so it's best to leave specific instructions in the app or contact your driver regarding the placement of your groceries.\n\nTipping within the app is recommended, as drivers don't want to handle cash or enter your home. Most customers have been tipping more than 20 percent, according to Hickey.\n\nOn the streets, maintaining personal space is essential. While New Yorkers are known for their close quarters, it's crucial to be mindful of how much room you're taking up on the sidewalk. Step aside when around strangers and make sure you're staying 6 feet apart.\n\nWorking from home should not change your behavior significantly, according to Maggie Craddock, founder of Workplace Relationships. If you wouldn't alert your team if you were stepping out for 20 minutes in an office setting, there's no need to do so now.\n\nVideoconference calls have become the norm, but they should be used wisely. Ask your team if they'd prefer to do a call over video or by phone, as everyone's moods are fluid right now.\n\nBeing kind to your teammates and yourself is essential during this time. If you're feeling burnt out or dealing with a personal problem, be honest about it and ask for assistance.\n\nIf you're living with someone who isn't taking social distancing seriously, be direct and insist on the importance of following guidelines. Compromise is key in other situations, but when it comes to social distancing, it's non-negotiable.\n\nRandom video calls with friends have become the norm, and it's essential to be direct with your loved ones if you're not comfortable with these calls. Checking in with friends about their preferences regarding calls or video chats is also important.\n\nEnding calls gracefully can be challenging, but using household obligations as a point to say goodbye can make those transitions smoother.\n\nIn these trying times, it's essential to be mindful of our behavior and the impact it has on those around us. By following these guidelines, we can help make quarantine life more bearable for everyone.",
    " Title: The Unpredictable 2016 Presidential Race: A Look at the Current Political Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 2016 presidential race is proving to be an unpredictable and entertaining spectacle, with several high-profile figures considering a run and established candidates grappling with their identities and campaign strategies.\n\nMitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, is reportedly contemplating a return to the political arena, potentially attracting some of Jeb Bush's supporters who are seeking a new candidate to back. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's campaign continues to garner respectful attention, but the question of what to call her if she were to be elected remains a topic of debate. Suggestions such as \"Madame President,\" \"Mrs. President,\" and \"Miss President\" have been met with mixed reactions.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, known for his gaffes and extravagant slips, is also a contender. His recent suggestion that gun owners should take their shotguns to the front porch and blast away at night has sparked controversy. The Republican establishment, on the other hand, is grappling with taking Donald Trump seriously, as he continues to lead in the polls.\n\nTrump, who has been labeled an \"outlier\" or \"outsider,\" has been attracting large crowds, despite the liberal media's criticism of his rallies. For instance, his recent rally in Mobile, Alabama, which drew \"only\" 20,000 fans to a stadium seating 30,000, was met with criticism, but it was a larger turnout than any other candidate has managed so far.\n\nPresident Obama added a new twist to the race on Monday, hinting that he might endorse a candidate in the Democratic primaries, and it doesn't seem to be Hillary Clinton. In an interview, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest suggested that the president thinks Joe Biden would make a strong candidate, citing his experience and understanding of what is required to mount a successful national presidential campaign.\n\nThe potential endorsement of Obama could be valuable in a Democratic primary, signaling that the candidate will protect the president's legacy. However, in the general election, an Obama endorsement might be seen as a sloppy kiss of death, as voters may view the president as a political anomaly.\n\nThe 2016 presidential race is a testament to the changing political landscape, with the rise of cable-TV, the Internet, and a shift in the political preferences of the Republican grass roots. This grass roots minority, though a minority of a minority, is vocal, angry, and demanding. The outcome of the race remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the 2016 presidential race is anything but boring.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Call for OPM Director's Resignation as Data Breach Fallout Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of a massive data breach that potentially affected as many as 32 million Americans, lawmakers are calling for the resignation of Katherine Archuleta, the director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The pressure on President Obama to remove Archuleta from her position has intensified as the OPM's handling of the cybersecurity incident has come under scrutiny.\n\nDuring a hearing on Wednesday, Archuleta faced tough questions from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, with Chairman Jason Chaffetz (Utah Republican) stating, \"I think you\u2019re part of the problem. I think if you want different results, we\u2019re going to have to have different people.\"\n\nArchuleta, who is likely a victim of the breach herself, defended her position but struggled to answer direct questions, leading to criticism from key lawmakers. OPM Chief Information Officer Donna K. Seymour was also targeted, with Chaffetz telling her, \"You\u2019re in over your head.\"\n\nThe hearing followed a report by a cybersecurity firm that revealed federal employees' login and password information was widely available on the internet, with dozens of agencies potentially vulnerable to the same type of hack that hit the OPM. The OPM has acknowledged two breaches: one that stole personal information from about 4.2 million current and former federal employees, and a second breach that gave hackers access to the background check system, potentially exposing the most sensitive information of millions of Americans who have filled out the government's background check packet.\n\nArchuleta refused to disclose the total number of people affected by the data breaches, citing ongoing investigations. Although the OPM has calculated that 4.2 million people had data stolen in one breach, officials cannot determine how many had information stolen in the more intrusive hack of federal background check systems.\n\nThe White House has maintained its support for Archuleta, but Congress has expressed growing frustration with her performance. At the hearing, Archuleta presented a cybersecurity plan that included hiring a cybersecurity adviser by August 1 and learning best practices from industry leaders. The OPM has also implemented a modernization plan to update its systems.\n\nHowever, the OPM's inspector general, Patrick McFarland, expressed major concerns with Archuleta's staff's approach and predicted the costs of the data breach response would far exceed the $93 million the OPM has projected. McFarland also criticized the OPM for being secretive and withholding information from its own watchdog, delaying answers and providing nondefinitive responses.\n\nCriticism also extended to some of the contractors that work with the OPM and suffered their own breaches, including U.S. Investigations Services and Keypoint Government Solutions. The OPM's handling of the data breach has raised questions about the agency's ability to protect sensitive information and has sparked calls for a thorough overhaul of its cybersecurity practices.",
    " Title: Potential Latino Vice Presidential Candidates for Mitt Romney: Beyond Marco Rubio\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing race for the White House, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is reportedly considering a diverse range of potential vice presidential picks, with a focus on Latino candidates. Beyond Sen. Marco Rubio, other notable Hispanic politicians are generating buzz, including Govs. Susanna Martinez of New Mexico and Brian Sandoval of Nevada.\n\nAt the Council on Foreign Relations this week, Sen. Rubio spoke about the international hotspot of Syria, emphasizing the need for immediate action. \"It's time to act now. I don't want to score political points on this issue; I want to see it resolved,\" Rubio told Time Magazine's Rick Stengel, the event's moderator. However, every move Rubio makes is viewed through the lens of a potential vice presidential pick for Mitt Romney.\n\nFor many Republicans, Rubio is an attractive choice: a fresh-faced, telegenic tea party favorite from Florida, a key battleground state. He is also Hispanic, a fast-growing ethnic group in the United States, a group that Democrats have historically dominated in presidential elections over the past four decades. In 2008, only 31% of Latinos voted for Sen. John McCain, while nearly 7 in 10 voted for then-Sen. Barack Obama.\n\nIf Romney were to pick a Latino running mate, it could potentially bridge the huge gap between the Republican party and the Hispanic community. \"Republicans need about 40% of the Hispanic vote to be competitive nationally,\" said GOP strategist Leslie Sanchez. \"To add a candidate who happens to be of Hispanic descent is incredibly important, not only because it shows the party can be inclusive, but open-minded Latino independent voters will really see this is a reason to take a second look at the Republican party.\"\n\nTwo other Hispanic Republicans generating vice presidential buzz are New Mexico Gov. Susanna Martinez and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval. Martinez, the first Latina governor in U.S. history, is a gun-toting conservative but has clashed with fellow Hispanics in New Mexico due to her stance on drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants. Sandoval, a budget-cutting, government-shrinking Republican, favors abortion rights, which could be a drawback as a GOP running mate. He also does not speak Spanish.\n\nAlberto Gonzales, the first Latino U.S. attorney general, suggests that a Hispanic at the top of the ticket may help lure Latino voters, but not a vice president. \"I don't think it would make that much of a difference,\" Gonzales told CNN. Experience is key, Gonzales said, and all three candidates - Rubio, Martinez, and Sandoval - were elected to their posts less than 18 months ago.\n\nOne challenge in picking a Latino running mate is the diversity within the Hispanic-American community. Rubio is Cuban-American, while Martinez is Mexican-American. This poses risks for potential culture clashes, as two-thirds of Hispanics in the United States are of Mexican descent, and a much smaller percentage, about 4%, are Cuban.\n\nSome Latino politicians and strategists argue that Hispanics are a natural constituency for the GOP, not the Democratic party. Many Latino voters tend to be fiscally and socially conservative. However, the source of the decades-old GOP problem among Hispanic voters is historically limited outreach. That has changed in recent years, but the fight over immigration reform, which many Hispanic voters perceive as anti-Latino, has hampered efforts.\n\nWhile GOP Hispanics such as Gonzales and Sanchez disagree over whether a Latino running mate would really help Romney with Latino voters, they do agree it would be, when it comes to inclusiveness, an extremely important gesture. And it may help Republicans with Latinos in the long run. \"If Governor Romney makes a decision that one of the people you mentioned should be with him on the ticket, and if Governor Romney were to win in November, I mean there would be a great deal of pride in the Hispanic community in having that person being in that position,\" said Gonzales.",
    " Title: Senate Confirmation Hurdles for Mike Pompeo: A Raw Power Play or a Sign of Things to Come?\n\nArticle:\n\nThe confirmation process for Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State is facing obstacles not based on his qualifications, but rather as a result of a power struggle to deny President Trump a top cabinet position. The former CIA Director, who is widely regarded as competent, experienced, and highly credentialed, is facing opposition from some Democratic senators over personal and political issues.\n\nSenator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, has expressed her opposition to Pompeo's nomination, citing his stance on gay marriage and abortion rights. However, her decision to withhold support has caused controversy, as she previously supported Pompeo's nomination as CIA Director. This has led to speculation that the foreign-relations committee, for the first time ever, will not endorse a secretary of state nominee.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate's ability to govern is being challenged by the actions of Steve Bannon and Rand Paul. Bannon, a key advisor to President Trump, backed Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race, reducing the Republican majority to 51-49. The absence of John McCain due to illness further reduces the GOP margin. Rand Paul, known for his hardline stance on budgetary matters and foreign affairs, has been a consistent opponent of Pompeo.\n\nAnother Republican, Jeff Flake of Arizona, has hinted at opposing Pompeo over travel restrictions to Cuba. While Flake's stance on Cuba is not shared by all, the issue is not significant enough to block a secretary of state nomination, especially given the ongoing mystery surrounding the damaging sound attacks on embassy employees in Havana.\n\nThe good news is that Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, has come out in favor of Pompeo's nomination. More red-state Democrats are expected to follow suit. Despite this, the confirmation vote is expected to be historically narrow, a reflection of the intense opposition to Trump among Democrats and a potential sign of things to come if Democrats take back the Senate in 2018.",
    " Title: Senate Averts Government Shutdown, Passes Spending Bill and Water Projects Package\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, the U.S. Senate managed to pass a stopgap spending bill on Friday, averting a potential government shutdown just hours before the deadline. The bill, which keeps federal agencies running until April 28, also includes a water projects package and disaster relief funds.\n\nThe spending bill, known as a \"continuing resolution,\" maintains most government agencies at 2016 levels, but increases defense spending by $8 billion annually. It also provides $4.1 billion for disaster relief and reconstruction, addressing damage from hurricanes, floods, and severe drought, as well as $170 million for drinking water problems, including the lead-tainted water in Flint, Michigan.\n\nThe Senate overcame a late resistance from coal-state Democrats who had been pushing for a year-long extension of coal workers' health benefits. Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) stated that the party's push to the brink of a shutdown was to highlight the seriousness of the matter, rather than to shut down the government.\n\nThe House of Representatives had already adjourned for the year, leaving Senate GOP leaders to warn Democrats to either accept the measure as-is or face blame for a partial government shutdown. The spending bill passed with a vote of 63-36.\n\nA contentious water projects bill was also passed, with 78-21 votes. The bill, which includes 26 projects for California, was a point of contention for Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), who spoke out against drought provisions she viewed as an assault on environmental protections. However, the bill's popularity was evident in the House vote, with a margin of 360-61.\n\nThe passing of only one of the dozen annual spending bills leaves most agencies running on stopgap funding since October 1, the start of the fiscal year. The latest bill provides enough time for the incoming administration to get its team up and running before Congress resumes its budget fights.\n\nThe bill includes $7 million to reimburse law enforcement agencies protecting President-elect Donald Trump in Manhattan and a provision to clear the way for retired Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis to be the defense secretary, despite only leaving the military in 2013. The law requires at least seven years to have elapsed before a retired member of the military can take over at the Pentagon. Republicans aim to quickly approve a waiver of the law next year, but could face an extensive delay with Senate filibusters.\n\nThe standoff over miners' benefits emerged as the main sticking point, with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) stating that a year-long extension in benefits was necessary. The Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) stated that the miners' insurance would have expired at the end of the month if the spending resolution had not been passed, setting the stage for a new fight this spring. McConnell also criticized the Democratic approach to environmental policy, stating that it was devastating the coal sector.",
    " Title: Ferguson Voter Registration Numbers Corrected: Director of Elections Admits Error in Report\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Director of Elections in Ferguson, Missouri, has admitted to a mistake in the voter registration numbers reported earlier. The actual number of people who registered to vote following the August 9 police shooting of Michael Brown is 128, not 3,287 as previously stated.\n\nUSA Today's Yamiche Alcindor reported the discrepancy on October 7, citing the Director of Elections who stated, \"A discrepancy was identified in the report that provided us with the numbers we released to you last week.\" The Director further explained, \"After two days of meetings with the Secretary of State\u2019s Office, we were given the correct number.\"\n\nThe Director of Elections also expressed her surprise at the error, stating, \"I was flabbergasted by the mistake but that it was a mistake, pure and simple... no hanky-panky.\"\n\nYamiche Alcindor also tweeted that she had spoken to Laura Swinford from the Secretary of State's office, who confirmed that the St. Louis County Election Board had pulled the wrong report.\n\nPreviously, it was reported that since the shooting, 4,839 people in St. Louis County registered to vote, with 3,287 of those people living in Ferguson. This number was significantly higher than the number of people who registered to vote in Ferguson in 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n\nThe surge in voter registrations, while not necessarily translating to thousands of new votes, could potentially impact municipal elections. Only 1,484 of the 12,096 registered voters cast ballots during local elections in April.\n\nThe rise in registrations could reflect efforts, particularly by St. Louis committeeman Anthony Bell, to sign people up to vote during and after the height of the protests. The surge in voter registrations could be a sign of the residents of Ferguson seeking change in their local government, as many of Ferguson's residents have expressed concern that their local government does not represent the city's black community.\n\nThe problem, as previously reported, is low voter turnout during local elections in March and April. The overall turnout numbers for Ferguson's mayoral and city council election are discouraging, with just 12.3% of eligible voters casting a ballot in this year's election, according to numbers provided by the county. In 2013 and 2012, those figures were even lower: 11.7% and 8.9% respectively.\n\nThis correction in the voter registration numbers could have implications for the upcoming elections in Ferguson. The Director of Elections is yet to provide further details on the cause of the error and the impact it may have on the voter registration drive.",
    " Title: Treasury Secretary Warns of 'Catastrophic' Consequences if Debt Limit Not Raised\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stern warning to Congress, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew stated on Thursday that failing to raise the debt limit could lead to 'catastrophic' effects on the U.S. economy. Lew's remarks came during a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, where he criticized lawmakers who have questioned the severity of the situation.\n\nTreasury has predicted that the government will exhaust its borrowing capacity starting on Oct. 17, and will soon after be unable to pay all government bills on time and in full. Financial markets, which rely on U.S. debt securities, could experience significant turmoil, and the economy could be negatively impacted, according to Treasury officials, business leaders, and most economists.\n\nHowever, some Republicans have recently questioned the extent of the potential damage, while others and some market analysts have suggested there is more time for debt limit negotiations than Treasury has indicated.\n\nLew emphasized that it is irresponsible and reckless to allow a default to occur in order to learn about its consequences. He stated that the recent government shutdown should serve as a warning to avoid putting the entire economy at risk due to an ideological dispute.\n\nRepublicans have criticized Lew, arguing that he is attempting to scare financial markets into supporting a debt ceiling increase without attaching a budget deal or changes to the president's health care law to the legislation. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) accused Lew and President Barack Obama of causing unnecessary panic by suggesting that Social Security recipients and disabled workers would face deep cuts without an increase in the debt limit, while failing to explain how the government could manage a default.\n\nFinancial markets on Thursday were more focused on reports of growing interest in Congress for a short-term debt ceiling increase, as evidenced by the Dow Jones Industrial Average's rise of over 180 points in early morning trading.\n\nDuring the hearing, Lew addressed the idea that the Treasury Department could prioritize payments to bondholders, avoiding a technical default, while delaying payments to other government creditors such as Social Security recipients or contractors. Lew did not rule out this possibility, but did not provide details on how Treasury would manage a default.\n\nLew also questioned the meaningful difference between paying bondholders while other creditors are not, stating that prioritization is essentially a form of default. Under questioning from Hatch, Lew declined to specify the size of the debt limit increase the administration is seeking, stating that the president will sign any bill that avoids default and does not contain other policy provisions.\n\nLew concluded that a failure to raise the debt limit would result in 'deeply damaging' and 'catastrophic' effects on the economy.",
    " Title: Bridging the Ideological Divide: The Role of College Students in Countering Political Polarization\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the United States, political polarization has become a significant issue, with think tanks such as the Brookings Institution warning of its damaging effects on the political process. The Pew Research Center has found that Americans self-segregate politically, clustering geographically by ideology and consuming news with a bias towards their beliefs. This polarization can appear insurmountable, with political leaders seemingly beyond the reach of ordinary citizens. However, it is crucial for young Americans, and future political leaders, to take up the challenge of addressing this issue.\n\nAs college students, we are in a unique position to engage with individuals of differing views and counter political polarization. Understanding and empathy are key to this process. By actively seeking out and engaging with students of differing political perspectives, we can expand our understanding of their beliefs and develop a deeper, more personal connection.\n\nJoining non-partisan political organizations, such as the NU Political Union and Politics & Policy, has been instrumental in my own efforts to engage with students of differing political perspectives. Weekly debates have broadened my understanding of conservative political perspectives, and the friendships I've formed with Republican, libertarian, centrist, and even more radically liberal students have deepened my understanding of differing viewpoints on a personal level.\n\nEmpathy is crucial in countering the most insidious element of political polarization: the notion that one's opposition is inherently bad or even evil. By developing strong friendships with those of differing ideologies, we gain a glimpse into how fellow students' experiences have shaped their political beliefs.\n\nPolitical polarization extends beyond the Democrat-Republican divide, touching on overarching campus debates such as political correctness and sensitive issues like Israel-Palestine. For many students deeply involved in these discussions, politics are integral to identity. Discussing these issues can be difficult, but it is essential. Social psychological research shows that intergroup contact reduces animosity, even between groups on opposite sides of deeply entrenched conflict.\n\nCollege is the ideal opportunity to bridge the ideological divide. By sitting down with fellow students and discussing politics, we can build trust and establish a bond with those who disagree with us. Establishing boundaries, such as no personal attacks, picking a topic, and going from there, can help make these discussions productive and respectful. When politics are too sensitive to start with, building trust and establishing a bond with fellow students before touching on the more difficult issues is essential.\n\nIt is time for us, as future voters and political leaders, to take steps to end political polarization and self-segregation on our own campus. By reaching out and building friendships with those who disagree with us, we can foster empathy and, on a micro-scale, reduce political polarization. With each discussion, empathy builds, and political polarization subsides.\n\nThe views expressed in this piece do not necessarily reflect the views of all staff members of The \u2588\u2588\u2588.",
    " Title: The GOP's Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Political and Ideological Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a stark divide in the United States, not just in terms of policy decisions but also in individual behavior. A new poll by The New York Times and Siena College shows that voters overall prioritize controlling the pandemic over reopening the economy, but this preference is not shared equally across party lines. Republican voters, seemingly influenced by the White House and Fox News, hold the opposite view.\n\nMoreover, partisanship appears to influence individual actions, with self-identified Democrats more likely to adhere to mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines than self-identified Republicans. This raises the question of why the Republican Party, in effect, has aligned itself with the coronavirus.\n\nThe immediate answer lies in short-term politics. At the beginning of the year, President Donald Trump's re-election message was centered on economic triumphalism, with low unemployment rates and rising stock markets. The administration wasted crucial weeks denying the viral threat due to a reluctance to accept any negative news. They also advocated for premature reopening, aiming to restore the economy to its perceived state in February.\n\nEven as recently as a few days ago, the same Trump officials who initially downplayed the severity of Covid-19 were dismissing the risks of a second wave.\n\nHowever, the GOP's coronavirus denial may have roots that extend beyond Trump's electoral prospects. The key point is that Covid-19, like climate change, is a threat that the party is reluctant to acknowledge.\n\nIt is not that the right is averse to fearmongering. However, it does not want people to fear impersonal threats that necessitate policy responses, such as wearing face masks, but rather to fear people they can hate\u2014people of a different race or liberal elites.

Continuing on their current trajectory is likely to lead to greater isolation on their part, a situation which is not in anyone's interest.\"\n\nTillerson's departure follows a series of public rifts with the White House, which officially announced his dismissal via a tweet on Tuesday. Gina Haspel, the CIA's deputy director, was also named as the first female director of the agency.\n\nIn a press conference outside the White House, Trump attributed the differences between himself and Tillerson to personal \"chemistry.\" \"We got along actually quite well, but we disagreed on things,\" said the president. \"When you look at the Iran deal, I think it's terrible. I guess he thought it was OK.\"\n\nTillerson will not officially leave until March 31, but his deputy, John Sullivan, will take over running the State Department pending the confirmation of Pompeo. Tillerson emphasized the importance of an orderly and smooth transition during a time when the country faces significant policy and national security challenges.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Tillerson's dismissal have been the subject of conflicting accounts. While the White House maintains that Tillerson was informed of his termination by Chief of Staff John Kelly on Friday, Tillerson's team claims he felt unwell and decided to cut short his tour of Africa by a day.\n\nThe news of Tillerson's firing was reported by the Washington Post before Trump's tweet, according to a White House official. The departure of Tillerson marks another in a long line of senior officials who have either resigned or been fired since Trump took office.\n\nThe relationship between Tillerson and the White House was marked by a series of public disagreements, with the two sides offering different accounts of when Tillerson was informed of his dismissal. The end of Tillerson's tenure as secretary of state was a fitting metaphor for the tumultuous relationship between the two men, as they were described as \"men of different temperaments, demeanor, and style\" who had reached a parting of the ways.\n\nThe new secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the new CIA director, Gina Haspel, will both have to be confirmed by the Senate. Haspel's tenure at the CIA has been marred by allegations of her involvement in the operation of a CIA prison in Thailand where prisoners were waterboarded in 2002 and the destruction of videotapes of interrogations at the camp.\n\nReports of a rift between Trump and Tillerson have circulated since last year, with Tillerson being forced to deny claims he planned to quit and Trump publicly undercutting Tillerson by stating that he was \"wasting his time\" trying to negotiate with North Korea. In December, Tillerson offered to begin direct talks with Pyongyang without preconditions, a move that was distanced from by the White House.\n\nTillerson's career, once a giant in the corporate world, came to an ignominious end, marked by a tweet and a series of public disagreements with the president. The U.S. Senate will now have to decide whether to confirm Tillerson's successor, Mike Pompeo, and the new CIA director, Gina Haspel, as they navigate the complex world of foreign policy and national security.",
    " Title: Mental Health Professionals and the 25th Amendment: A Call for Caution and Ethical Integrity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the midst of ongoing political discourse, a debate has arisen over the mental health of President Donald Trump, with some mental health professionals suggesting that he may be suffering from conditions such as dementia or other mental illnesses. This has led to discussions about the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment, which outlines the process for removing a president who is unable to discharge the duties of the office.\n\nHowever, a Harvard Law School professor, who has extensive experience in law and psychiatry, has expressed concern over this line of argument. The professor, who has co-edited a basic text in the field and written numerous articles on the subject, argues that it is unprofessional, unethical, and absurd for mental health professionals to offer diagnoses or predictions about President Trump without having examined him.\n\nThe professor, who voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, emphasizes that while individuals are entitled to their opinions regarding the president's political and personal qualifications, mental health professionals have no more right to pathologize a president or a candidate because they disagree with their political views than do prosecutors or politicians have a right to criminalize political opponents.\n\nThe professor draws parallels to historical instances where political opponents were diagnosed with mental illnesses, such as the Soviet Union, China, and apartheid South Africa, where perfectly sane people were locked up in psychiatric wards or prisons due to phony diagnoses. The professor was involved in the American Psychiatric Association's strong stand against this practice, as it is dangerous to diagnose political opponents instead of responding to the merits or demerits of their political views.\n\nThe professor also recalls the 1964 presidential election, where similar allegations were made against Senator Barry Goldwater. In an article published in Fact magazine, more than 1,100 psychiatrists concluded that Goldwater was mentally unstable and psychologically unfit to be president. The professor, who was of voting age during this election, found the article unpersuasive and voted for President Lyndon Johnson despite his reservations about Johnson's personal fitness. Goldwater, it turned out, was wrongly diagnosed, as none of the psychiatrists had ever examined or met him.\n\nThe professor concludes by emphasizing that debates about the merits and demerits of President Trump's policies, effectiveness, personality, and other relevant factors are crucial for democracy. However, diagnoses should be left to doctors who have examined their patients, and not used to remove a duly elected president from office on amateurish speculation. The professor calls for caution and ethical integrity in these discussions, as they are of utmost importance to the functioning of a democratic society.",
    " Title: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Advocates for Constitutional Amendment to Limit Campaign Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at curbing the influence of outside political spending, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment that would restrict campaign contributions. The amendment, introduced earlier this year by Democratic Sens. Tom Udall of New Mexico and Michael Bennet of Colorado, seeks to give Congress the authority to regulate campaign spending limits for federal elections.\n\nReid announced on the Senate floor that the Judiciary Committee would soon hold a hearing on the amendment, and that the full Senate would vote on the legislation. The measure, if passed, would aim to rein in the spending of super PACs, which have grown significantly since the 2010 Citizens United decision, a Supreme Court ruling that removed legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums on federal elections.\n\nThe amendment is expected to pass the Judiciary Committee, as it only requires a simple majority to advance. However, its chances of passing the full Senate, where it needs a two-thirds majority, are slim due to broad GOP opposition.\n\nReid, in his remarks, targeted the billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch, who have spent hundreds of millions since 2010, through the conservative non-profit political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity and other organizations, to attack Democrats and support Republicans. Overall, pro-GOP outside groups have heavily outspent their pro-Democratic rivals since the 2010 Supreme Court ruling opened the floodgates.\n\n\"There is absolutely no question the Koch brothers are in a category of their own, in both degree and kind. No one else pumping money into the shadowy campaign organizations and campaigns like they are. There isn't even a close second,\" Reid said. \"They are doing this to promote issues that make themselves even richer.\"\n\nReid called for a level playing field, stating, \"Let's get this money out of our political system. Let's undo the damage done by the citizens united decision. Let's do it now.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell responded to Reid's comments, stating, \"Today's proposal by the Senate Majority Leader represents an all-out assault on the right to free speech, a right which undergirds all others in our democracy.\" McConnell, who faces a tough re-election this year, added, \"Proposing to take away this fundamental right from the American people and vest it in the federal government instead is the ultimate act of radicalism.\"\n\nThe issue of campaign spending was also in the Supreme Court's spotlight earlier this spring, with a 5-4 ruling eliminating limits on how much money individuals can donate in one election season. The decision left intact the current $5,200 limit on how much an individual can give to any single candidate during a two-year election cycle. The ruling means a wealthy donor can now give as much money as desired to federal election candidates across the country, as long as no candidate receives more than the $5,200 cap.\n\nThe constitutional amendment faces all-but-certain defeat on the Senate floor, but Democrats believe public opinion is on their side, and that the efforts to push the amendment could motivate their base, which is crucial in traditionally low-turnout midterm contests.",
    " Title: House Republicans Introduce Bill to Allow Americans to Keep Their Health Plans Amidst ObamaCare Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Congress resumes following the holiday recess, the focus shifts to a House Republican-backed bill aimed at allowing Americans to maintain their current health plans amidst the ongoing controversy surrounding President Obama's Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare). The bill, which is set for a vote on Friday, capitalizes on President Obama's recent apology for earlier statements assuring the public that they could keep their health insurance if they were satisfied with their existing plans.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee bill is a strategic move by Republicans, who have been under fire for the troubled rollout of the ObamaCare website last month. The bill serves as a new line of attack, with members in both chambers now targeting the law more aggressively, including the previously challenging strategy of attempting to dismantle the law piece by piece.\n\nAlthough Democrats have historically opposed this approach, some moderate Democrats are now showing support for the Republican bill. The bill's central argument is that the president's apology indicates a willingness to offer relief to Americans whose health plans are being canceled, and that he should support the Keep Your Health Plan Act more actively.\n\nIn addition to the House bill, Republicans have also proposed legislation to delay the individual mandate, mirroring the president's delay of the employer mandate, and to ensure that low-income individuals receiving federal subsidies for insurance actually qualify for them.\n\nRepublican strategists argue that maintaining a focus on ObamaCare throughout the 2016 presidential election cycle is a winning strategy, citing the recent Virginia gubernatorial race in which Republican nominee Ken Cuccinelli, despite losing, managed to close a significant lead by repeatedly criticizing the law in the campaign's final weeks.\n\nSome Democrats are also seeking to amend the law, particularly senators running for re-election in conservative-leaning states. Notable examples include Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, and Kay Hagan of North Carolina, who are also facing conservative groups promising to spend millions to demonstrate their early support for ObamaCare.\n\nLandrieu, in fact, introduced a bill last week that mirrors the House bill, allowing Americans to keep their existing health plans. \"When we passed the Affordable Care Act, we did so with the intention that if you liked your health plan, you could keep it,\" she said. \"A promise was made, and this legislation will ensure that this promise is kept. I have said repeatedly that the act is not perfect, and I am willing to work with anyone who wants to improve it and implement it correctly.\"",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Rules Out Negotiations on Senate's Immigration Bill, Signaling Stalemate on Immigration Reform\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development on Wednesday, House Speaker John A. Boehner declared that the House would not engage in negotiations with the Senate on the Senate's immigration bill, effectively signaling a stalemate on the contentious issue and raising major hurdles for any action before the midterm elections.\n\nEmerging from a meeting with fellow Republicans, Mr. Boehner stated that he would not be bound by President Obama's timeline on action this year, and firmly rejected the Senate's approach, which would legalize most illegal immigrants and rewrite the legal immigration system.\n\n\"We've made it clear that we're going to move on a common-sense, step-by-step approach in terms of how we deal with immigration,\" Mr. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, told reporters after the meeting. \"The idea that we're going to take up a 1,300-page bill that no one had ever read, which is what the Senate did, is not going to happen in the House. And frankly, I'll make clear we have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill.\"\n\nThis marked a significant about-face for Mr. Boehner, who, immediately after President Obama's re-election a year ago, had said he expected to work with the president on the issue, even using the term \"comprehensive\" \u2013 a term that, in the immigration debate, has come to mean the broad legalization approach that Mr. Obama and Democrats want.\n\nImmigrant rights supporters expressed disappointment but were not ready to give up hope for action, believing that political pressure will force House Republicans to act sometime next year.\n\n\"I believe the House will come to its senses and realize that we have to fix our immigration system in a bipartisan way,\" said Sen. Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who wrote the Senate bill.\n\nThe Senate bill called for quick legal status for most illegal immigrants, though it withheld a full pathway to citizenship until after the Homeland Security Department invested in more Border Patrol agents, doubled the length of pedestrian fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, and purchased more equipment and technology. The Senate bill also would revamp the legal immigration system to let in more foreigners based on job skills or deep family ties.\n\nHouse Republicans rejected that broad approach and said they would write a series of bills dealing with immigration in pieces. House committees have cleared bills dealing with border security, interior enforcement, and guest-worker programs, and leaders were working on a bill that would have legalized young illegal immigrants.\n\nCongressional Democrats and Mr. Obama had held out hope that the House would pass some of those bills, then go to a conference committee to hammer out a final deal with the Senate. That final deal, Mr. Obama said, would have to include citizenship rights for most illegal immigrants.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Boehner appeared to be taking a step back. He said he asked House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Virginia Republican, to develop a broad set of principles for addressing immigration.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney said it seemed \"a little bit late in the game\" and noted that Mr. Obama already has laid out principles that the House should follow.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates said Republicans were risking their political lives.\n\n\"Should they slow-walk it until they get to 'no' this year and in this Congress, Boehner will go down in history as the man that sealed his party's fate with the fastest-growing groups of voters in America,\" said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a lobby group.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, sent a tweet telling Mr. Boehner it should be easy to take up immigration. She pointed to the bill she and fellow House Democrats introduced that would take the Senate's legalization program, strip out the specific, tough border security measures, and replace them with a call for Homeland Security to devise a security plan.\n\nMrs. Pelosi said she believes the House has enough votes to pass her bill.\n\nImmediately after Mr. Obama won re-election last year, Mr. Boehner announced that immigration would be a key area of agreement between the president and House Republicans. Pundits also urged Republican lawmakers to work with Mr. Obama. Columnist Charles Krauthammer said Republicans should unapologetically embrace \"amnesty,\" while prominent talk show host Sean Hannity said he supported a pathway to citizenship.\n\nBut the backlash from rank-and-file House Republicans was swift, and Mr. Boehner and his lieutenants have spent most of the past year trying to figure out a way forward that won't cost him the support of his conference. Even Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who helped craft the Senate bill, later abandoned it, telling his House colleagues to follow their own path and not to enter into negotiations with the Senate.",
    " Title: Trump's New Tariffs on Brazil and Argentina Spark Uncertainty and Currency War Fears\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising move, President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina, citing manipulation of their currencies. This new rationale marks a departure from Trump's 2018 tariff imposition and adds to the ongoing global trade uncertainties.\n\nThe tariffs, announced recently, have sparked criticism from the left, who view the move as another unpredictable trade shock from the White House. The move comes at a time when business leaders are calling for more certainty in the face of the ongoing US-China trade spat and the unresolved USMCA agreement with Mexico and Canada.\n\nIn his announcement, Trump also called on the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, a move that could weaken the U.S. dollar and potentially escalate the situation into a currency war. This request, coming from a president who has often criticized other countries for manipulating their currencies, has raised eyebrows.\n\nBoth Brazil and Argentina are currently grappling with their own economic woes. Argentina's outgoing right-leaning administration has been battling a financial crisis, including controlling the falling peso. Brazil's own currency has suffered recently, with Argentina's economic struggles contributing to the problem, according to Trump's own Treasury Department.\n\nThe political implications of Trump's announcement are also intriguing. Brazil's new right-wing populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, has strengthened the country's relationship with the Trump administration, and there was talk of a possible US-Brazil free trade deal. However, Trump's latest move could potentially complicate these relations.\n\nThe US-China trade spat has already rattled the global economy, and Trump is still waging a trade battle with the EU. He has yet to get his revised NAFTA deal through Congress, though there's still hope there. Now, as the 2020 election year approaches, Trump is adding even more volatility to America's trade situation by targeting Brazil and Argentina.\n\nThis was the year things were supposed to change between Brazil and the United States. The end of leftist rule in Brazil and the election of Jair Bolsonaro, an avowed fan of President Trump and the United States, was expected to usher in a new era of cooperation. However, Trump's latest move could potentially derail these plans.\n\nInvestors are betting on a partial trade deal with China, hoping it will boost economic growth, sustain the bull market in stocks, and offer the hope of calmer waters for global commerce. However, a partial deal may make a broader agreement even harder to achieve.\n\nTrump's tougher rhetoric and escalating tariffs represent an extreme version of a shifting consensus, and they certainly got Beijing's attention. However, his demands, beyond more orders to reduce America's trade deficit with China, were vague, and his negotiating tactics left the Chinese wondering if any deal would stick. The next phase of negotiations offers Beijing few incentives to tackle sensitive structural reforms.\n\nMeanwhile, in the realm of domestic politics, the Democratic presidential candidates are also making headlines. Elizabeth Warren has provided more detail on Medicare financing than her competitors, including Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. However, her Medicare plan, which forces people to join rather than allowing them to opt in, has sparked concerns about radical changes to the health care system.\n\nBiden's opposition to marijuana legalization puts him at odds with the majority of Democrats and even a majority of Republicans, who support legalization. This stance, coupled with his long record of pushing for punitive criminal justice and drug policies, reinforces concerns about his stance on criminal justice reform.\n\nIn conclusion, the global trade landscape is becoming increasingly complex, with the US-China trade spat, the USMCA agreement, and now the new tariffs on Brazil and Argentina. Meanwhile, the Democratic presidential candidates are also making headlines with their policy proposals and stances on key issues. The coming months will be crucial in determining the direction of global trade and the future of the US presidency.",
    " Title: U.S. Consumer Prices Rise in June Amid Economic Reopening, Inflation Remains Moderate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the U.S. consumer prices increased by 0.6% in June, marking the largest monthly rise since August 2012, as businesses reopened following the Covid-19 pandemic-induced shutdown. However, the underlying trend suggests that inflation will remain subdued, allowing the Federal Reserve to continue its monetary support for the ailing economy.\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department reported on Tuesday that its Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased in June, with the rise primarily driven by increases in the prices of gasoline and food. Over the past 12 months, the CPI climbed 0.6%, following a 0.1% increase in May, which was the smallest year-on-year rise since September 2015.\n\nEconomists, polled by Reuters, had forecasted a 0.5% increase in June and a 0.6% year-on-year rise. The reopening of businesses, which occurred after they shuttered in mid-March to curb the spread of Covid-19, has been accompanied by a surge in new cases in large parts of the country, leading some states to reconsider or pause their reopening plans.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been injecting money into the economy through various measures, including large-scale asset purchases and providing loans to businesses. Additionally, the government has provided nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus, contributing to a record monthly budget deficit in June.\n\nDespite the unprecedented stimulus, economists expect inflation to remain benign due to the high number of people\u201433 million\u2014receiving unemployment benefits. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.2% in June, with increases in the costs of apparel and healthcare offset by a moderation in rental inflation.\n\nThe so-called core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 1.2% in the 12 months through June, matching May's gain. The core CPI had dropped for three consecutive months for the first time since the series began in 1957.\n\nThe Federal Reserve tracks the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index increased 1.0% on a year-on-year basis in May, the smallest advance since December 2010. June's core PCE price index data will be released at the end of this month.",
    " Title: Multiple Incidents of Suspected Terrorism and Violence Sweep Across U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of unsettling events across the United States on Saturday, an improvised explosive device (IED) went off at a Marine Charity 5K event in Seaside Park, New Jersey, causing no injuries. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently investigating the incident to determine if it was an act of terrorism. Meanwhile, in New York City, an explosion occurred in the Chelsea neighborhood, injuring an estimated 29 people but resulting in no fatalities. Authorities are also investigating a possible secondary device in the area. In a separate incident, a stabbing rampage took place at a shopping center in St. Cloud, Minnesota, resulting in multiple injuries and the death of the attacker.\n\nIn Seaside Park, New Jersey, multiple explosive devices were found inside a trash can, designed to send shrapnel flying. However, only one of the devices detonated, potentially sparing lives and avoiding injuries. Remnants and residue from the bomb are being sent to an FBI lab for analysis. The exact cause of the device's detonation, the type of explosive used, and whether any surveillance cameras captured a suspect planting the device remain unknown.\n\nAt the Seaside Semper Five Marine Corps Charity 5K, the race was delayed due to the discovery of a backpack near a media tent. The delay may have inadvertently saved lives and avoided injuries, as the pipe-bomb that detonated later would have gone off during the race.\n\nIn New York City, an explosion occurred around 8:30 pm EST, injuring an estimated 29 people but causing no fatalities. Authorities are investigating a possible secondary device in the area, but this is not yet confirmed. There are conflicting reports as to whether the explosion was caused by an IED.\n\nIn St. Cloud, Minnesota, a stabbing rampage took place at a shopping center, resulting in multiple injuries and the death of the attacker. The mall remains in lockdown, and authorities are still clearing the scene.\n\nAs the nation grapples with these incidents, political figures and the media are offering their perspectives. Some are criticizing the response and actions of political candidates, while others are focusing on the ongoing investigations and the well-being of the victims. The investigations into these incidents are ongoing, and more information is expected to be released in the coming days.",
    " Title: Clinton Refuses to Hand Over Email Server, Claims Server Wiped Clean in Response to Benghazi Committee's Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a setback for the special investigative committee looking into the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has refused to turn her email server over to an independent third party, instead claiming she has wiped the server clean. This development was announced late Friday by Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy.\n\nGowdy stated that the House will have to decide on the next steps in the push to obtain information from Mrs. Clinton, but she is expected to testify on her decision-making regarding her emails, setting up another potential confrontation between the former first lady and her congressional critics.\n\nGowdy criticized Mrs. Clinton's actions in a statement, stating, \"Not only was the secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record, she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server, ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest.\"\n\nIn response to Gowdy's subpoena, Mrs. Clinton reportedly re-transmitted several hundred pages of emails that the State Department has already turned over. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, the top Democrat on the Benghazi probe, argued that this proves Mrs. Clinton has already produced all of her official records concerning the terrorist attack.\n\n\"It is time for the committee to stop this political charade and instead make these documents public and schedule Secretary Clinton's public testimony now,\" Cummings said.\n\nAt a press conference earlier this month, Mrs. Clinton explained that she culled through more than 60,000 emails from her time as secretary and decided about 30,000 of them were public records that should have been maintained. She said the rest were private messages relating to her daughter's wedding or her yoga class schedule, and she didn't keep those.\n\nHowever, Gowdy said Mrs. Clinton's lawyers informed him Friday that she \"unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails\" from it. It is unclear when Mrs. Clinton made the final decision, but it appears to have happened after the State Department asked her to turn over her government business messages in late October.\n\nMrs. Clinton's use of a private email account during her four-year tenure as secretary has been a point of contention. She initially relied on an account she used while a senator, and later set up an email server at her home in New York and used it to conduct all of her business, both public and private.\n\nMrs. Clinton insists she followed the law, which at the time didn't require officials to use government-issued accounts but did require them to turn over all official records to be stored. Mrs. Clinton didn't turn over those records until last December, after the Benghazi probe noticed she had used a private email and requested those records from the State Department, which then asked Mrs. Clinton for them. The law doesn't set a date for turning over records.\n\nOpen-records experts, however, question Mrs. Clinton's designation of her server as private, saying it was set up in order to do government business, and so it and the emails on it arguably belong to the government.\n\nThe Clinton email controversy has put the Obama administration in a difficult position. Obama lawyers have admitted in federal court that for years, they were not correctly performing open-records searches because they didn't have her emails, but they say they are unilaterally going back and doing those searches now.",
    " Title: Polish President Expresses Reservations Over Trump's Proposal to Reinstate Russia in G-7\n\nArticle:\n\nWarsaw, Poland \u2013 Polish President Andrzej Duda voiced serious reservations on Monday regarding President Donald Trump's campaign to reinstate Russia into the Group of Seven (G-7), expressing his concerns during a joint news conference with Vice President Mike Pence at the Presidential Palace.\n\nDuring the conference, Duda, whose country heavily relies on U.S. military support, did not outright reject Trump's proposal but made it clear that he was not enthusiastic about the idea. \"I believe we must not proceed according to the business-as-usual principle\" when it comes to Russia, Duda said, speaking through an interpreter. \"This is my position, and I do not hesitate to express it.\"\n\nDuda's comments came on the second and final day of Pence's visit to the Polish capital. Pence made the trip after Trump canceled his plans to travel to Poland, citing the need to monitor Hurricane Dorian in the United States.\n\nWhile Duda was not supportive of Trump's push to readmit Russia to the G-7, he was sympathetic to Trump's reasons for canceling his visit. Trump had to postpone his visit due to \"the nature of things which cannot be predicted,\" Duda said. Trump has stated his intention to reschedule, and Duda expressed hope that Trump can make the trip this fall.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for other member nations to allow Russia back into the group in recent weeks. He made the case last week during the group's annual gathering in Biarritz, France. Trump argued that readmitting Russia to the group would ease negotiations on global issues.\n\nRussia was a member of the group, then known as the G-8, but was ousted in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea. The decision was supported not only by the U.S. but also by the group's other six member countries. The G-7 is made up of the United States, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Italy.\n\nDuring the news conference, Duda also expressed concerns about bringing Russia back into the fold, citing Russia's continued occupation of Crimea and other issues. \"Russia, over the last years, has been undertaking actions which... nobody who wants to have peace in the world, and nobody who respects the dignity of other nations and states, can turn a blind eye to,\" he said.\n\nFor his part, Pence lauded the \"remarkable bond\" between the U.S. and Poland and stressed that NATO allies must remain \"vigilant\" about countering \"the intentions and the actions taken by Russia.\"\n\nDuring his two-day visit to the Polish capital, Pence delivered remarks at a ceremony commemorating the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II and held bilateral meetings with Duda and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn his meeting with Duda, Pence said they discussed several issues, including Poland's plan to buy weaponry from the United States, the U.S.'s plans to send an additional 1,000 troops to Poland, and the possible establishment of a permanent military base for U.S. troops in Poland.\n\n\"Make no mistake about it,\" Pence said. \"This alliance, this relationship between America and Poland, has never been stronger.\"\n\nThe two countries also signed a joint agreement calling for them to work together to improve the security of Poland's 5G telecommunications system. The deal comes as the Trump administration is trying to counter the influence of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei. The U.S. accuses Huawei of facilitating Chinese spying, a charge the company denies.\n\nAsked if Poland has any evidence that China has used Huawei technology for spying, Duda said Polish counterintelligence services have detected actions \"which might have been of an espionage nature.\"",
    " Title: 6th Circuit Court of Appeals Upholds Contraception Mandate, Sending Case to Supreme Court\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a split decision, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday sided with the Obama administration in the ongoing legal battle over the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act. This marks the second time a federal appeals court has ruled against a company that objected to the mandate on religious grounds.\n\nThe court's decision comes after a similar ruling in July by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which granted Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma City crafts franchise, an injunction shielding it from the mandate. However, the 6th Circuit's ruling, based in Cincinnati, requires a Michigan-based manufacturing company, Autocam, to comply with the mandate despite the owners' Roman Catholic beliefs.\n\nThe Kennedy family, like other plaintiffs, argued that the Obama administration's rule required them to choose between violating their beliefs, dropping Autocam employees' health coverage, or facing hefty fines for non-compliance. The 6th Circuit panel ruled that the Kennedys' actions were not taken in an individual capacity but as officers and directors of the corporation.\n\nThe court agreed with government lawyers who stated that Autocam had not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success in challenging the mandate. In contrast, the 10th Circuit granted Hobby Lobby an injunction, while the 3rd Circuit provided no relief to Pennsylvania-based Conestoga Wood Specialties.\n\nKyle Duncan, general counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents some of the plaintiffs, stated that the split rulings set the stage for Supreme Court review. The Obama administration has until September 25 to decide whether it will appeal the Hobby Lobby case to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe contraception mandate has been a contentious issue, with conservative lawmakers and religious groups advocating for a religious exemption from the mandate, citing objections to certain forms of contraception, particularly morning-after pills equated with abortion. Supporters of the mandate argue that contraception is essential and often unaffordable for many women, and that corporate owners should not impose their personal beliefs on their employees by removing contraception coverage from their health plans.\n\nThe Obama administration has previously offered an accommodation for religious nonprofits, allowing employees to acquire contraception coverage through separate policies set up by their companies' insurers or third-party administrators. However, some objectors have expressed concerns that this accommodation does not adequately address their issues.",
    " Title: House Republicans Criticize Senate for Failing to Pass Health Care Repeal Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nA group of House Republicans convened on Capitol Hill Friday voiced their disapproval of the Senate's inability to pass the health care repeal bill earlier in the day, stating that they had fulfilled their part of the legislative process in May, and the Senate had not upheld their end of the agreement.\n\nRep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia, referring to the House health care bill passed in May, stated, \"The Senate's got to do the Senate thing.

If the Senate is incapable of functioning, then the House will have to once again step up to the plate and figure out what we're going to do.\"\n\nRep. Diane Black, who chairs the House Budget Committee, criticized the Senate for breaking their promise to \"save\" Americans from Obamacare.\n\n\"The Senate's failure to even continue the legislative process is a slap in the face to the voters that trusted and elected them. They deserve better,\" Black said.\n\nIn a dramatic early-morning vote, the Senate voted down Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's latest offer of a bill that would repeal or delay some of Obamacare's mandates and taxes. The bill failed on a 49-51 vote, with three Republican senators - Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain of Arizona, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska - joining Democrats to doom the legislation.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan was more diplomatic than some in his conference, stating Friday he is \"disappointed and frustrated\" but that lawmakers should not give up.\n\n\"While the House delivered a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, unfortunately, the Senate was unable to reach a consensus,\" Mr. Ryan said in a statement.\n\nRep. Trent Franks, Arizona Republican, expressed concern about the Senate's inability to pass the bill, stating, \"We're in a situation here where the parliamentary physics of the existing Senate rule construct makes doing things almost impossible if they're of consequence.\"",
    " Title: Domestic Terrorism in Oregon: A Call for Patience and Strategy in Dealing with Armed Protesters\n\nArticle:\n\nCNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, former assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and founder of Kayyem Solutions, has labeled the armed protesters occupying a federal building in Oregon as domestic terrorists. In her commentary, Kayyem argues that the group's actions, regardless of their self-proclaimed peaceful intentions or claims of being a lawful militia, constitute a threat to public safety and the rule of law.\n\nKayyem asserts that the group's political motivations, which seem to stem from opposition to the imprisonment of a local rancher for arson, are not a valid justification for the use of violence or the flouting of federal law. She emphasizes that the group's actions should not be excused simply because they are not associated with Islamic extremism.\n\nThe situation in Oregon, according to Kayyem, is a form of domestic terrorism, and the federal response should be handled with caution and strategy. Violence should be avoided, and the standoff should be prolonged to wear down the protesters and create opportunities for division and negotiation.\n\nKayyem suggests that the federal authorities should take their time, using tactics such as offering reduced sentences or misdemeanor charges to those who surrender or disarm. She also recommends that the Obama administration should be prepared to mobilize federal military support if necessary, to make a statement about the importance of upholding the rule of law in a civil society.\n\nKayyem warns against allowing emotions to cloud the decision-making process, as local law enforcement officials may have personal relationships with the protesters that could lead to leniency or overzealousness. She also points out that a heavy-handed response could inadvertently turn the protesters into martyrs, as was the case in the Waco siege in 1993, which some argue led to the Oklahoma City bombing two years later.\n\nIn conclusion, Kayyem urges patience and strategic thinking in dealing with the armed protesters in Oregon, emphasizing that they are domestic terrorists who are putting the community at risk. She suggests that the federal authorities should use time to their advantage, divide and conquer the group, and make a clear statement about the importance of upholding the rule of law.",
    " Title: Democratic Official Clarifies Interpretation of \"Z\" in Ukraine Impeachment Trial Documents\n\nArticle:\n\nA Democratic official involved in the ongoing impeachment trial has acknowledged that the initial interpretation of the term \"z\" in the impeachment inquiry documents may have been incorrect. However, the official maintains that \"z\" was commonly used as a shorthand for \"Zelensky\" among those involved in the Ukraine pressure campaign.\n\nThe official emphasized that the word document does not reveal its author or source, and that there is no doubt that Giuliani and Parnas sought \"high-level engagement with President Zelensky and his administration.\"\n\n\"Beginning with Mr. Giuliani's May 10 letter to President Zelensky two months earlier and leading up to Mr. Giuliani's August 2 meeting with Mr. Zelensky's representatives in Spain, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Parnas actively sought high-level engagement with President Zelensky and his administration to carry out the President's corrupt scheme,\" the official stated. \"If Mr. Giuliani sought out dirt from other sources, that would be consistent with their overall effort.\"\n\nThe official's statement comes as Democrats have not based their impeachment trial arguments primarily on Parnas' new allegations, making limited references to the former Giuliani associate in their brief. However, it appears that Democrats may have misjudged at least one instance where they thought they found an example of Parnas trying to arrange a meeting between Giuliani and Zelensky, according to the unredacted material.\n\nDemocrats received the Parnas evidence from the courts only last week and were scrambling to sort through all the materials ahead of the Senate impeachment trial. A Republican aide criticized the Democrats' handling of the situation, stating, \"The most charitable view of the situation is that [Schiff's] staff committed the equivalent of Congressional malpractice by not looking more than an inch deep to determine the facts before foisting this erroneous information on his colleagues and the American public.\"\n\nThe aide further added, \"Given the selective redactions and contextual clues, it seems as though Chairman Schiff sought to portray an innocuous meeting with Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky as an insidious one with the President of Ukraine simply because both of their surnames start with the letter Z.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl Faces Desertion and Misbehavior Charges, Potentially Facing Life in Prison\n\nArticle:\n\nU.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was held captive by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly five years, was formally charged on Wednesday with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The Army stated that if convicted of the most serious count, desertion, Bergdahl could be sentenced to life in prison.\n\nBergdahl's attorney, Eugene Fidell of Yale Law School, announced that an Article 32 investigation hearing will take place on April 22 at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a court-martial.\n\nBergdahl, 28, disappeared on June 30, 2009, from Combat Outpost Mest-Lalak in Paktika Province in eastern Afghanistan and was subsequently captured. He left his post early one morning, abandoning his gun, ammunition, and body armor.\n\nThe Army's decision to move ahead with charges follows a period of rehabilitation following Bergdahl's release and his reassignment to military duties at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio.\n\nThe desertion charge carries a maximum prison term of five years, while the misbehavior count carries a maximum term of life in prison. The charges also include potential punishments such as a dishonorable discharge, reduction in rank to private, and forfeiture of all pay.\n\nBergdahl's parents declined to comment on the Army's decision to charge their son, and some residents in his hometown of Hailey, Idaho, expressed reluctance to comment on the developments. A rally for Bergdahl was abruptly canceled last summer amid the political uproar.\n\nFormer Army Sergeant Evan Buetow, who served with Bergdahl, stated on Wednesday that the former war prisoner needed \"to answer for what he did.\" Buetow claimed that Bergdahl's actions put all of their lives in danger, and that men from their company died when he left his post.\n\nRepublican lawmakers also backed the Army's decision to move ahead with the charges. Senator John McCain, head of the Senate Armed Services Committee and himself a Vietnam War prisoner, said it was an \"important step\" toward determining Bergdahl's accountability. Representative Mac Thornberry, head of the House Armed Services Committee, accused the administration of making the case more difficult by failing \"to follow the law surrounding the release of the Taliban 5.\"\n\nThe Army's investigation into Bergdahl's case has been under review by General Mark Milley, head of U.S. Army Forces Command. As a result of the review, Bergdahl was charged with desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty and misbehavior before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command, unit, or place.",
    " Title: Presidential Hopeful Ben Carson Threatens to Leave Republican Party Amid Brokered Convention Discussions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, presidential hopeful Ben Carson has threatened to leave the Republican Party following reports of a closed-door meeting among Republican establishment leaders discussing the possibility of a brokered national convention.\n\nThe retired neurosurgeon expressed his displeasure Friday morning, taking aim at the reported gathering that included Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, among others. The Washington Post reported that the meeting centered on the potential outcome of the party's prolonged primary election season, with no clear winner in sight.\n\nCarson, in a statement, warned that if the reported plan to potentially override the voters' will in favor of political elites' preferences was indeed true, Donald Trump would not be the only one departing the party.\n\n\"If this was the beginning of a plan to subvert the will of the voters and replace it with the will of the political elite, I assure you Donald Trump will not be the only one leaving the party,\" Carson stated, referencing Trump's repeated threats to exit the GOP if treated unfairly.\n\n\"I pray that the report in the Post this morning was incorrect,\" Carson added. \"If it is correct, every voter who is standing for change must know they are being betrayed. I won't stand for it.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee did not immediately respond to inquiries regarding the meeting and Carson's threat.\n\nA third-party bid by Carson or Trump could prove disastrous for the GOP. While Carson's poll numbers have dwindled, an independent campaign drawing even a few percentage points away from the party's nominee could make it nearly impossible for the Republican nominee to secure a victory in the general election.\n\nDoug Watts, Carson's spokesman, stated that the candidate was appalled by reports suggesting Republican leaders were attempting to manipulate the party's presidential nominating process. Watts acknowledged that Carson, like Trump and the rest of the Republican field, had signed a pledge not to launch a third-party bid.\n\n\"The pledge is not meaningless,\" Watts said. \"But he signed the pledge based on everybody playing by the rules.\"",
    " Title: \"A Comparative Analysis of Governmental Influence and Individual Liberties: A Look at China and the United States\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a stark contrast of political landscapes, China and the United States, two of the world's superpowers, are currently grappling with the delicate balance between governmental influence and individual liberties.\n\nRecent events in China have seen an unprecedented display of fervor not witnessed since the Mao era, with street-side banners, publicity tours, and choral performances celebrating the words of General Secretary Xi Jinping. The Chinese Communist Party is leaving no stone unturned in its efforts to educate the masses about the benefits of party and state policies, as the dance troupe director puts it, \"It's our duty to educate the masses about how they benefit from party and state policies.\"\n\nIn stark contrast, the United States, a land often touted as the beacon of freedom, is embroiled in a debate over individual liberties and governmental intervention. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court heard a case centering on the question of whether a Colorado baker, on religious grounds, can deny a gay couple's request for a wedding cake. The court's decision is expected to be close, with Justice Anthony Kennedy, known for his pivotal role in many decisions, likely to play a decisive role.\n\nThe case, and the subsequent media coverage and social media reaction, raises a larger question: Where is the stopping point for the promulgation, promotion, and especially the enforcement of views backed more by government power than by popular consensus? In Xi Jinping's China, the question is a moot point, with the government's power seemingly limitless. In the United States, consent of the governed has long been the political cornerstone, but the definition of \"consent\" remains a contentious issue.\n\nHistorical examples, such as the busing for racial balance in the 1960s, serve as a cautionary tale. Federal judges, in their quest for racial balance in schools, inadvertently created the greatest educational disaster in American history. Busing, wherever and whenever practiced, led to widespread segregation, a stark contrast to the pre-Brown v. Board of Education era.\n\nGovernment attempts to silence or impede doubters on the issue of gay marriage could have similar negative effects, keeping the pot boiling and stifling attempts at reconciliation. The aim of reconciliation, often the target of educators and judicial figures, is, in practice, the aim most despised.\n\nThe \"American way of life\" is a phrase accommodating a wide spectrum of beliefs and lifestyles. However, freedom from unnecessary molding of thought and behavior by government notables is a freedom that is increasingly under threat. The question of how we got to this stage in American history is a question for another time. That we got here at all, and found government taking us by the elbow, jerking us this way and that way, denying access to other, possibly appealing ways\u2014that's the present conundrum.\n\nOne that wouldn't wring a single sympathetic tear from Gen. Secretary Xi.",
    " Title: Congressional Investigation Reveals Lax Oversight of Chinese Propaganda on Major Social Media Platforms\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing congressional investigation into the failure of major social media companies to police suspect content has revealed that these platforms are allowing the Chinese Communist Party to disseminate propaganda to American audiences with little oversight or warning. The House Foreign Affairs Committee has been pressing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to deplatform Chinese Communist Party officials and news outlets for disseminating propaganda, particularly related to the coronavirus, but each of the sites has failed to take adequate action.\n\nInvestigators with the House Foreign Affairs Committee have found that Communist Party propaganda freely circulates on these sites without labels identifying the information as questionable. While each of these sites has begun aggressively policing conservative provocateurs and even President Donald Trump, they have been lax about applying the same standards to Chinese officials and state-controlled news outlets that regularly traffic in unfounded conspiracy theories. In many cases, these websites allowed communist leaders and outlets to post outright lies about the coronavirus pandemic, including the claim that American military leaders created the coronavirus and planted it in China.\n\nThe investigation, run by House Foreign Affairs Committee leader Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), is part of a broader effort by congressional leaders to crack down on China's influence operations in the United States. The findings of the investigation were presented in the form of report cards grading each company on whether it has banned communist officials and news outlets, applied warning labels to their content, and fact-checked their claims for accuracy. All of the websites failed these tests: Twitter received a D-, Facebook a C+, and YouTube a C-, grades that imply each still permits the dissemination of anti-U.S. communist propaganda, often without warning labels for readers.\n\nMcCaul's team first started investigating these sites in March, when he petitioned them to ban Communist Party officials and state-controlled news outlets for their dissemination of lies about the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter emerged as the most abused platform and also the one with the least oversight. While the company cooperated with McCaul's probe, it did not remove any of the propaganda posts identified by the congressional investigators.\n\nFacebook also allows several Chinese state-controlled propaganda organs to freely post misinformation, potentially reaching millions of Americans. These outlets include China Daily, Xinhua, and CGTN, all of which are leading purveyors of Chinese government-approved propaganda. Facebook received the highest grade awarded, a C+, due to its efforts to specifically inform readers they are consuming state-funded information. It still permits these outlets to freely post content on its site, however.\n\nYouTube demonstrated similar failures. It does not block communist officials and news outlets or remove their materials. YouTube does, however, attempt to fact-check and police this content for inaccuracies. \"YouTube does label videos by CCP propaganda outlets, but the labeling is inconsistent,\" according to the report. In many cases, YouTube failed to label CCP content as propaganda and did not provide viewers with complete information about the biased nature of these videos.\n\nThe investigation is part of a broader effort by congressional leaders to address China's influence operations in the United States and to protect American audiences from foreign propaganda. The findings of the investigation highlight the need for social media companies to take a more active role in policing suspect content and to apply their policies consistently, regardless of the source of the information.",
    " Title: North Carolina Governor Signs Controversial Election Law Overhaul\n\nArticle:\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has signed into law a contentious bill that significantly alters the state's election laws. The new legislation mandates government-issued photo IDs at polling stations, reduces the early voting period by one week, and eliminates same-day registration.\n\nIn a statement released by his office, McCrory, a Republican, referred to the changes as \"common sense reforms,\" asserting they would safeguard the \"integrity\" of the voting process. In a 95-second YouTube video, McCrory emphasized that residents can obtain a free photo ID at local Department of Motor Vehicle offices across the state. He also assured that the photo ID requirement would not be enforced until the 2016 elections to allow ample time for preparation.\n\nDemocrats and minority groups have expressed concerns that the new law will restrict voting access, particularly for minorities, the elderly, and youth. The American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups have pledged to challenge the changes in court.\n\nThe Reverend William Barber, president of the state chapter of the NAACP, told The Associated Press, \"It is a trampling on the blood, sweat, and tears of the martyrs\u2014black and white\u2014who fought for voting rights in this country.\" Barber added, \"It puts McCrory on the wrong side of history.\" The NAACP chapter has already filed a legal challenge to the measure.\n\nNPR's Kathy Lohr reports that McCrory signed the bill into law just weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a section of the Voting Rights Act that required North Carolina and other states to secure federal approval before altering their election laws. The Justice Department is reportedly considering filing a lawsuit against the new North Carolina law, similar to the ongoing case in Texas.",
    " Title: Turkey Threatens Europe with Refugee Influx as Syrian Offensive Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has warned Europe of a potential influx of 3.6 million refugees if European leaders label Turkey's ongoing military operation in Syria as an \"occupation.\" The threat was made during a speech to officials from his ruling AK Party, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Turkish military operation, which began on Wednesday, involves airstrikes and artillery fire targeting U.S.-allied Kurdish forces on the ground. The operation follows President Donald Trump's surprise announcement last week of a U.S. troop withdrawal from a part of Syria that had been reclaimed in a long-drawn war against the Islamic State.\n\nTrump's decision was framed as a move to hand over the responsibility of containing IS to the Turks. In defense of his decision, Trump later stated that the Kurds did not contribute significantly to the U.S. efforts during World War II.\n\nGround fighting against the extremist group, led by Kurdish forces, has been ongoing since 2014. These forces form the bulk of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed organization responsible for governance and the containment of resurgent IS fighters and overcrowded IS prisons in the area.\n\nTurkey has historically refused to aid the Kurdish forces, viewing them as allies to dissident Kurds in the country. Erdogan has pledged to clear the area of \"terrorists,\" with the stated aim of facilitating the return of Syrian refugees in Turkey to their homes. However, numerous U.S. officials have expressed skepticism about this promise.\n\nAnkara has long vowed to eliminate the Kurdish militia presence along its border in northern Syria, which it considers a security threat and indistinguishable from a separate Kurdish terrorist group waging a counterinsurgency within Turkey.",
    " Title: A Change in Perspective: A Republican's Reflection on Trump's Presidency\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, it is not uncommon to find individuals who, like myself, did not support Donald Trump during the Republican primaries. As a resident of deep blue Oregon, I did not vote for him in the general election. However, as the results began to roll in on election night, I found myself as excited as if my favorite football team, the Minnesota Vikings, had just won the Super Bowl.\n\nThe excitement was not just for Trump, but also for the Republican Party's stronghold on both chambers of Congress, and their control of numerous governorships and state legislatures. As reported by CBS News, the Republicans have expanded their power in state capitols to their strongest levels in decades. Thirty-three of 50 governors are now Republican, a 95-year high not seen since 1922. Daily Kos notes that Republicans control both legislative chambers in 32 states, while Democrats only control the legislature in 13 states, one of which is Oregon.\n\nOne aspect of Trump's supporters that I completely missed was the representation of a large, unrepresented segment of our fellow Americans: people living in the Rust Belt whose jobs had left, and all of the other Americans who were suffering silently with no spokesperson, no lobbyists, and no one advocating on their behalf. A year ago, Peggy Noonan called them \"the unprotected.\" They found an advocate in Trump.\n\nI am cautiously optimistic about Trump's presidency. For me, the big victory was the Supreme Court nominees being selected by someone other than Hillary Clinton. The rest is gravy. I'm still concerned by some of the same things regarding Trump's temperament and character, but I've been pleasantly surprised by many of his conservative appointments and actions so far.\n\nIt is important to hold Trump accountable for his actions and words, but accountability needs to be in proportion and fairly applied. I am amazed at the hypocrisy on the left in some of the most virulent criticism. A great deal of the outrage expressed in the recent women's marches was about despicable comments Trump made in 2005. He also has a history of credible allegations of sexual assault and unwanted advances. He should be held accountable for all of that. But are these same people marching okay with what Bill Clinton was accused of doing? Rape and sexual assault. And were they also okay with Hillary's unrepentant suppression of any of the women who said they had been victimized by her husband? Where were the protest marches against the Clintons?\n\nWrong is wrong, no matter who does it. I am more than okay with holding Trump accountable for the things he does and says, but that accountability needs to be in proportion, and it needs to be fairly and evenly applied. In the meantime, it would be nice for everyone to take a step back from the overreaction to Trump's victory and to actually give him a chance.\n\nDan Lucas, an independent researcher and policy advocate, is past editor of the conservative blog Oregon Catalyst.

    " Title: The Washington Post Suspends Reporter Felicia Sonmez Amidst Controversy Over Kobe Bryant Tweet\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, The Washington Post suspended national political reporter Felicia Sonmez on Monday, following her tweet about a 2016 Daily Beast article detailing the sexual assault allegations against the late Kobe Bryant. The reason behind the suspension remains unclear, with conflicting reports emerging about the exact cause.\n\nOn Sunday, Sonmez shared a link to the aforementioned article on her Twitter account. The post sparked a wave of backlash, with Sonmez receiving a barrage of abusive and threatening messages. In response, Sonmez defended herself, stating that she was merely sharing a well-reported and accurate story.\n\nSonmez, who herself is a survivor of sexual assault, posted a screenshot of her inbox, which showed a message from a reader calling her derogatory names and threatening her. The Washington Post, however, deemed Sonmez's tweets as displaying \"poor judgment\" that \"undermined the work of her colleagues.\"\n\nErik Wemple, The Post's media critic, interviewed Sonmez and determined that the paper's suspension was \"misguided.\" Wemple questioned, \"What did Sonmez do to deserve this brushback? She tweeted out a very good story from the Daily Beast.\"\n\nManaging editor Tracy Grant issued an ambiguous statement, stating, \"National political reporter Felicia Sonmez was placed on administrative leave while The Post reviews whether tweets about the death of Kobe Bryant violated The Post newsroom's social media policy.\" However, the Post's social media policy does not seem to suggest any violation on Sonmez's part.\n\nMatthew Keys, citing an unnamed source, reported that Sonmez was suspended because the screenshot she tweeted out revealed the full names of those who had written her. However, Sonmez told Wemple she had not heard this explanation from the Post. In fact, it was Sonmez who was doxxed, with her address being posted online, causing her to check into a hotel out of fear for her safety.\n\nIt is also unclear how Sonmez's tweets \"undermined the work of her colleagues,\" as The Post has published numerous stories on Bryant's death over the past day or so, and Sonmez's social media posts do not appear to have interfered with that coverage.\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on why Sonmez was suspended, The Post's communications manager, Molly Gannon, replied, \"We do not have anything additional to share.\"\n\nBy suspending Sonmez, The Washington Post has found itself at the center of a distracting newsroom drama that could have been avoided had it treated one of its employees with a little more respect.",
    " Title: Senate Democrats Accuse President Trump of Potential Responsibility for 3D-Printed Gun Proliferation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange on Tuesday, Senate Democrats accused President Donald Trump of potential responsibility for the proliferation of 3D-printed guns, should his administration fail to block a Texas-based company from posting blueprints for the firearms online.\n\nSen. Ed Markey (D-MA) stated, \"The ball is in his court \u2014 he has a chance to prevent this from happening. Donald Trump will be totally responsible for every downloadable, plastic AR-15 that will be roaming the streets of our country if he does not act today.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) added, \"These guns are a menace. The failure to ban them will mean blood on the hands of officials who have that responsibility. I call on the Trump administration now to do the right thing.\"\n\nThe senators and other Democrats in Congress are pushing legislation that aims to block Defense Distributed, the company, from posting the prints and looks to ban \"untraceable\" guns that don't have serial numbers or metal parts that can be crafted using 3D printers.\n\nThe issue has sparked a wave of legal action after the State Department and the company agreed to a settlement last month, allowing Defense Distributed to post the files once again after a years-long legal battle that spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations. The company and its founder, Cody Wilson, argue that their right to move forward with the plans to post the files online falls under constitutionally-protected free speech.\n\nPresident Trump, in a Tuesday tweet, said he's looking into the issue and has spoken to the National Rifle Association about it. However, Sen. Blumenthal stated, \"He can blame it on anyone if he wants to save face, but it's his doing. It's his responsibility, and the blood's going to be on his hands. It's that simple and stark.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer predicted that nothing would come of Mr. Trump's tweet, calling it \"a dollar short and a day late.\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described last month's decision as \"a death warrant for countless innocent men, women, and children.\"\n\nThe senators' statements come as the company started posting the prints last week, and the issue has sparked widespread concern over the potential for increased gun violence and the ease with which these firearms can be produced and distributed.",
    " Title: Consumer Health Plan Ratings Delayed in Most States, Stirring Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy, consumer health plan ratings, a key component of the Affordable Care Act, are yet to be published in most states. The ratings, provided by an independent company, are intended to allow consumers to evaluate health plans based on treatment outcomes, service, and consumer satisfaction.\n\nThe lack of published ratings has been a source of concern for healthcare providers and consumers alike. Garry Maisel, CEO of Western Health Advantage, an ObamaCare-approved provider, expressed his dismay, stating, \"Consumers deserve to know what is unrated versus what has been around a long time and has a good quality rating.\"\n\nThe controversy came to light last week in California, where Western Advantage, Kaiser Permanente, and Sharp Health Care, all highly-rated providers, complained that the state failed to post their ratings due to opposition from lower-rated plans.\n\n\"When a quality rating is available, consumers should have access to it,\" said Maisel. \"If I was a consumer, I would want to know [if] the plan I pick, the network of providers I access care through, was just put together or has been around a long time.\"\n\nThe National Council on Quality Assurance (NCQA) rates almost every health plan available nationwide on treatment, prevention, and customer service. Each category is scored on a scale of 1 to 5, and plans are ranked from best to worst. Eighty percent of insurers nationwide are rated by the NCQA. However, only eight states are posting those ratings, with the rest, including the 34 state health care exchanges managed by the federal government, not publishing them.\n\n\"It is extremely important consumers have this rating information,\" said health care analyst Betsy McCaughey. \"Otherwise, choosing a plan on these exchanges is just a shot in the dark.\"\n\nSome states, such as Colorado, Minnesota, and Oregon, do post ratings. The Oregon website lists the quality score right next to price, allowing for an apples-to-apples comparison. Maisel suggested that other states should follow Oregon's example.\n\n\"Value is a combination of price versus quality,\" he said. \"It's like an equation, like a teeter-totter. So put it out there! Price is out, so put the quality rating out there and let the consumer decide who they want to buy based on value.\"\n\nUnder the law, the health care exchanges have until 2016 to display quality-of-care data. The delay in publishing these ratings has raised concerns about transparency and consumer empowerment in the healthcare marketplace.",
    " Title: Tucker Carlson Questions Double Standard in Investigation of Alleged Hate Crimes and Mob Violence\n\nArticle:\n\nIn his Tuesday program, Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson questioned the differing standards applied to investigations of alleged hate crimes and mob-related vandalism and destruction of property. The host pointed to the Department of Justice and FBI's investigation into the alleged hate crime at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama compared to the response to alleged crimes committed by mobs.\n\nCarlson argued that the apparent conclusion was that the \"mob\" was an arm of the Democratic Party's establishment. He questioned the authenticity of the noose incident involving NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace, citing the lack of evidence and the history of similar incidents turning out to be hoaxes.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018, there were six high-profile so-called hate crimes involving nooses, all of which were heavily promoted by the media. Each of these incidents was later found to be a hoax. The host also mentioned the Jussie Smollett case.\n\nCarlson questioned the FBI's and Federal prosecutors' response to the Bubba Wallace incident, stating that 15 agents were sent to investigate a provocation against a millionaire racecar driver, while mobs were roaming the country unchallenged by law enforcement, burning things, and assaulting people.\n\nThe host concluded that the FBI's and Federal prosecutors' response to the Bubba Wallace incident was a hoax, as there was no hate crime in Wallace's garage. He also questioned the FBI's lack of investigation into the vandalism of the statue of American patriot, Francis Scott Key, in San Francisco, where the words \"Kill the colonizers. Kill whitey\" were spray-painted on the empty pedestal.\n\nCarlson argued that the double standard in the investigation of hate crimes and mob violence raises questions about the relationship between the Democratic establishment and the mob. He pointed to the City of Philadelphia's Mayor and District Attorney, who have been supportive of mob actions, while threatening to prosecute citizens who tried to protect the statue of Christopher Columbus.\n\nThe host concluded by stating that the Democratic politicians do not fear the mob because they control it, and the mob operates with their permission. These are their foot soldiers, and this is their militia.",
    " Title: Justice Department Files Lawsuit Against Ferguson to Overhaul Police and Court Operations\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against the city of Ferguson in an attempt to forcibly overhaul the city's troubled police and court operations, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced Wednesday. The decision comes after city leaders sought to revise a long-negotiated settlement, citing prohibitive costs of executing such a deal.\n\n\"There is no cost for constitutional policing,\" Lynch said late Wednesday.\n\nThe Justice Department's action follows a public announcement last month of a tentative agreement that the attorney general described as \"both fair and cost-effective.\" However, the City Council rejected the consent decree approved by their own negotiators on Tuesday, leaving the Justice Department with no choice but to file a lawsuit.\n\nLynch stated that the residents of Ferguson have endured civil rights breaches that established a pattern and practice of racially biased policing. \"I think the city of Ferguson had a real opportunity to step forward here,\" a visibly disappointed attorney general said. \"Instead, they have chosen to step in the past.\"\n\nFerguson Mayor James Knowles signaled earlier Wednesday that the city was ready to take on the Justice Department in federal court. He defended Ferguson's unanimous decision to revise the agreement by removing language from the agreement that local leaders asserted mandated big raises for police officers.\n\nLocal leaders also sought to free the city from its obligations under the agreement should Ferguson seek to shutter the police department altogether and enlist another agency to provide public safety services.\n\n\"The ball is in their court,\" Knowles said at a hastily called news conference in Ferguson. \"We're sitting and waiting to talk. If they want to threaten legal action, then that's what they're threatening.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in a Missouri federal court, alleging local law enforcement conduct routinely violated the Constitution. The city of 21,000 has a budget of about $14 million and is facing about $2.8 million in debt after the August 2014 police shooting death of an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, sparked weeks of sustained and often violent protests.\n\nThe Justice Department's investigation, which concluded nearly a year ago, found that the city's police and municipal court unfairly targeted African-American residents, who make up about 70% of the population. The city's troubles and similar problems in cities across the country prompted a national discussion on police tactics and the appointment of a special White House panel.\n\nIn Ferguson, city leaders hosted a series of emotionally-charged hearings this month on whether it should ratify the tentative Justice settlement. Some residents urged the City Council to reject the deal and take their chances in court, while others favored the agreement as a way for the city to regain the trust of a wary African-American community.\n\nCity Council member Wesley Bell said members of the council felt it was important to present their concerns about the costs of implementing the deal. He said the amendments to the agreement were not meant to be a \"take it or leave it\" offer.\n\n\"We hope the Justice Department is willing to sit down and talk to us and continue negotiations,\" Bell said. \"If this case goes to court, it will not be because of the city of Ferguson.\"\n\nProponents of the Justice agreement noted that fighting a legal battle would be costly and could prove more expensive in the long-term than settling now. Knowles disputed that notion Wednesday, saying the city's analysis shows \"the agreement, as it currently stands, will cost more to implement than it would be to fight a lawsuit.\"",
    " Title: Analysis: Trump Administration's Afghanistan Peace Deal and Lessons for Future Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent seven-day'reduction in violence' agreement between the United States and the Taliban has sparked discussions about the future of Afghanistan and the lessons that can be learned from this deal. The agreement, which includes the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners, has been met with mixed reactions, but it is important to examine the implications of this deal and the lessons it offers for future negotiations.\n\nThe deal, which may not be sufficient to prevent the Taliban from regaining control of the country, has raised concerns about the explicit language used in the agreement. The Americans, it seems, should have been more precise in the terms of the treaty, particularly regarding the duration of the violence-reduction period and the conditions for prisoner releases.\n\nOne of the contentious issues in the deal is the prisoner swap, which was carried out without the consent of the Afghan government. This has been a point of contention, as the Afghan government is responsible for holding Taliban prisoners. The Trump administration should have anticipated this problem or managed it more effectively beforehand, as the Taliban has long demanded a large prisoner release before negotiations.\n\nThe deal, however, marks a significant achievement for the Trump administration, as it has managed to accomplish in its first term what the Bush and Obama administrations were unable or unwilling to do over two terms each. The deal, while not perfect, is a step towards ending American involvement in the war, which has been a contentious issue for many years.\n\nThe politics of the moment should not overshadow the fact that ending American involvement in the war is the right thing to do. The war in Afghanistan has been long and difficult, with many American soldiers losing their lives in a land whose tribes make it difficult to govern and whose mountainous terrain makes it nearly impossible to conquer.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent deal between the United States and the Taliban offers valuable lessons for future negotiations. The explicit language used in the agreement should be clear and unambiguous, and the conditions for prisoner releases should be carefully managed to avoid controversy. The deal, while not perfect, is a step towards ending American involvement in the war, and credit should be given where credit is due. The Trump administration has managed to achieve what previous administrations were unable or unwilling to do, and it is time to move forward and focus on rebuilding and stabilizing Afghanistan.",
    " Title: Deadly Shooting at Annapolis Newspaper: Five Killed, Suspect in Custody\n\nA man identified as Jarrod Ramos, 38, of Laurel, stormed the newsroom of the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, on Thursday, killing at least five people and injuring several others. The suspect, who had a long-running feud with the newspaper, was taken into custody after a minute-long response from police officers.\n\nAccording to Acting Police Chief William Krampf of the Anne Arundel County Police Department, the victims include Capital Gazette assistant editor Rob Hiaasen, 59, Wendi Winters, 65, Rebecca Smith, 34, Gerald Fischman, 61, and John McNamara. Smith was a sales assistant, and the others were journalists.\n\nKrampf stated that the attack was a targeted one on the Capital Gazette. The suspect, Ramos, reportedly brought a defamation lawsuit against former staff writer and columnist Eric Hartley and then editor and publisher Thomas Marquardt in 2012. In 2015, Maryland's second-highest court upheld a ruling in favor of the Capital Gazette and a former reporter who were accused by Ramos of defamation.\n\nRamos, who had an account on Twitter to defend himself, wrote in his bio that he was suing people in Anne Arundel County and \"making corpses of corrupt careers and corporate entities.\"\n\nPhil Davis, a crime reporter for the Capital Gazette, was among those who survived the attack. He was hiding under his desk with other newspaper employees when the shooter stopped firing. Davis described the newsroom as looking \"like a war zone.\"\n\nPolice are treating the shooting as a local incident with no links to terrorism. Law enforcement officials are investigating the scene, recovering what they thought might have been an explosive device, and are in the process of securing Ramos's Maryland residence and obtaining search warrants.\n\nCapital Gazette runs multiple newspapers out of its Annapolis office, including one of the oldest newspapers in the United States, The Gazette, which traces its origins back to 1727. The company, part of the Tronc Inc media group, publishes newspapers in and around Annapolis, home of the U.S. Naval Academy.\n\nThe shooting has drawn the attention of media groups, including Reporters Without Borders, which stated it was deeply disturbed by the events in Annapolis. U.S. President Donald Trump and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders have expressed their condolences and support for the victims and their families.\n\nJimmy DeButts, an editor at the Capital Gazette, tweeted that he was devastated, heartbroken, and numb. \"I'm in no position to speak, just know @capgaznews reporters & editors give all they have every day. There are no 40-hour weeks, no big paydays - just a passion for telling stories from our community,\" he wrote.\n\nOne of the group's flagship papers, The Capital, plans to publish a Friday edition. \"I can tell you this: We are putting out a damn paper tomorrow,\" reporter Chase Cook wrote on Twitter a few hours after the shooting.",
    " Title: Former Governor Mitt Romney Calls for Comprehensive Strategy Against Islamic State, Urges Caution on Refugee Admissions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a commentary published in The Washington Post, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney has called for a more aggressive approach to the Islamic State, urging the West to wage war on the extremist group to \"eradicate it once and for all.\" Romney, a Republican, criticized President Barack Obama's strategy, stating that an air campaign is not sufficient and that a comprehensive strategy is needed to defeat the Islamic State.\n\nRomney argues that the Islamic State, which he describes as a \"cancer that metastasized\" during Obama's presidency, requires a ground war, not just air strikes. He calls for the president to consult with the best military minds from the United States and NATO to construct a comprehensive strategy that integrates efforts with regional allies such as the Kurds, Turks, Saudis, Egyptians, and Jordanians.\n\nIn addition, Romney has expressed concern over the influx of refugees from the Middle East, particularly young men, into the West. He writes, \"The West must stop the insanity of welcoming hundreds of thousands of people from the Middle East without knowing who exactly they are.\" He suggests that while women, children, and the elderly should be accepted, \"thousands upon thousands of single young men\" should not.\n\nThe call for caution on refugee admissions comes in the wake of reports that a Syrian refugee, whose passport was found near one of the Paris attackers, had been registered as a refugee in several European countries last month.\n\nRomney also criticized Obama's assertion that the advance of the jihadists had been \"contained,\" stating that it was clearly proven wrong. He urged the president to take \"meaningful steps to defend us and our allies.\"\n\nRomney further emphasized the need to \"secure the safety of our homeland and preserve our democratic values.\" He argued that the job of defeating the Islamic State must begin \"by identifying the enemy,\" and that the West will not defeat it if it is afraid to call it by its name. He stated, \"These heinous acts of terror are waged by radical Islamists: jihadists. And the Islamic State represents the branch of this ideology that currently poses the greatest threat.\"\n\nRomney concluded by acknowledging that the broader Islamic world will play a critical role in this war, and that the West must work closely with Muslim nations to defeat the Islamic State and preserve democratic values.",
    " Title: Democrats Weigh Trade-Off: Bolton for Biden in Impeachment Trial\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Democrats are reportedly considering a potential trade-off in the ongoing impeachment trial: calling Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, as a witness in exchange for former National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe move, if it materializes, could provide Democrats with their much-desired opportunity to hear from their top witness, Bolton, while potentially offering the Bidens a platform to respond to allegations against them.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown, among others, has expressed openness to the idea, stating that hearing from Hunter Biden would be \"fine\" as long as it allows for the hearing of key witnesses. However, recent reports suggest that Democrats are now seriously considering the trade-off, with the potential for either a Biden to testify in the Senate chamber.\n\nThe decision, like much of the impeachment saga, is driven more by politics than a desire for new evidence. According to a Washington Post report, Democrats believe that having either Biden testify could backfire on President Trump and the Republican Party, providing a platform for the Bidens to counterattack and portray Republicans as overly focused on damaging a potential 2020 presidential rival.\n\nHowever, this strategy may not be in Democrats' favor. Bringing either Biden into the Senate chamber could be politically advantageous for Trump. The Bidens have been under scrutiny for their roles in Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and public opinion polls suggest that the American public is unsympathetic to their involvement.\n\nMoreover, the impeachment trial could be a difficult exercise for the Bidens, with the White House and Republicans likely to exploit personal scandals and Hunter Biden's role at Burisma. A majority of Americans view Hunter Biden's role in Burisma as bad judgment, with half believing he should return the money he earned while there and 27% believing his actions were illegal.\n\nThe potential political fallout for the Bidens, and the Democrats more broadly, is a significant concern. Sen. Chris Coons, a Biden supporter, seemed to goad Republicans into calling him, stating, \"If you want to give Joe Biden an opportunity to sit in the well of the Senate and answer the question, 'Do you think the president acted appropriately?' go right ahead.\"\n\nHowever, the presence of four Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate trial could complicate matters. With their own reasons to undermine the frontrunner, some candidates have publicly criticized Hunter Biden's appointment to the Burisma board. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, for instance, has stated that \"the issue here is what the president is doing.\"\n\nThe impeachment trial offers Biden a political advantage on the campaign trail, as some of his opponents will be sequestered for the trial. By participating in the trial, Biden could potentially lose this advantage.\n\nThe bigger question is what Democrats stand to gain from the trade-off. Public sentiment about impeachment is largely set, and John Bolton is likely to corroborate what is already known about Trump's actions. The truth is, no matter how skillfully the Democrats try to protect the Bidens in the trial, there is only so much they can do to shield them from potential damage.\n\nIn the end, the trade-off may not be worth the risk for Democrats. The impeachment trial could be a political car wreck for both the Bidens and the Democrats, and it may be wiser to accept that the only one who can hang Trump is himself. S.E. Cupp, host of \"S.E. Cupp Unfiltered\" on CNN, offers this perspective.",
    " Title: California Voters Approve Sentence Reduction for Thousands of Prisoners, Reject Abolition of Death Penalty\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in California's criminal justice system, voters have approved a ballot initiative that modifies the state's three-strikes law, potentially releasing thousands of prisoners who could appeal their sentences. However, a proposition to abolish the death penalty in the state was rejected.\n\nThe revised three-strikes law eliminates the mandatory 25 years-to-life sentence for a third felony, if that crime is nonviolent. This change could affect as many as 3,000 prisoners, sparking concerns from supporters of the original law.\n\nMark Klass, the father of Polly Klass, a 12-year-old girl who was brutally murdered in 1993, expressed relief that the man convicted of the crime will remain on death row. Klass, who has been a vocal advocate for the death penalty, believes that the worst offenders, such as child killers and serial murderers, should be removed from society.\n\nOn the other hand, the death penalty remains in California, despite the rejection of Proposition 34, which aimed to replace capital punishment with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Former Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti, who had joined forces with the ACLU and a former head warden of San Quentin prison to abolish the state's death penalty, argues that the death penalty does not serve as a crime deterrent.\n\nThe cost of housing death row inmates and paying for their appeals has been a significant concern, with the state spending an estimated $4 billion over the years. Tuesday's vote, while keeping the death penalty, indicates a growing opposition to the practice, according to Garcetti.\n\nWhile Californians rejected Proposition 34, they did vote to change the state's three-strikes law. Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley asserts that the changes will not result in the release of a large number of prisoners, and that repeat offenders will still serve time proportionate to the crime committed.\n\nAdam Gelb, director of the Public Safety Performance Project at the Pew Center on the States, notes that California previously had the nation's harshest three-strikes law. He believes the vote to revise it signifies a growing tiredness among the public of spending money on nonviolent offenders serving long prison sentences. Gelb suggests that this could lead to reforms in other states' three-strikes laws as well.",

President Obama will officially announce Mr. Hagel's resignation, first reported by The New York Times on Monday, during a White House briefing later this morning.\n\nOver the past two years, Secretary Hagel has played a crucial role in managing an intense period of transition for the United States Armed Forces, including the drawdown in Afghanistan, the need to prepare our forces for future missions, and tough fiscal choices to keep our military strong and ready.\n\nA senior administration official stated, \"Over nearly two years, Secretary Hagel has been a steady hand, guiding our military through this transition, and helping us respond to challenges from [the Islamic State] to Ebola.\" The official added that Hagel began discussing his departure with the President in October, given the natural post-midterms transition time.\n\nThe official further noted that a successor to Mr. Hagel will be named \"in short order,\" and until then, the secretary will remain in his post. Mr. Hagel submitted his resignation Monday morning, and it was accepted by Mr. Obama, according to The Associated Press.\n\nA White House official told AP that Mr. Obama and Mr. Hagel \"determined that it was time for new leadership in the Pentagon.\" The President reportedly asked the sole Republican on his national security team to step down on Friday after a series of meetings over the past several weeks.\n\nMr. Hagel leaves for the next defense secretary a host of issues to confront, notably the Obama administration's military campaign against the Islamic State terrorist group. The New York Times reported that possible replacements for Mr. Hagel include Michele Flournoy, the former under secretary of defense; Sen.

    " Title: Analyzing the Rise of ISIS: A Comprehensive Look at the Factors Involved\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, the debate surrounding the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has resurfaced, with former President Donald Trump accusing his predecessor, Hillary Clinton, of having a hand in the group's formation. However, a closer examination of the historical context reveals a more complex picture.\n\nThe rise of ISIS can be traced back to a Jordanian militant named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who founded ISIS's parent organization, al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), in the early 2000s. AQI gained notoriety through its gruesome televised beheadings, with the killing of American businessman Nick Berg in 2004, and its ignition of a civil war against the Shiites in Iraq the same year. These tactics and policies remain at the core of ISIS today.\n\nThe creation of AQI was facilitated by the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, which provided Zarqawi with an opportunity to establish a presence in Iraq, as Saddam Hussein's regime had brutally suppressed all forms of opposition. AQI grew in strength in 2006, controlling much of the massive Anbar province in western Iraq, before being largely extirpated by a surge of U.S. troops and a movement of Sunni tribesmen known as \"the Awakening\" in 2008.\n\nHowever, AQI surged back as ISIS in the 2010s, due to four significant factors. The first was the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011 in response to President Bashar al-Assad's brutal repression of peaceful protests. Elements of what would become ISIS traveled from Iraq into Syria to fight against Assad, gaining strength in Syria before re-entering Iraq as a reinvigorated force in 2013.\n\nThe second factor was the role played by some of Saddam Hussein's former officer corps, who helped to professionalize ISIS as a fighting force. The Bush administration's decision to disband the Iraqi army in 2003 had pushed some Iraqi officers to join Sunni militant groups.\n\nThe third factor was the ineffective and corrupt rule of then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who marginalized Sunnis and disenfranchised them from Iraq's political process, leading many Sunnis to prefer the rule of ISIS to that of the \"Shia\" government in Baghdad.\n\nThe fourth factor was the weakness of the Iraqi army, which disintegrated as ISIS made its most dramatic advances during the first half of 2014. The Iraqi army was poorly led, poorly paid, and riddled with corruption.\n\nWhile the Obama administration did preside over the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, it is difficult to assign blame for the rise of ISIS solely to Obama or Clinton. The Obama administration was slow to recognize the threat posed by ISIS, and could have fought harder to retain a U.S. troop presence in Iraq, but the Iraqi government was unlikely to have allowed such a presence.\n\nSince the summer of 2014, the Obama administration has mounted an aggressive campaign against ISIS, but has been reluctant to engage on the ground. More could be done to support the Iraqi military against ISIS, such as deploying more U.S. Special Forces to fight alongside Iraqi forces and more U.S. forward air controllers to call in close air support.\n\nIn Syria, a no-fly zone targeted at Assad's air force and safe zones for refugees fleeing the fighting would help tamp down the death toll that plays into the hands of ISIS and other Sunni militants. Rather than making unsubstantiated claims about the creation of ISIS, it would be more productive for political leaders to focus on developing concrete policy solutions to address the ongoing Syrian and Iraqi civil wars.",
    " Title: Trump's Tax-Cut Proposals Shift Focus Away from Fiscal Discipline, Experts Warn\n\nArticle:\n\nAs President Trump's new tax-cut proposals gain traction, a significant question looms: whether the administration is prioritizing short-term fiscal stimulus over long-term fiscal discipline. The Trump team's focus on tax cuts, rather than tax reform, has raised concerns among fiscal-policy experts who argue that the nation's debt and deficits could spiral out of control.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin unveiled goals and principles for the tax overhaul on Wednesday, which include slashing corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 15 percent and reducing individual taxes. However, this shift in focus is not just a pivot for the Trump team; it reflects a larger pattern in which politicians and economists are less focused on restraining government debt and deficits.\n\nWhile Mnuchin paid lip service to the goal of fiscal discipline, the proposed tax cuts could pose a challenge to long-term fiscal discipline, especially as the economy continues to improve. Roberton Williams, an expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, notes that the federal deficits surged during and after the Great Recession but have since fallen sharply and are now near their five-decade average as a share of the US economy.\n\nHowever, even without tax cuts, the annual gap between revenue and spending appears poised to rise again, driving a parallel surge in public debt from this decade into the future, as obligations for both health-care entitlements and interest on the debt soar.\n\nThe shift in fiscal mores can be traced back to the early 2000s under George W. Bush, who pushed for big tax cuts even when the nation was at war, the economy wasn't in recession, and nonpartisan forecasts showed widening deficits as a result. Bill White, a former Houston mayor who researched and wrote a book on America's fiscal history, notes that Democrats have also shared the blame for Washington's shifting fiscal mores.\n\nEconomists and ordinary Americans alike are divided on the issue, with some arguing for fiscal discipline and others advocating for tax cuts to promote economic growth and fairness. The Trump administration's tax proposals, which include paring the number of individual tax brackets to just three, giving businesses a \"massive\" tax cut, and eliminating the estate tax, have sparked debate among economists and lawmakers.\n\nThe legislative outlook is uncertain, but longer-term, White expresses hope that forces of fiscal restraint can revive. \"I think there could be a backlash among small-government conservatives to the Trump programs,\" he says. \"And I think that many people who are Democrats understand that rising interest costs... are crowding out the possibility for investing more\" in areas like education and infrastructure.",

Tillerson referenced multiple potential threats facing the two countries, including the need to defeat ISIS on the battlefield and in the cyber realm. He also highlighted the development of a new center for combating extremist ideology, to be based in Riyadh.\n\nThe new defense deal, which includes upgrades to Saudi communications, missile defense, maritime, border, and cyber security, is expected to lower the demands on the U.S. military and strengthen Saudi security forces for the future. Tillerson stated that the arms sale would reduce the burden on the U.S. to provide the same equipment to its own military forces.\n\nTillerson also discussed other Middle Eastern countries with high levels of conflict, including Yemen, where he emphasized the need for a \"political\" solution and the importance of putting pressure on parties to come to the table and talk. On Iran, Tillerson stated that the U.S. is closely coordinating its efforts to counter Iran's extremism, particularly its support for foreign fighters, the payment of foreign fighters, and its support of militia operating in Yemen, Iraq, and Syria.\n\nRegarding potential conversations with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Tillerson stated that no plans are set, but that a conversation could happen in the future. Tillerson also highlighted the potential job creation in the U.S. from Saudi Arabia's direct investment, stating that it would bring \"hundreds of thousands\" of jobs to American workers.\n\nEarlier, Trump described the day as a \"tremendous day\" with \"hundreds of billions of investments into the United States, and jobs, jobs, jobs.\" Al-Jubeir also stated that the conversation in the U.S. and the broader Western world should change to \"one of partnership,\" while directly using Trump's own rhetoric. Al-Jubeir went on to say that the partnership between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia would \"truly change our world, and we will have truly drowned the voices of extremism, and we will have drained the swamp from which extremism and terrorism emanates.\"",

The votes, which saw the rejection of Rep. Mel Watt's (D-NC) nomination to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency and Patricia Millett's nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, have sparked renewed calls for filibuster reform from Senate Democrats.\n\nSenate Democrats, who have long advocated for a rules change to allow nominations to pass with a simple majority, view Thursday's votes as another reason to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for procedural votes on nominees. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) expressed his frustration, stating, \"Support is growing for changing the rules when they play these games.\"\n\nSen. Tom Udall (D-NM) commented, \"The pattern of 'obstruct and delay' has returned as the norm in the U.S. Senate with today's filibuster of two highly qualified nominees.\" He, along with other Democrats, argue that the need to reform the Senate's rules is evident.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has expressed a wait-and-see approach before revisiting the filibuster issue, stating he will file cloture on two additional D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals nominees before making a decision. Reid and No. 3 Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have also pledged to reconsider the Watt and Millett nominations in the near future.\n\nHowever, some Democrats, including Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), believe that the time for caution has passed. Merkley, who has long advocated for limiting the minority's power, stated, \"This will be something that can not stand as it is.\"\n\nThe Senate is set to recess for a long weekend, leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of many Democrats. Vice President Joe Biden, on Capitol Hill to swear in Cory Booker as New Jersey's new Democratic senator, called the vote on Watt a \"gigantic disappointment.\"\n\nThe GOP blocked Watt's nomination due to perceived political motivations, while Republicans objected to Millett's nomination due to concerns about ideological stacking of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Senate had been moving swiftly through a stack of nominees earlier in the week, but the talk of another rules fight so soon after the last one has caused concern among some senators, such as Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who stated, \"We've got to stop it. We've got to come together on these things and work it out, rather than have a goddamn confrontation on the floor every time.\"",

The law, which went into effect on January 1, has seen a slight increase in support, although the margin falls within the survey's sampling error.\n\nThe poll also indicates that a majority of Colorado voters, 51%, consider the law as harmful to the state's image, compared to 38% who disagree and 10% who are unsure or do not have an opinion.\n\nBreaking down the numbers by demographics, 39% of Republicans support the new law, while 76% of Democrats and 55% of independents favor it. The law is more popular among younger voters, with 78% of those aged 18-29 in support. Support decreases as age increases, with only 33% of those 65 or older supporting the law.\n\nWhile support for the law appears to be trending upwards, a majority of Colorado voters, 51%, say they have tried marijuana previously, but only 10% say they have used marijuana since it became legal last month. The current law allows Coloradans to grow up to a dozen marijuana plants in their homes. The survey reveals that more than seven in ten say they would not be bothered if one of their neighbors was growing marijuana.\n\nAnother interesting finding from the poll is that only 17% say it is very or somewhat likely they would try marijuana brownies at a gathering. Conversely, 81% would be somewhat or very uncomfortable riding in a car with a driver who has had moderate amounts of marijuana.\n\nQuinnipiac interviewed 1,139 registered voters in Colorado by telephone from January 29 to February 2. The overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.",

The law, which defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman, denies federal benefits to same-sex couples in the nine states where same-sex couples can now legally wed.\n\nIn an op-ed published online Thursday by The Washington Post, Clinton wrote, \"On March 27, DOMA will come before the Supreme Court and the justices must decide whether it is consistent with the principles of a nation that honors freedom, equality, and justice above all, and is therefore constitutional.\"\n\nClinton, who has since evolved his stance on the issue, stated, \"As the president who signed the act into law, I have come to believe that DOMA is contrary to those principles and, in fact, incompatible with our Constitution.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that the climate was different when the law was passed, stating that many supporters believed its passage would \"defuse a movement to enact a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, which would have ended the debate for a generation or more.\"\n\nHowever, he noted that the current climate is vastly different. Nine states (plus the District of Columbia) have passed laws allowing same-sex marriage, and public opinion polls show a majority of Americans think it should be legal. According to a CBS News poll conducted last month, 54% of Americans think same-sex couples should have the right to legally wed, while 39% oppose same-sex marriage.\n\nClinton lamented that same-sex couples who are legally married in the United States are still denied \"more than a thousand federal statutes and programs available to other married couples\" because of the law.\n\nIn 2009, Clinton publicly changed his stance on same-sex marriage, stating, \"I was against the constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage nationwide, and I still think that the American people should be able to play this out in debates. But me, Bill Clinton personally, I changed my position.\"\n\nIn his op-ed, Clinton wrote, \"While our laws may at times lag behind our best natures, in the end they catch up to our core values.\" He concluded by urging the Supreme Court to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act.",

The White House has expressed displeasure over the move, with unnamed officials describing Netanyahu's actions as a \"spit in the face\" of President Barack Obama.\n\nAccording to reports, the Israeli leader is expected to urge Congress to impose tougher sanctions on Iran to pressure the country to halt its suspect nuclear program. This move has reportedly been met with disapproval from the Obama administration, with the President personally demanding that Netanyahu tone down his support for new sanctions legislation.\n\nThe White House's displeasure with Netanyahu's actions is particularly pronounced among high-ranking officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry. Over the past month, Kerry has made numerous efforts on Israel's behalf on the world stage, including making dozens of calls to world leaders to oppose a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have set a time frame for the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nHowever, the Israeli intelligence chief, Tamir Pardo, has denied Kerry's claim that he contradicted Netanyahu during a January meeting by criticizing new sanctions. Pardo stated that he reiterated that \"firm pressure\" was needed to bring about meaningful compromises from the Iranian side.\n\nThe escalating tensions between the two nations have raised concerns about the future of the U.S.-Israel relationship, with some officials expressing worry that Netanyahu's actions could strain the bilateral relationship and potentially undermine Kerry's efforts to defend Israel on the world stage.",

McCain, a leading Senate voice on national security and the threat posed by Russia, also called for a special committee to delve into the issue.\n\nMcConnell noted that he sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee as an ex-officio member, and that incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer (N.Y.) will soon join him in the same capacity. McConnell also highlighted that Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the current chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. John McCain, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, will both be looking at this issue on a bipartisan basis.\n\nMcConnell made it clear that he views Russian President Vladimir Putin as more of an adversary than a friend. He noted that Russia invaded Crimea and that a group of senators recently met with a delegation from Baltic countries, who expressed their concerns about the Russians.\n\nWhen asked about the possible appointment of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who has close ties with Putin, to serve as Secretary of State, McConnell declined to comment, stating that they should wait until they get nominees.\n\nMcConnell strongly condemned allegations that Russia may have breached U.S. cybersecurity measures but cautioned against relying on leaked characterizations of the motivation behind Russian hacking, suggesting a possible partisan lens. He noted that prior to the election, the director of National Intelligence released a statement about hacking activities directed by the Russian government, but cautioned any leaks about U.S. intelligence findings \"is irresponsible, likely illegal, and potentially for partisan political gain.\"\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's spokesman, Jason Miller, dismissed efforts to investigate Russian interference in the election as coming from \"people who are bitter their candidate lost.\" Trump himself has dismissed the CIA report, calling it \"ridiculous\" on Sunday and following up on Twitter on Monday.",
    " Title: Historical Ignorance and Political Polarization: A Reflection on the Role of Education and Media\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Warsaw, during President Trump's recent speech, a poignant reference to Pope John Paul II's historic 1979 visit was made, emphasizing the impact of the Mass in Victory Square on the subsequent fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However, the response to this statement on social media was not one of understanding or reflection, but rather, a wave of assumptions that the President was fabricating or speaking irrationally.\n\nThis incident serves as a stark reminder of the extent of political polarization in today's society and the role that historical ignorance plays in fueling it. Ignorance, in this context, is not a term to be shamed or ridiculed, but rather, it is a lack of knowledge that can be filled through education and critical thinking.\n\nThe instantaneity of modern media, particularly social media and television, amplifies this problem. For instance, on the Fourth of July, NPR's Morning Edition tweeted out the text of the Declaration of Independence, only to be met with a barrage of angry responses from both the left and the right.\n\nThe intellectual framework for understanding significant events has shifted over generations, from World War II and the Cold War to the Iraq War and the War on Terror. For many millennials, this new paradigm seems to be not geopolitical events but the adventures of Harry Potter. This raises concerns about the historical literacy of the current generation and the potential consequences of this lack of knowledge.\n\nA story circulates of a general who, speaking to an audience of 20-somethings, discussed the challenges posed by the War on Terror. One individual, presuming themselves well-educated, replied that they knew the \"Gap\" in question - it was a shopping mall near their home, not the strategic location in the German lowlands where the Soviets were most likely to launch an invasion of Europe, the Fulda Gap.\n\nIn the face of these challenges, it is crucial that we strive for a greater understanding of history and the world around us. As Daniel Boorstin, a renowned historian, once noted, \"The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge.\" It is a common human foible to think we know more than we do, and to assume that when someone, particularly someone we don't agree with, says something we don't understand, the fault must lie with the speaker, not the listener.\n\nEducation, particularly historical education, breeds humility, not arrogance. It is our hope that, as a society, we can move towards a more educated and humble discourse, one that is grounded in fact and not assumptions. Only then can we begin to address the challenges we face, at home and abroad, with the understanding and wisdom necessary to overcome them.",
    " Title: Mark Halperin's Controversial Remarks on Healthcare Costs and the Nuclear Option\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with NewsmaxTV, Time magazine's Mark Halperin inadvertently exposed a tension between his axiomatic hostility to partisan power grabs and his concern for the country's fiscal health. Halperin's comments on end-of-life care and the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) have sparked controversy, as they seem to contradict his earlier statements on the importance of budgetary restraint.\n\nHalperin's remarks, while discussing the ongoing political controversy about the IPAB, inadvertently confirmed the premise of a question about the \"death panels.\" He later clarified that he was referring to the cost-cutting panel created by the Affordable Care Act, designed to cap Medicare spending growth.\n\nThe IPAB, a significant source of cost-saving potential in the Affordable Care Act, might not have a significant fiscal impact in the coming years if healthcare inflation remains low. However, if spending spikes, a panel of medical and industry experts will be tasked with cutting payments to hold spending at a manageable level, creating an incentive for providers to allocate resources wisely.\n\nThe board won't and can't directly ration services, but it, or a beefed-up version of it, will probably be the mechanism that keeps federal health spending on a sustainable trajectory without tossing seniors into the private system and letting insurers do the rationing. However, the board is currently vacant, and Republicans would have likely nullified it altogether if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hadn't invoked the \"nuclear option\" to permanently prohibit filibustering executive branch nominees (excluding Supreme Court justices).\n\nIf you care about how the country spends its healthcare dollars, as Halperin says he does, Reid's decision to go nuclear is of enormous consequence. Congress can override IPAB's recommendations, but only by replacing them with different savings of equal magnitude. If Congress wants to do away with IPAB altogether, it will have to reckon with how to finance the higher relative health spending it will be creating.\n\nRepublicans, and some Democratic IPAB opponents, characterize it as a rationing board. Most of them steer clear of \"death panel\" rhetoric. But the question for them, once it's up and running, will be, Who should be rationing these dollars instead? Should insurers do it, while pocketing a decent profit along the way?\n\nHalperin's comments have sparked debate, with some arguing that his remarks inadvertently confirmed the need for the IPAB, while others criticize his use of the term \"death panels.\" However, the underlying issue remains: the need for a cost-cutting mechanism to keep federal health spending on a sustainable trajectory.\n\nReid's decision to go nuclear for executive branch nominees has allowed for the possibility of implementing such a mechanism, and it remains to be seen how it will impact the country's healthcare spending in the long run.",
    " Title: President Trump Announces Permanent Residency Change to Florida, Citing Poor Treatment in New York\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday evening, President Donald Trump announced that he and his family have changed their permanent residency status to Florida. The President, who was born and raised in New York, expressed his love for the White House and his hope to stay there for another term, but stated that his new home will be Palm Beach, Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago Club is located.\n\n\"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, is the place I have come to love and will stay for, hopefully, another 5 years as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, but my family and I will be making Palm Beach, Florida, our Permanent Residence,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe President cited his love for New York and its people, but stated that he has been treated poorly by city and state political leaders, despite paying a significant amount in taxes. \"I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state. Few have been treated worse,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio responded to the news with tweets welcoming the President to Florida. \"He\u2019s all yours, Florida. https://t.co/9AX0q1aBkQ\" - Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) November 1, 2019. \"Don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out or whatever\" - Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) November 1, 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Elizabeth Warren accused Trump of making the move to hide tax information from New York authorities. The President's decision to change his residency comes as he faces multiple investigations and lawsuits, including one involving his tax returns. The President has long resisted releasing his tax returns, citing ongoing audits by the Internal Revenue Service.",
    " Title: Dr. Ben Carson Forms Exploratory Committee for 2016 Presidential Run, Raises Questions About Senate Bid\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked speculation and debate, Dr. Ben Carson, a renowned neurosurgeon, has announced the formation of an exploratory committee to test the waters for a potential 2016 presidential bid. The announcement was accompanied by a video outlining his reasons for considering a run, emphasizing his dissatisfaction with the current state of political leadership and his desire to bring common-sense solutions to the table.\n\nCarson's potential candidacy positions him as an anti-establishment, non-traditional candidate, aiming to appeal to voters as a voice outside the political mainstream. His strong following, built on his medical expertise and public speaking abilities, could prove a significant advantage in the race.\n\nHowever, some political analysts question whether Carson would be better served by running for a Senate seat, given the upcoming vacancy left by Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD). Jonah Goldberg, in particular, suggests that Carson might have a greater impact on the national political landscape as a senatorial candidate. Goldberg argues that, while Carson might not garner a majority of the black vote in Maryland, he could potentially do well in conservative parts of the state and even flip a safe Democratic seat in the tough 2016 election year for Republicans.\n\nDespite these arguments, Carson has shown no interest in a Senate bid, as indicated by his recent announcement. It appears that a Senate run has not even crossed his mind.\n\nThe article concludes by noting that, while Carson lacks political experience, many candidates have successfully run for a U.S. Senate without prior government service. Elizabeth Warren, for example, defeated incumbent Sen. Scott Brown (R-MA) just three years ago and is now considered a serious contender for the 2016 presidential race by progressive circles. The article suggests that Dr. Carson might want to consider these factors as he contemplates his political future.",
    " Title: CNN's Brianna Keilar Grills Kellyanne Conway on Trump's Remarks About Hillary Clinton and Paul Ryan\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tense and heated interview on CNN's The Situation Room, host Brianna Keilar pressed Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on the candidate's repeated comments about sending Hillary Clinton to \"jail\" and his attacks on House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nDuring the nearly 30-minute interview, Conway attempted to defend Trump's remarks about Clinton, initially claiming they were merely a \"quip.\" However, Trump's repeated calls for Clinton to be jailed, including at a rally in Florida on Wednesday, contradicted this assertion.\n\nWhen confronted by Keilar about these remarks, Conway again repeated her \"quip\" defense before pivoting to an attack on Clinton for \"imperiling our national security.\" As Keilar continued to press Conway to explain why Trump insists on talking about \"jailing your political opponent,\" the campaign manager stopped her.\n\n\"You're taking it literally,\" Conway said. \"You're stuck on this one thing.\"\n\nKeilar responded, \"I'm talking about what your candidate is saying, which is more important than what you are saying about this. He is saying she has to go to jail. He is not talking about she has to stand and be judged. He is saying she has to go to jail.\"\n\nConway attempted to use her rhetorical gymnastics to escape the question, listing off some of things Clinton has said about Trump, but Keilar kept hammering her. \"He is saying, if he were president, she would be in jail,\" the host said.\n\nLater in the interview, Keilar also did not let Conway get away with denying that Trump has been \"attacking\" Paul Ryan after the Republican leader said he would no longer defend the candidate. \"Come on, Kellyanne, he tweeted repeatedly. He called him weak and ineffective. So I mean, you want to give him credit for not attacking him at one rally? 'Is he done attacking the House Speaker then?'\" she asked.\n\nAs the interview progressed, Conway resorted to attacking CNN for ignoring the \"substance\" of Trump's campaign. \"You're doing a disservice to the American people by not telling them exactly everything, fully and fairly, of what one of the presidential candidates actually the only one who goes out and talks to voters on a daily basis about issues,\" she said.\n\nMiraculously, despite the tension and animosity between the two women, Conway stuck around during a commercial break, something she may have regretted when Keilar opened the next segment with accusations from a former Miss Arizona who accused Trump of walking in on her changing backstage before one of his pageants, something Trump himself bragged about doing on The Howard Stern Show.\n\nConway attempted to shift the conversation to Bill Clinton, but Keilar continued to press her on Trump's comments about Clinton. \"When does Donald Trump stop saying things like Hillary Clinton has to go to jail?\" she asked. \"You're saying this should be discussed. Why doesn't he make a pivot? Why doesn't he talk more seriously as a candidate about the issues and not upstage himself?\"\n\nConway's stated desire to focus on issues that Americans care about as opposed to decades-old comments and behavior flies directly in the face of a new report from Bloomberg Businessweek that says the Trump campaign will go all in on accusations made by women against Bill Clinton. That plan, spearheaded by campaign CEO Steve Bannon and others, aims not only to distract from Trump's own apparent history of sexual misconduct but also to depress the vote of millennial women. \"We\u2019re going to turn him into Bill Cosby,\" Bannon reportedly told Trump staffers.\n\nBy the end of the CNN interview, they had reached an impasse, and all Keilar could do was thank Conway for being \"generous\" with her time. \"Nice to be here,\" Conway replied, though it was unclear whether there was any more truth to that than to her insistence that Trump doesn't really want to jail his opponent.",
    " Title: Time's Relentless Toll: The Baltimore Riots and the Attorney General's Challenge\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the grand scheme of the universe, few forces may be as merciless as Time. It moves relentlessly, indifferent to individual pleas for slowdowns or speedups. However, it seems that Time may hold a particular grudge against Loretta Lynch, the first African-American woman to be sworn in as the Attorney General of the United States, following an unprecedented 167-day delay in her confirmation process.\n\nThe delay in Lynch's confirmation was the first sign that Time might bear a grudge against the attorney general. While it was wrong to keep her waiting so long, it is challenging to place the blame solely on Time. The delay was instigated by the Republican party, with Time serving as their tool.\n\nThe second piece of evidence that Time may be targeting Lynch is more tangible: the recent riots in Baltimore that paralyzed the city. Although Lynch had no direct involvement in the disorder, the fires that engulfed the city highlight the premature nature of her stated goal of \"improving police morale.\" The wanton destruction of property cannot be justified, but simply criticizing anarchy and praising law enforcement will not quell the unrest or bring justice.\n\nThe chaos in Baltimore is but the latest chapter in one of America's most tragic and enduring narratives. It is another example of what Martin Luther King Jr. once referred to as \"the language of the unheard.\" King's words were spoken during the summer of 1966, in the midst of the riots that ravaged much of the country. The social ills he described - poverty, police brutality, and malign neglect - persist today, nearly 49 years later.\n\nThe catalyst for the Baltimore riots was the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American man who died after being arrested by officers from the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) on April 12. By the time of his death on April 19, Gray had a broken neck. The BPD has admitted that its officers did not provide Gray with necessary medical care, but the circumstances surrounding his death remain unclear.\n\nThe fact that such a tragedy could occur, and only become a major story after the activism of peaceful protesters and the destructive actions of violent rioters, is emblematic of the problem. The fact that the BPD's reputation is such that many Baltimoreans heard Gray's story with weary outrage rather than shock or indignation is a testament to the systemic issues within the department. The fact that the BPD rank-and-file seems so comfortable with extralegal brutality, and are so accustomed to wielding it, is a further indictment of the department's culture.\n\nAttorney General Lynch's interest in finding common ground between law enforcement and minority communities is commendable, but it may have come at an inopportune time. As the fires are put out, and the state of emergency in Maryland is lifted, what Baltimore and similar communities will need is not another conversation. Finding \"common ground\" will not be what America needs from its attorney general or the Department of Justice.\n\nWhat will be needed instead is for the authorities in Baltimore, Maryland, and D.C. to stop catering to police unions that demand unchecked power in the field and endless praise from officials. What will be needed is a demonstration that the authorities take the rise of the \"warrior cop\" and police militarization seriously, and that they will no longer view the deaths of people like Gray as \"tragic.\" Suspending officers with pay who may be responsible is not enough - Lynch must make clear that she understands this, and that her predecessor's groundbreaking report on Ferguson, Missouri, was no aberration.\n\nWhat will be needed, in short, is for the people most apt to use \"the language of the unheard\" to feel that someone who matters is finally listening. And that those in public office prove with actions that they believe it when they say an African-American life is worth no less than a cop's. Now is not the time for Lynch to focus on making law enforcement happy. Now is the time for her to promote equal justice. Improving police morale can wait.",
    " Title: Grassroots Activists Express Disappointment with Republican Handling of Obamacare Repeal\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, the Democrats' strategy of outrage has been a well-known tactic, according to Jenny Beth Martin, president and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots. Martin, who has witnessed the strategy firsthand, acknowledges its unifying power, but notes the challenge of delivering on the promises made during campaigns.\n\nThe Tea Party Patriots, a group that has been vocal against Obamacare, continues to receive hundreds of responses from activists expressing their discontent with the healthcare policy. During the initial vote in May, the group made over 100,000 phone calls in 48 hours, urging the House to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. However, Martin clarified that the group is not yet in agreement with the Senate's current approach to the issue.\n\nGrassroots activists, such as Pat Daugherty, a retired university administrator from Athens, Ga., share the same frustration. Daugherty, who once marched on Washington against Obamacare, now finds herself as disillusioned with Republicans in Congress as she was during the early days of the Tea Party movement.\n\n\"Every Republican in Congress ran on repealing Obamacare,\" Daugherty stated. \"Why do we suddenly have a hard time repealing Obamacare when Republicans are in the majority?\"\n\nDaugherty, like many conservatives, expresses more disappointment with Republicans than with Democrats.\n\nDavid Zupan, who organized Tea Party groups in Ohio against the Affordable Care Act, shares similar sentiments. He attributes the policy for the increase in healthcare costs and the closure of his technology support business. Before the law, he paid $910 per month to insure him and his wife, with a $750 annual deductible. When he renewed his policy last year, the rates had increased to $2,845 per month, with a $3,500 deductible.\n\nZupan had hoped to confront Senator Rob Portman over the recess to demand a full repeal. However, his efforts were thwarted as he was unable to locate Portman during the recess. Zupan, like many other activists, is dissatisfied with the current state of the Senate bill, believing that any changes made will not improve it.\n\n\"Nothing they're going to do to this bill is going to make it better,\" Zupan concluded.\n\nThe growing discontent among grassroots activists could potentially impact the political landscape, as the pressure for a full repeal of Obamacare remains a significant issue for many conservative voters.",
    " Title: GOP Accuses Whistleblower of Democratic Ties, Alleges Coordination with Schiff's Staff\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, the Republican National Committee's Rapid Response Director, Steve Guest, has accused the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the House investigation into President Donald Trump's phone conversation regarding U.S. aid to Ukraine, of being a Democratic operative with ties to the Democratic Party and the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nGuest, in an interview with a media outlet on Thursday, claimed that the whistleblower is a Democrat who had a professional relationship with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's staff, and coordinated and took guidance from them. He also alleged that Schiff lied about this relationship and his staff recommended attorneys for the whistleblower.\n\nAccording to Guest, the whistleblower's lawyers have worked for former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and have donated to Joe Biden's presidential campaign. One of the whistleblower's attorneys, he added, is allegedly a member of the #Resistance, an anti-Trump movement.\n\nGuest's claims come amidst a growing controversy surrounding the Ukraine scandal, in which President Trump is alleged to have solicited Ukraine's president to investigate Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings to influence the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday, President Trump questioned the impartiality of the whistleblower, stating, \"The Whistleblower's facts have been so incorrect about my 'no pressure' conversation with the Ukrainian President, and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a Democrat Candidate, that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly. This is no Whistleblower.\"\n\nThe allegations against the whistleblower have been met with skepticism by some, including Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the whistleblower, who dismissed the bias allegations as \"seriously?\" in an interview with The Washington Examiner.\n\nHowever, Zaid and fellow attorney Andrew Bakaj acknowledged that their client had met with presidential candidates from both parties, but not as candidates. In a statement, they clarified that their client had never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party, and had come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials, not as candidates.\n\nThe controversy deepened this week with a report in The Washington Examiner that inspector general Michael Atkinson, in an Aug. 26 letter, wrote the anonymous whistleblower who first made the charge against Trump, showing \"some indicia of an arguable political bias...in favor of a rival political candidate.\" The report also alleged that under questioning from Republicans during last Friday's impeachment inquiry, Atkinson revealed the whistleblower had a significant tie to one of the Democratic presidential candidates currently vying to challenge President Trump in next year's election.\n\nMeanwhile, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is facing heat over a September meeting his staff apparently had with the whistleblower. When Schiff was grilled by MSNBC in September about whether he had spoken to the whistleblower, he replied that his committee had \"not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\" However, The New York Times reported that a House Intelligence Committee aide did, in fact, have contact with the whistleblower \u2013 contact that Trump has argued was illegal.\n\nThe GOP's Guest also told the media outlet he believes the Democrats' impeachment push \"is a textbook coordinated Democrat political smear straight out of the pages of the Russia hoax and the phony Brett Kavanaugh playbook.\"",
    " Title: Obama Campaign Strategy Shifts Focus to Non-Issues in Debates, Diverting Attention from Economic Concerns\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the recent presidential debates, the Obama campaign has been criticized for focusing on trivial matters rather than addressing the pressing economic issues at hand. The strategy, which has been seen in the debates' aftermath, involves the Obama campaign highlighting seemingly insignificant comments made by Mitt Romney during the debates and using them to create a narrative that detracts from the economic challenges facing the nation.\n\nDuring the first debate, Romney stated that every dollar of government spending should be measured by whether the program is \"so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it.\" In response to Romney's comments on government spending, the Obama campaign launched television ads mocking the cuts to public broadcasting, focusing on the character Big Bird, rather than addressing the tough economic issues discussed during the debate.\n\nAt the second debate, Romney's use of the phrase \"binders full of women\" in response to a question about gender pay equality was met with a swift response from the Obama team, who sought to ridicule the Governor's choice of words and tie them to a non-existent \"war on women.\" Despite CNN acknowledging that Romney had hired large numbers of senior-level women and had a history of promoting women as executives, the Obama campaign's response shifted the focus away from the economic issues at hand.\n\nDuring Monday's foreign-policy debate, Romney's comment that the Navy has fewer ships today than at any time since 1917 was met with Obama's one-line retort, \"Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets.\" The Obama campaign capitalized on this response, buying the search term \"bayonets\" on Twitter, and the media declared it a line that would \"live forever.\"\n\nThe debates have shown that the Obama campaign is adept at capitalizing on small issues to divert attention away from significant problems, such as the economy, deficit, and entitlement spending. This strategy may play well for Romney, as a recent battleground poll revealed that more than two-thirds of Americans name pocketbook issues like the economy and jobs as their top concerns.\n\nAfter the Hofstra debate, polls found that Romney beat Obama on the issue of who can better handle the economy, 58 percent to 40 percent. While the Obama administration continues its barrage of attack ads on Romney's wealth, involvement with Bain, and shipping jobs overseas, they are losing ground with voters who want to hear about policies that can get the economy going again.\n\nRomney capitalized on the enthusiasm gap for Obama's economic policies by offering a five-point plan that would create 12 million new jobs. Romney positioned himself as the man with the plan, offering solutions for the middle class, and highlighted Obama's record by citing stats of the mounting federal debt, the decline in household incomes, a growing entitlement state, and soaring gas prices.\n\nAs the election nears, these are the policy topics voters should be debating and sharing with each other, not colorful memes and rhetoric about Big Bird, binders, or bayonets. Whether President Obama's reelection strategy of diverging from four years of hostility to job creators is successful remains to be seen. But the next generation deserves a serious discussion of serious issues rather than political efforts to trivialize them.",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Hillary Clinton Leading Donald Trump by 13 Points in Head-to-Head Match-Up\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll released by CNN/ORC, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is leading presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by a significant margin of 54 percent to 41 percent. The poll, conducted from April 28 to May 1, was released on Wednesday.\n\nThe polling was concluded before Senator Ted Cruz of Texas announced the suspension of his campaign, which led to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus declaring Trump as the presumptive GOP nominee. Trump's victory in Indiana on Tuesday effectively knocked Cruz out of the race.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont defeated Clinton in Indiana, but Clinton remains the favorite to clinch the Democratic nomination. The poll also revealed that 56 percent of voters have an unfavorable view of Trump, compared to 41 percent who reported a favorable view. Clinton had an even 49 percent/49 percent favorable/unfavorable split.\n\nVoters believe Clinton would handle climate change, foreign policy, education, health care, the income gap between rich and poor, immigration, and terrorism better than Trump. However, Trump is perceived to have a better handle on the economy.\n\nIn the survey, more than half of both Clinton and Trump voters said their vote was more about opposition to the other candidate than support for their preferred candidate. Fifty-one percent of Clinton voters said their vote was more about opposing Trump, compared to 48 percent who said it was more about supporting Clinton. On the other hand, 57 percent of Trump voters said their choice was more about opposition to Clinton, compared to 43 percent who said it was more support for Trump.\n\nOhio Governor John Kasich, who is still in the GOP race, leads Clinton head-to-head by 7 points, 51 percent to 44 percent. Sanders outperforms Clinton in head-to-head match-ups against the two remaining Republicans. Sanders leads Trump by 16 points, 56 percent to 40 percent, and he leads Kasich by 4 points, 50 percent to 46 percent.\n\nSanders had a 61 percent/33 percent favorable/unfavorable split among voters, while Kasich had a 54 percent/29 percent split. Cruz's overall favorability, meanwhile, was worse than Trump's. The Texas senator had a 37 percent/56 percent favorable/unfavorable split.\n\nClinton beat Cruz by 10 points, 52 percent to 42 percent, and Sanders beat him by 18 points, 57 percent to 39 percent. The poll suggests that Clinton is currently in a stronger position against both Trump and Cruz, while Sanders also performs well against the remaining Republicans.",
    " Title: Johnson's Victory: A Triumph for Brexit, but a Shift in Economic Policy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic head-to-head debate on BBC in London on December 6, 2019, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn faced off. The election results, with Johnson's Conservative Party securing a majority, are likely to ensure the completion of Brexit, but they also signal a significant shift in economic policy.\n\nFive years of Johnson's leadership, often referred to as 'BoJo', have outlasted five years of Corbyn's, but the victory is not a triumph for traditional conservatism. The election's outcome, much like the election of Donald Trump in the United States, can be attributed to a force that has been underestimated - fiscally liberal social conservatism.\n\nJohnson's colossal victory was driven by several factors. Some voters were deterred by Corbyn's anti-Semitic remarks and hard-left economic policies, while others were motivated by the desire to complete Brexit. However, despite these powerful factors and his personal appeal, Johnson felt it necessary to add another element to secure the outright majority - a spending spree.\n\nHe campaigned against the Conservative party's alleged post-financial-crisis \"austerity\" policies and promised to increase spending. Despite Corbyn's radical left-wing policies, Johnson made no attempt to argue for the benefits of minimal government intervention in the economy, instead painting a picture of growth and economic security derived from government spending.\n\nJohnson's fiscal liberalism, like Trump's, is linked to social conservatism. He promised increased spending on infrastructure, schools, and the National Health Service, while also pledging not to raise taxes and to decrease the budget deficit. He also promised to implement policies such as longer jail sentences for violent criminals, more police, and fewer limits on searching suspects, as well as limiting immigration through an Australian-style points system.\n\nIn order to win, Johnson had to contest seats in traditional Labour constituencies, and free-spending promises may have been the only way to win those voters over. However, the cost of this victory is a significant shift in economic policy, with the British economy moving towards a more left-leaning direction.\n\nThough Johnson's government is preferable to a Corbyn-led one, the parameters of British economics have taken a significant step to the left. If a nominally conservative party lacks the courage or the communications skills to sell conservative economics when it can boast of having reduced unemployment to a 44-year-low and when its opponent promises to implement unreconstructed socialism, it bodes ill for those on either side of the Atlantic who wonder whether any party will ever even gesture in the direction of sane fiscal policy again.",
    " Title: U.S. Economy Adds 162,000 Jobs in July, Unemployment Rate Drops to 7.4 Percent, but Labor Force Participation Falls\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint report released on Friday, federal economists reported a sluggish growth in the U.S. economy, with the addition of 162,000 jobs in July and a decrease in the unemployment rate from 7.6 percent to 7.4 percent. The jobs count, which fell short of analyst expectations, follows Wednesday's dismal news of the economy growing by only 1.7 percent in the second quarter. The federal economists also revised the first-quarter growth down to 1.1 percent.\n\nThe 7.4 percent unemployment rate marks the lowest of President Barack Obama's presidency, a level not seen since December 2008. However, the unemployment rate is based on a separate survey, which relies on data from a survey of households, rather than the jobs number, calculated via a survey of employers' payrolls. The household survey, which has a larger margin for error than the payroll count, estimated 227,000 more people were employed in July compared to the previous month.\n\nThe falling unemployment rate is attributed to both positive and negative factors, as the additional 37,000 people who left the labor force in July also contributed to the rate's decline. Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, commented, \"The report, like many of late, contains good news and less good news. Most of the decline in unemployment was due to more people getting jobs, but part of it was due to a slight fall off in the labor force, a signal of not-too-strong labor demand.\"\n\nThe slow job growth leaves 11.5 million people unemployed, with another 8.2 million part-time employees seeking to add more hours to their work week. Among the unemployed, 4.2 million have been unsuccessfully seeking work for 6 months or more.\n\nIn the past year, the unemployment rate has decreased by 0.8 percent, with the count of officially unemployed persons falling by 1.2 million. The job reports are currently being used as talking points in the fiscal debate between the White House and Republicans, but they are a key indicator for the Federal Reserve as it considers when to scale back its efforts to stimulate the stalled economy.\n\nFed Chairman Ben Bernanke has stated that the central bank is watching for signs that it should scale back a series of monthly multi-billion dollar asset purchases aimed at driving down long-term interest rates and sparking new growth. Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics, predicted that the report will push the Fed to ramp down its efforts when the bank's policy committee next convenes in September.\n\nWhile the employment report and GDP data may not spur action in Congress, they add further urgency to the newly reinvigorated economic debate between President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans.",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Reaffirms U.S. Commitment to NATO, Baltic Allies amid Tense U.S.-Russia Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a visit to Estonia, Vice President Mike Pence reaffirmed the Trump administration's commitment to NATO and its Baltic allies on Monday, pledging to confront the perceived threats and intimidation from Russia. During a meeting with the presidents of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, Pence emphasized the U.S.'s solidarity with the region in the face of mounting pressure from Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPence's visit coincided with escalating tensions between Washington and Moscow, as Putin recently expelled 755 U.S. diplomats in response to new sanctions legislation that the Trump administration is expected to sign. The legislation, which codifies financial and diplomatic sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and meddling in the U.S. presidential election, is seen as a legislative check on President Trump's ability to unilaterally cancel sanctions.\n\nThe tit-for-tat sanctions reflect the strained relationship between Trump and Putin, exacerbated by unproven allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow in the 2016 U.S. election. Pence, however, emphasized the U.S.'s commitment to holding Russia accountable for its actions and called on European allies to do the same.\n\n\"Under President Trump, the United States will continue to hold Russia accountable for its actions,\" Pence said. \"We hope for better days and better relations with Russia, but recent diplomatic action taken by Moscow will not deter the commitment of the United States to our security, the security of our allies, and the security of freedom-loving nations around the world.\"\n\nPence's message reinforced Trump's support for NATO's Article 5, which pledges mutual defense for all member nations and is the heart of the alliance. Some NATO allies have sought reassurance of the U.S.'s continued commitment to the pact following Trump's previous statements labeling NATO \"obsolete\" and pushing member nations to pay a larger share for their own defense.\n\nThe former Soviet states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined NATO in 2004 as part of NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe, which alarmed Russia. Pence emphasized the importance of a strong and united NATO, stating, \"We stand together, here and across the world, because we know that a strong and united NATO is more necessary today than at any point since the collapse of communism a quarter-century ago, and no threat looms larger in the Baltic states than the specter of aggression from your unpredictable neighbor to the east.\"\n\nPence also met with NATO troops from Britain, France, and the U.S. stationed in Estonia. The alliance has deployed approximately 4,000 troops and military hardware in the three Baltic states and Poland to counter Russia's buildup in the region.\n\nPence's European tour also includes stops in Georgia and Montenegro, two other countries facing strong pressure from Russia.",
    " Title: Trump's First Week with Republicans in Congress: A Shotgun Marriage with Ambitious Agenda and Unconventional Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the first week of the new administration, the relationship between President Trump and Republicans in Congress can be likened to a shotgun marriage - an unlikely pairing brought together by circumstances, trying to make it work but with questions about whether they can pull it off.\n\nDuring his speech before House and Senate Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday, President Trump was his usual braggadocious self, savoring his underdog victory in the state, listing his \"record\" number of executive orders, then running through his ambitious to-do list. He also put his best Trumpian foot forward, throwing in a bit of self-deprecation, praising his congressional cabinet picks, and joking with Mitch McConnell, the taciturn Senate majority leader from Kentucky.\n\nRepublican lawmakers were generous with standing ovations, applause, and laughs \u2013 though silent on a couple of touchy points. Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) described the meeting as \"a really warm meeting with the president.\" He expressed optimism, though he couldn't put his finger on why, exactly. \"You can't describe it, you just know it when you see it, and it's a feel as much as anything else.\"\n\nRepublicans sense a huge opportunity with their control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. At the retreat, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) laid out a \"big, bold\" 200-day agenda that covers Affordable Care Act repeal-and-replace, tax reform, regulation roll-back, the debt ceiling, paying for the wall, and \u2013 added at the president's insistence \u2013 infrastructure.\n\nThe ambitious agenda is not unprecedented. Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, a creature of the Senate, had a \"massive agenda\" in the 1960s \u2013 from civil rights laws to his antipoverty program \u2013 but he also knew how to deal with Congress, says James Pitney, a congressional expert at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif.\n\n\"[Trump] has all of LBJ's ego, without any of LBJ's legislative skill,\" says Prof. Pitney. Johnson \"knew the mechanics. He knew the personalities. Trump does not.\"\n\nRepublicans plan to use a special budget process to pass their two top priorities \u2013 Obamacare repeal and tax reform \u2013 by majority vote and without the help of Democrats. However, the issues are complicated, and views differ among Republicans about how best to address them. Pitney calls the agenda \"a clash between reality and fantasy.\"\n\nFor instance, GOP lawmakers can't agree on whether to actually repeal taxes that support Obamacare or keep them in place until a transition time is over. And that's not even getting to the details of a replacement, for which there is no consensus \u2013 even after lawmakers held a special session on healthcare at the retreat.\n\nAt a joint press conference with Speaker Ryan on Thursday, Senator McConnell was confident that they would accomplish their two highest priorities, but pointed out that the Senate has about 1,200 Trump appointees to confirm. And then there's the announcement of a Supreme Court nominee next week. \"We're big in the personnel business,\" he said.\n\nThe House doesn't have to worry about that, nor does it have to contend with the Senate's special rules and much slower pace. That's something that the new president is confronting. In his speech, he complained that the Senate has not yet confirmed his full cabinet. \"They are not quick with the pen on signing these people.\"\n\nTrump has a businessman's understanding of how Congress works, says John Feehery, former spokesman for Dennis Hastert, the longest-serving Republican speaker of the House. \"They go in, they give money, they don't get what they want, they get frustrated. He's on a steep learning curve.\"\n\nLikewise, Republican lawmakers are trying to figure out how to work with a president who is unlike any they've encountered before. As Republicans huddled at their secure hotel in Philadelphia on Wednesday, Trump surprised them with tweets about a voter fraud investigation.\n\n\"This is going to be an unconventional presidency,\" said Speaker Ryan at the press conference the next morning. \"I think we're going to see unconventional activities like tweets and things like that, and I think that's just something that we're all going to have to get used to.\"\n\nThe voter fraud tweet seemed to roll off the backs of lawmakers \u2013 and several say they just ignore the tweet eruptions and try to focus on policy.\n\n\"I don't see any evidence [of widespread fraud],\" said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House oversight committee. His committee has no plans to investigate, \"but the president has 100,000 people at the Department of Justice [and] if he wants to do an investigation, have at it.\"\n\nIn another surprise, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration was apparently going to review reopening \"black site\" prisons and undoing restrictions on interrogations. Lawmakers put their foot down and said there would be no return to torture. The White House denied the Times story, also reported by the Associated Press, saying the leak \u2013 not from the administration \u2013 was an old memo from the transition period.\n\nStill, don't expect Republicans to \"actively challenge\" Trump in the near future, says Professor Pitney. They're afraid of primary voters \u2013 Trumpsters \u2013 and of the president's wrath, he and other observers say.\n\nMeanwhile, they want to prove to Americans that they can get the job done, and to do that, they need to work with each other. \"This Congress is going to be the busiest Congress we've had in decades, maybe ever,\" the president told his Republican colleagues. But seasoned politicians such as Senator Risch point to the slow nature of Congress and the complexities of the issue. With tasks such as replacing Obamacare, \"We are going to have to be patient,\" he said.",
    " Title: Perry and Clinton Clash Over Voter ID Laws and Wall Street Regulation in Presidential Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, former Texas Governor Rick Perry has escalated his criticism of Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, accusing her of alienating voters by criticizing voter ID laws in Texas. Perry, who often advocates for states' rights, argued that the voter ID laws in Texas are supported by the state's residents.\n\nDuring an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Perry responded to Clinton's speech last week where she criticized voter ID laws like those in Texas. Perry, who signed the strict voter ID law in 2011, stated that Clinton was \"way outside the norm of ridiculous\" in her call for easier voter ID laws.\n\nIn a speech in Texas on Thursday, Clinton criticized Perry, along with three other Republican presidential hopefuls, for their support of voter ID laws and opposition to early voting. The next day, Perry accused Clinton of \"taking on\" Texas voters for supporting the voter ID law.\n\nClinton's rapid-response team, Correct the Record, responded to Perry's criticisms, stating that Republicans like Perry are trying to deny citizens the fundamental right to vote under the fictional specter of voter fraud. The team also accused Perry of signing a law that was intentionally written to discriminate against minority voters.\n\nIn addition to the voter ID debate, Perry also took aim at Wall Street banks during his campaign announcement speech. He criticized the so-called too big to fail banks and stated that if that was populism, he was proud to be a populist on that issue. Perry also stated that he would regulate Wall Street, but added that he believed the Dodd-Frank regulatory reforms signed by President Barack Obama went too far and were harming community banks.\n\nPerry launched his second straight presidential campaign on Thursday with an upbeat, muscular speech in an airplane hangar outside Addison, Texas. Perry also made a big coup for his campaign by signing influential conservative activist Sam Clovis to head his Iowa operation.\n\nThe back-and-forth between Perry and Clinton highlights the ongoing debate over voter ID laws and Wall Street regulation in the 2016 presidential race. Both candidates have strong support among their respective bases, and the race is expected to be closely contested.",
    " Title: American Public's War Skepticism and North Korea: A Persistent Concern Amidst Escalating Tensions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Chicago Council of Foreign Affairs (CCFA) has released a new poll revealing that 75 percent of Americans view North Korea as a critical threat to the United States, a significant increase from two years ago. This heightened sense of threat comes amidst President Donald Trump's historically low approval ratings, with 62 percent of respondents expressing decreased confidence in his ability, and 61 percent expressing unease about his handling of North Korea.\n\nThe poll also indicates broad bipartisan support for increased sanctions against North Korea, with 76 percent favoring such measures, despite their limited effectiveness over the past decade-plus. Furthermore, 68 percent of Americans support extending sanctions to Chinese companies working with North Korea.\n\nRecent reports suggest that North Korea has successfully miniaturized a nuclear warhead for missile delivery, overshadowing diplomatic progress. North Korean missile tests are followed by successful U.S. missile defense tests. The poll, for the first time in 30 years, found a majority of Americans supporting military action if North Korea attacked South Korea.\n\nThe CCFA poll also indicates that large majorities believe North Korea should not be allowed to keep its nuclear weapons. However, North Korea is unlikely to accept any arrangement where it cannot keep at least some of its weapons. The U.S. has taught the world some lessons about this in recent decades, and Pyongyang has been paying attention.\n\nThe U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, following claims of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) by the George W. Bush administration. No WMD program was found, but the Iraq war did have a knock-on effect on proliferation. By the end of 2003, Libyan dictator Moammar Qaddafi indicated an interest in voluntarily relinquishing his WMDs and WMD programs.\n\nThe U.S. helped depose Qaddafi in 2011, an event that made a powerful impression on any regime that may have been entertaining the idea of avoiding American military action by disarming. Indeed, it created a strong incentive to acquire WMDs and maintain a formidable military force as a deterrent against U.S. aggression.\n\nFor all the hype about the North Korean regime, Pyongyang has been a relatively rational actor. The regime has adeptly manipulated various regional powers and the U.S., allowing it to survive even as communism collapsed nearly everywhere else.\n\nThe U.S., by contrast, has survived despite often acting in a less than rational fashion. The ocean buffer that sandwiches America has given us space to do that, as has our massive military superiority. From Vietnam to Afghanistan, the U.S. faces few real existential consequences for its ill-conceived actions.\n\nTrump ran on a platform of questioning America's security commitments around the world. While he has since embraced much of America's role as world policemen, other countries remain understandably skeptical. This has led South Korea and even Japan to consider developing their own nuclear arsenals\u2014a development that, counterintuitively, could go a long way in improving the prospects of peace in the region.\n\nAmerican opinion, meanwhile, is working against peace. Coupled with Trump's sinking approval ratings, the relatively widespread approval of a more aggressive approach in Korea could prompt Trump to drop any attempts at negotiation. Diplomacy is easy to mock, after all. War comes with a rally-'round-the-flag effect. This post was updated to include new comments by President Trump.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Proposes Changes to Obamacare, Insurers Cautiously Optimistic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at stabilizing the individual health insurance market, the Trump administration has proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) that will be published in the Federal Register on Friday, with a public comment period ending on March 7. Final rules are expected to be issued in March or April. Insurers must decide by early May what kinds of health plans they will offer in 2018.\n\nSenator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, hailed the proposals as \"important first steps to rescue a collapsing Obamacare individual market.\"\n\nHowever, insurers have expressed caution, stating that the proposed rules, while helpful, would not provide a solution if, in a few weeks, Republicans introduce legislation to repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as the requirement for most Americans to have coverage.\n\nChristopher W. Hansen, the president of the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society, voiced concerns that tighter restrictions on special enrollment periods could \"cause problems for cancer patients,\" potentially delaying treatment and reducing their chances of survival.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is also implementing changes that could weaken incentives for people to obtain insurance. The tax agency announced it would accept and process tax returns even if taxpayers failed to indicate whether they had coverage, qualified for an exemption, or were paying the penalty for going without insurance.\n\nThe individual mandate, requiring most Americans to have insurance, was to be enforced through the tax system. The IRS stated that the requirement was \"still in force until changed by Congress.\" However, it remains unclear how the IRS will use its authority to enforce this requirement.\n\nIn the rules proposed on Wednesday, the Trump administration has allowed states to determine whether insurance plans have enough doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers to serve patients. This move is intended to attract more insurers into the market. Additionally, insurers could refuse to provide new coverage to consumers who failed to pay premiums owed in the previous year. If an insurer terminates coverage for non-payment of premiums, it could require consumers to pay all past-due premiums owed to that insurer before restarting coverage.\n\nLastly, insurers would be allowed to sell health plans covering a smaller share of expected costs. The administration argues that this would provide consumers with \"more coverage options,\" but acknowledges that some consumers could see increases in their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs.",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Preference for Republican-Led Congress in Upcoming Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nA new poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal, NBC News, and Annenberg has revealed that a majority of likely voters prefer a Republican-controlled Congress in the upcoming midterm elections on Nov. 4. The survey, which was conducted Oct. 10-16 among 1,172 voters, found that 49 percent of likely voters favor a Republican-led Congress, compared to 44 percent who prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress.\n\nThe poll also showed that Republicans have an advantage among all registered voters, with 45 percent preferring a GOP-led Congress, compared to 43 percent who prefer a Democratic-led Congress. This is the first time in five weeks that the GOP has come out ahead, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe findings appear to reinforce polling results from last week that showed that Democrats are less interested in the election than Republicans. The survey also found that among those most interested in the election, 51 percent favored the Republicans, compared to 44 percent for Democrats. Lower-interest voters support the Democrats by 52 percent, compared to 37 percent.\n\n\"Today's survey is yet more evidence that Democratic voters are tuning out the midterms,\" The Wall Street Journal said. \"Democrats carried a 10-point lead among low-interest voters, who the party is trying to reach and motivate with vigorous turnout operations across the country. Republicans carried a 10-point lead in the new survey among voters who said they were highly interested in the election.\"\n\nThe findings come as pundits continue to predict that the Republicans have the best chance of taking control of the Senate. Last week, Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, projected that the GOP could take up to eight seats. \"Our projection remains a five- to eight-seat Republican gain in the Senate, and with less than three weeks to go, we would much rather be holding the cards Republicans have been dealt versus the ones dealt to the Democrats as both sides play for a Senate majority,\" Sabato said in his \"Crystal Ball\" analysis.\n\nThe Washington Post also predicted last week that Republicans will take control of the upper chamber, and explained its analysis by looking at the most competitive races. As of Sunday, The New York Times election model gives Republicans a 69 percent chance of winning the Senate.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's low approval ratings are believed to be a major factor dragging down the Democrats' chances. His support among women, in particular, has dropped sharply in battleground states where Democrats are already lagging among male voters.",
    " Title: Trump's Response to Mueller Report: Changing the Subject Amidst Calls for Accountability\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the release of the Mueller report, President Donald Trump has found himself in a familiar pattern of response, rather than entering a new phase of his presidency as some might suggest. Instead of moving on from the investigation, the president has resorted to his time-tested strategy of lying, attacking, and changing the subject.\n\nThe first two phases of Trump's response were evident as he and his surrogates claimed that the president had been completely exonerated, despite Mueller's explicit statement that he did not make such a judgment. They then accused the media and Democrats of conspiring to bring down the president.\n\nHowever, it is the third phase, the president's attempt to change the conversation, that is most noteworthy. Trump has a history of surviving scandals by sparking new controversies, which eclipse the old ones, creating a presidency of serial scandals.\n\nSince the release of the Mueller report, Trump has attempted to change the topic in two ways. First, he has advocated for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to be declared unconstitutional, a move that could strip healthcare benefits from tens of millions of Americans with no plan for alternative coverage. Second, he has escalated his anti-immigrant rhetoric and threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border, a self-destructive move that would harm millions of Americans and undermine cooperation with Mexico.\n\nCongress' role in this situation is crucial. They must investigate Trump, but they must also be strategic about it, as argued by legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe. Instead of going along with the president's wishes, they need to stay focused on obtaining a full copy of the Mueller report and making its contents known to the public.\n\nThe 2016 election integrity issue is not about relitigating the election, as some Republicans claim. It is about establishing the principle that America has a president, not a king, and that the president is bound by the rule of law. It is about returning accountability to American public life after years of congressional Republicans shirking their constitutional duty to hold the executive branch to account. It is about finding out exactly how American national security was compromised in 2016, and why the president and his surrogates are so keen to pretend it wasn't.\n\nPerhaps that's why Donald Trump won't just release the report and instead wants to change the subject. Democrats shouldn't let him. The full truth of the Mueller investigation needs to be revealed to the public for the sake of American democracy and the rule of law.",
    " Title: Unlikely Republican Support for Pelosi's Speaker Bid Amidst Democratic Opposition\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi faces a challenging climb to secure the necessary support from her own party to reclaim the Speaker's gavel in January, she is receiving an unexpected source of support: Republicans.\n\nPelosi, who previously held the Speaker position between 2007 and 2011, the last time Democrats held the majority in the House, is facing a growing rebellion from her own members. A number of Democrats have signed a letter pledging not to support her for Speaker on the House floor. Fox News confirmed on Thursday that at least 17 House Democrats, including incumbents and incoming members, have signed onto a document stating they will not support Pelosi for Speaker. A Democrat familiar with the effort says they are trying to add more names before the letter is publicly released.\n\nIf all those Democrats vote against Pelosi on the floor, Pelosi would not have the votes for Speaker. To secure the gavel, Pelosi will first need to garner a majority of the Democratic caucus in internal leadership elections, then go on to win an absolute majority of the House.\n\nIn the face of an increasingly tight race, a number of Republicans are proposing the idea of offering Pelosi their support in the House, thinking it could benefit them in the long term. President Trump tweeted after the midterms that if she struggled, \"perhaps we will add some Republican votes.\" Although it was not clear if this remark was serious or tongue-in-cheek.\n\nOn Thursday, Republican Tom Reed suggested that if Pelosi embraced a bipartisan package of rules reforms that would make it easier for members to get legislation to the floor, he could support her. \"A Democratic candidate who embraces these rules reforms, I will stand with,\" he told CNN. \"I am so frustrated with this institution being a top-down driven organization... it is time to change this, and if Nancy Pelosi is the only one that's there, I'm open to it.\"\n\nReed conceded that there would be \"significant backlash\" from other Republicans. However, other Republicans have also suggested backing her bid, as it could help them in the long term.\n\nRepublican strategist Chris Wilson suggested on \"Fox and Friends\" on Friday that Republicans should back Pelosi. \"Republicans are not going to have a speaker of the House. So why not try and... put her back in that chair?\" he asked.\n\nPelosi, at a press conference on Thursday, dismissed the idea that she would need Republican help to win the gavel. \"I intend to win the speakership with Democratic votes,\" she later said, adding that she had \"overwhelming support\" in her caucus.\n\nIn 2016, Pelosi fended off a leadership challenge from Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio. During a recent appearance on Fox News' \"Cavuto,\" Ryan said, \"I don't think this is a done deal yet\" in terms of Pelosi becoming Speaker again. Ryan also said he \"hopes somebody does\" challenge Pelosi.\n\nOn Friday, Pelosi met for 45 minutes with Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, who is mulling a prospective leadership challenge. Other Democrats have been more supportive, with House Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., telling Fox News on Friday that \"she has the experience.\"\n\n\"She's someone who gets things done. We don't need someone with a learning curve,\" Jayapal said, adding that \"we need to deliver some real wins pretty quickly.\"",
    " Title: Justice Department Referral of McCabe to Federal Prosecutors for Potential Criminal Investigation Raises Questions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Justice Department's inspector general has referred the findings of its report on former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to federal prosecutors in Washington for potential criminal investigation. The Washington Post reports that the referral, which occurred some time ago, followed the inspector general's conclusion that McCabe had lied to investigators or his own boss, then-FBI Director James B. Comey, on four occasions, three of them under oath.\n\nThe referral to the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office does not guarantee that McCabe will be charged with a crime. Michael R. Bromwich, McCabe's lawyer, stated in a statement that they were advised of the referral within the past few weeks. Bromwich added, \"We are confident that, unless there is inappropriate pressure from high levels of the Administration, the U.S. Attorney's Office will conclude that it should decline to prosecute.\"\n\nThe inspector general's report, which Attorney General Jeff Sessions used as the basis for firing McCabe last month, was leaked almost as soon as it was completed. Similarly, news of McCabe's criminal referral was also leaked on Thursday, though the referral was made weeks ago or even longer.\n\nThe report specifically charged that McCabe \"lacked candor\" with internal investigators at the agency and concluded he was not authorized to disclose to reporters the existence of an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nFormer FBI Assistant Director Frank Figliuzzi, on MSNBC Thursday, called the criminal referral on such a matter \"unprecedented.\" Figliuzzi stated, \"If this is indeed true, that the charge that's being referred or recommended is for a 'lack of candor' during an internal inquiry, I can not recall that ever happening in my 25-year FBI career.\" Figliuzzi added that approving an unauthorized leak is something that could rise to the level of criminal referral.\n\nThe referral and the potential criminal investigation of McCabe have raised questions about the political motivations behind the move and the precedent it sets for future cases. The Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney's Office have not yet commented on the matter.",
    " Title: Melania Trump's Speech at RNC 2016: Similarities to Michelle Obama's 2008 DNC Address Spark Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nThe opening night of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland was marked by a series of unexpected events, culminating in a plagiarism controversy surrounding Melania Trump's speech. The speech, delivered on Monday, bore striking similarities to Michelle Obama's address to the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\n\nA significant section of Trump's speech, focusing on the values she and her husband share, appears to have been directly lifted from Obama's comments on the same subject eight years ago. In 2008, Republicans criticized Michelle Obama for not being \"proud\" of her country; however, they are now defending her words when they are coming from Melania Trump.\n\nThe plagiarism controversy capped a chaotic first day of the Republican National Convention. The day began with Trump's campaign attacking popular Ohio Governor and former presidential challenger John Kasich for not attending the convention. By afternoon, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was rallying people outside, only to be interrupted by a popular comedian asking the fringe radio host to \"have sex with my wife.\"\n\nLater in the day, a fight erupted on the convention floor, with anti-Trump delegates demanding a roll call vote before the RNC got underway. At another point, Rep. Steve King was on MSNBC suggesting that white people are superior to any \"sub-groups.\" By the evening, speaker after speaker recalled in detail the attacks on the U.S. compound in Benghazi.\n\nMelania Trump took the stage and, in many instances, repeated almost line-for-line what Michelle Obama said in 2008. Here are the similarities:\n\n\"From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect,\" Melania said. \"They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily life. That is a lesson that I continue to pass along to our son, and we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.\"\n\n\"Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you're going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you do not know them, and even if you do not agree with them. And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generation. Because we want our children\u2014and all children in this nation\u2014to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.\"\n\nBefore the convention, Team Trump told CNN that Melania spent five to six weeks working on the speech. She told Matt Lauer on Monday afternoon that she had \"as little help as possible\" writing it.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not acknowledge the plagiarism allegation when it first surfaced. \"In writing her beautiful speech, Melania's team of writers took notes on her life's inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking,\" spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement late Monday. \"Melania's immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it such a success.\"\n\nBy 1:30 a.m., the campaign finally addressed the plagiarism, and attacked Hillary Clinton. \"This is once again an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, she'll... take her down,\" campaign manager Paul Manafort told CNN. \"It's not going to work.\"\n\nBy 7:30 a.m., Chris Christie offered a more qualified defense of Melania's speech when the Today show asked him if it was plagiarism. \"Not when 93 percent of the speech is completely different than Michelle Obama's speech,\" he said. \"They expressed some common thoughts.\"\n\nThe idea that any Republican would share \"common thoughts\" with Michelle Obama would have been shocking to the GOP until last night. Republicans went ballistic when the future First Lady told a crowd of voters in Feb. 2008:\n\n\"For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.\"\n\nThe Obamas subsequently explained that what she meant was that she was thrilled to see Americans turning out to vote, but the meme that the Princeton and Harvard Law grad was a crypto-black militant had stuck.\n\nTo take but one example from Glenn Beck in 2012: \"This is who they are. They're anti-colonialists. They believe America has oppressed the rest of the world.\"\n\nTrump himself used Joe Biden's plagiarism scandal to question Obama's running mate in 2008, telling Wolf Blitzer, \"You know, he's also been involved in pretty big controversy like plagiarism in college and various other things. That's a pretty big statement. So perhaps you change over a period of time. But when you plagiarize, that's a very bad statement.\"",

The film, which aired on CNN and has been criticized for its portrayal of SeaWorld, alleges that the company takes baby whales from their mothers and keeps them in small aquariums, causing psychological trauma and aggression.\n\nHowever, SeaWorld has responded to these allegations, stating that they have not separated orcas from their mothers in 35 years and have no plans to do so in the future. The company also claims that much of the film is deceitful and that the things described in the documentary did not happen.\n\nOne of the most controversial scenes in \"Blackfish\" is a mournful cry of a mother whale whose baby was taken from her. However, SeaWorld claims that the \"baby\" in question was actually an adult with its own offspring, and that the scene was manipulated with added sound effects that are not even appropriate to a killer whale.\n\nAnother allegation made in the film is that captive orcas have droopy dorsal fins, which is said to indicate that the whales are miserable. However, whale expert Ingrid Visser states that killer whales in the wild also have collapsed dorsal fins.\n\nSeaWorld claims that its orcas are happy and that they have a good relationship with their trainers. However, as \"Blackfish\" points out, it is difficult to know if the orcas are truly content, as they cannot communicate their feelings.\n\nOne of the most serious allegations made in the film is that captive orcas die young. However, SeaWorld points out that they have a 50-year-old orca living at one of their parks, and that their orcas' life parameters are the same as those of orcas in the wild.\n\nThe documentary has sparked protests and calls for the release of orcas into the wild. However, SeaWorld argues that releasing orcas into the wild would not be beneficial for the animals, as they are not adapted to living in concrete tanks.\n\nLori Marino, a biologist who appears in the film, states that it is cruel to keep orcas in tanks where they have to perform \"stupid pet tricks.\" However, SeaWorld argues that their parks and zoos are often the only way people learn about nature, and that ticket sales fund education and conservation efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over the treatment of orcas in captivity is complex and emotional. While \"Blackfish\" has raised important questions about the welfare of these animals, SeaWorld argues that much of the film is misleading and that their orcas are well-cared for. The controversy continues to rage on, with both sides presenting compelling arguments.",
    " Title: Trump Discusses CNN Correspondent, Mueller Investigation, and Foreign Policy in Fox News Sunday Interview\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on Fox News Sunday, President Donald Trump addressed a range of topics, including the behavior of CNN correspondent Jim Acosta, his appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, and foreign policy concerns regarding North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan.\n\nThe president criticized Acosta's behavior during a recent press briefing, stating that if he misbehaves, he would either be thrown out or the news conference would be terminated. Although a judge recently ordered that Acosta's revoked White House press pass be returned, Trump warned that Acosta's actions could lead to his removal.\n\nTrump also discussed his appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting Attorney General, stating that he was unaware of Whitaker's past remarks about the Mueller investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia when he appointed Whitaker to replace Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice.\n\nIn the interview, Trump also shared his thoughts on this month's elections, his written responses to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and foreign policy issues. He expressed solidarity with the mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, stating that the U.S. was \"ill-prepared\" to absorb the caravan of migrants traveling through Mexico towards the U.S. border. Trump also urged Democrats to \"approve Border Security & Wall NOW!\"\n\nIn other tweets on Sunday, Trump expressed his opinion on the 2018 Florida Senate election, stating that if he had not \"put a spotlight\" on the election, GOP Senate candidate Rick Scott would have lost. Trump also shared some advice he received from former President Barack Obama regarding North Korea, stating that Obama had identified North Korea as the biggest problem the country faced.\n\nTrump also discussed his foreign policy towards Saudi Arabia, stating that while he had imposed heavy sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia, he considered Saudi Arabia an ally. Trump also mentioned Pakistan, stating that he had ended the $1.3 billion annual aid to Pakistan because they did not do anything for the U.S.\n\nFinally, Trump expressed regret for not visiting Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day, stating that he was extremely busy on calls for the country and had assumed that a visit to the American cemetery in Paris would suffice. Trump stated that he would visit the cemetery virtually every year.",
    " Title: DEA and ATF Collaborate on Monitoring Gun Show Attendees with Automatic License Plate Readers, ACLU Reveals\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a revelation that has sparked controversy and raised privacy concerns, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has disclosed that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has been tracking the license plates of millions of cars belonging to American citizens, with a particular focus on gun show attendees.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by the ACLU through the Freedom of Information Act, officials from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) collaborated on plans to monitor gun show attendees using automatic license plate readers (ALPRs). An email from April 2009, partially redacted, states that the DEA Phoenix Division Office is working closely with the ATF on \"attacking the guns going to [redacted] and the gun shows, to include programs/operation with LPRs at the gun shows.\"\n\nThe government redacted the rest of the email, but the ACLU concluded that these agencies used ALPRs to collect information about law-abiding citizens attending gun shows. An ALPR cannot distinguish between people transporting illegal guns and those transporting legal guns, or no guns at all; it only documents the presence of any car driving to the event. Mere attendance at a gun show, it appeared, would have been enough to have one's presence noted in a DEA database.\n\nIn response to inquiries about the document, the DEA stated that the monitoring of gun shows was merely a proposal and was never implemented. The ACLU, however, had rationally concluded, based on the scrap of information left unredacted in the document, that gun show monitoring was underway.\n\nThis is not the first time that the government has used ALPRs to target the constitutionally protected right to assemble. The ACLU's disclosure comes amidst growing concerns about government surveillance and privacy rights.\n\nInterestingly, the Department of Justice's own surveys of prison inmates show that criminals do not obtain their firearms from gun shows. It is intriguing how the ATF, specifically the Phoenix office in partnership with DOJ headquarters in Washington D.C., had zero interest in tracking more than 2500 weapons they purposely gave to Mexican-narco terrorists through Operation Fast and Furious, which were used to kill hundreds of people, including U.S. federal law enforcement officers, but thought tracking law-abiding, innocent gun show attendees might be appropriate.\n\nThe ACLU's disclosure has sparked a heated debate about the balance between national security and individual privacy, and the extent to which the government should be allowed to monitor its citizens. The organization has called for transparency and accountability in the use of ALPRs and has urged the government to respect the Fourth Amendment rights of American citizens.",
    " Title: \"Immigrant Students' Academic Performance: Challenges and Success Stories\"\n\nArticle:\n\nA new study reveals that a significant number of American students hold negative perceptions towards immigrants of their own national origin, with 65 percent using negative adjectives such as \"lazy,\" \"gangsters,\" \"drug addicts,\" and \"job stealers.\" A 14-year-old boy from the Bay Area shared his perspective, stating, \"Most Americans think we are lazy, gangsters, drug addicts, that only come to take their jobs away.\"\n\nThe research also indicates that educators, often overwhelmed by the challenges of inner-city teaching, view immigrant parents as uninformed and uninvolved. The study further reveals that having just one friend who speaks English fluently is a strong predictor of positive academic outcomes. However, more than a third of the students in the study reported little or no opportunity to interact with native-born students, let alone form close friendships.\n\nThe study also found that students who arrive during their high school years, like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, face significant challenges, especially if they experience interrupted schooling, family instability, and traumatic dislocations. The younger brother, Dzhokhar, was reported to be a \"smart\" and \"respected\" student, but struggled at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth.\n\nThe research confirms declining performance over time, with nearly two-thirds of the students exhibiting such a decline. Some dropped out to find work, while others joined gangs. However, the good news is that a quarter of the students sustained high academic performance over the five-year study, and another 11 percent showed significant improvement. These students tended to be enrolled in supportive schools, have caring teachers, and develop informal mentorships with coaches, counselors, or ministers.\n\nResearchers like Alejandro Portes of Princeton and Cynthia Garcia Coll of Brown have found that the second generation - American-born kids of immigrant parents - assimilate and excel to a greater extent than the \"1.5 generation\" (children who immigrate in or before their early teens).\n\nThe study's findings suggest that assimilating immigrant students into society through academic, psychological, and other supports is crucial for their success. Models like the Internationals Network for Public Schools, where educators focus on students' distinct needs and develop authentic connections with their families, are effective strategies.\n\nThe study's findings underscore the importance of providing a supportive environment for immigrant students, as failing to do so could undermine the promise of America. The study's authors call for educators and policymakers to take note of these findings, especially as immigrants and their children will account for most of the nation's population growth in the coming decades.",
    " Title: Shellie Zimmerman Sentenced to Probation and Community Service for Perjury Charge\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a Florida court on Wednesday, Shellie Zimmerman, the wife of George Zimmerman, was sentenced to one year of probation and 100 hours of community service after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor perjury charge. The charges stem from her false testimony at her husband's bond hearing in 2012.\n\nDuring the April 22, 2012, bond hearing for George Zimmerman, who was then facing charges for the killing of Trayvon Martin, Shellie Zimmerman testified that the couple had little in the way of funds. However, State Attorney Angela Corey alleged that Shellie Zimmerman perjured herself by failing to disclose that George Zimmerman had collected over $100,000 through internet donations.\n\nAccording to court filings and recordings of jail calls released by the Florida State Attorney's Office, George Zimmerman instructed Shellie Zimmerman on how to transfer money from his bank account into hers and his sister's while he was in jail in April 2012. Shellie Zimmerman transferred over $74,000 to her personal account and nearly $50,000 to an account held by Zimmerman's sister, days before the April bond hearing.\n\nTaped phone calls between the couple revealed that they had discussed the money transfers in code to hide the funds. Prosecutors allege that Zimmerman and his wife talked about $10, $20, and $100 to mask the fact that they were referring to thousands of dollars. The calls also showed that George Zimmerman instructed his wife to \"pay off all the bills,\" including payments to American Express and Sam's Club.\n\nJudge Kenneth Lester ruled on June 3, 2012, that Shellie Zimmerman had \"testified untruthfully\" about their finances. She was later arrested on June 12, 2012, and jailed briefly in Seminole County before posting a $1,000 bond.\n\nGeorge Zimmerman, who was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the killing of Trayvon Martin on February 26, 2012, in a gated townhouse community in Sanford, Florida, was not mentioned in the court proceedings regarding Shellie Zimmerman's perjury charge.\n\nAs part of Shellie Zimmerman's one-year probation, she must abide by a list of conditions, including not possessing, carrying, or owning a firearm and getting permission to own any other type of weapon. She must also get permission from her probation officer before moving, changing jobs, or leaving the county where she lives.\n\nShe must also report regularly to a probation officer, pay $263 in court fees/fines, and pay the state of Florida $50 per month as a cost of supervision while on probation. Her probation can also be revoked if she violates the law, associates with anyone engaged in criminal activity, or uses any drugs not prescribed by a doctor.",
    " Title: Trump Extends Social Distancing Guidelines for 30 More Days Amidst Rising Coronavirus Cases\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a press conference on Sunday, President Donald Trump announced an extension of the federal guidelines urging Americans to socially distance to combat the spread of the coronavirus for another 30 days, potentially lasting until the end of April. The guidelines, which were initially set for 15 days, will now ask Americans to avoid restaurants, bars, and gatherings of more than 10 people, as well as restrict travel to essential trips only.\n\n\"During this period, it's very important that everyone follows the guidelines,\" Trump said at the Rose Garden news conference. \"The better you do, the faster this whole nightmare will end.\"\n\nThe president had initially announced 15-day guidelines, which were set to expire on Monday, and had suggested the recommendations could be relaxed. However, on Sunday, Trump said the guidelines will continue to ask Americans to socially distance until April 30. The plans to prolong the social distancing guidelines will be formalized on Tuesday.\n\nTrump noted that models of the virus' spread indicate that the worst days of the pandemic could hit the country in two weeks. The president had previously stated he would like to see the country \"reopen\" for business on Easter, a notion that deeply unsettled infectious disease experts, who said such a move could exacerbate the crisis.\n\nAsked if his optimistic assessment was a mistake, Trump said no. \"It was just an aspiration,\" Trump said on Sunday. \"That could be the peak number of deaths before it starts coming down.\" The president was referring to coronavirus cases around Easter, which is April 12.\n\nTrump said he arrived at the decision following conversations with Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, two doctors and public health experts on the White House's coronavirus task force. Fauci and Birx pointed to leading coronavirus models, which they said show that, even with social distancing and other mitigation measures in place, millions of Americans are anticipated to become infected and up to 200,000 could die. If social distancing is not followed, the estimates are even more grim, Trump noted, saying the model suggested some 2.2 million Americans could have died in the U.S. if officials ended containment efforts.\n\n\"Now we're looking at numbers that are going to be much, much, much lower than that,\" Trump said. \"And it makes everything we're doing feel much better to me.\"\n\nThe hope, Birx said, is that the model's estimates are overstating the likely case load and death toll. \"We can do better than what the predictions are,\" Birx said.\n\nTrump indicated that months more of social distancing could be in store, saying he hopes the country's rebound from the virus will start in June. \"We think by June 1, a lot of great things will be happening,\" Trump said.\n\nCoronavirus cases in the U.S. continue to soar, and virus-related deaths are mounting, with America's total fatalities doubling in just two days. More than 2,000 people affected by the virus in the United States have now died, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nExpecting the surge of coronavirus cases to continue, state and local officials are bracing for shortages of medical equipment and supplies. State leaders\u2014including Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, the nation's current virus epicenter\u2014are predicting that in the coming weeks, critical supplies like ventilators could be far outmatched by the volume of critically ill coronavirus patients.\n\nIn the news conference Sunday, Trump raised suspicions, without evidence, that medical professionals could be \"hoarding\" masks. \"Something's going on,\" said Trump, urging reporters to look into why supplies are being used so rapidly. \"Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 [used normally] to 300,000?\"\n\nThe president made the same unsubstantiated claim against hospitals, floating the unproven idea that hospitals could be hoarding ventilators.\n\nDuring Sunday's briefing, federal officials highlighted that the pace of testing has substantially sped up in recent weeks. About 894,000 tests have been conducted nationally as of Saturday, according to Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health and head of the Public Health Service, who is overseeing the administration's testing coordination.\n\nThe news conference took a hostile turn when PBS NewsHour reporter Yamiche Alcindor asked the president about remarks he made on Fox News Channel saying he did not believe states like New York need the number of ventilators state leaders are requesting.\n\n\"I did not say that,\" Trump said, denying words that were broadcast nationally to Fox News host Sean Hannity. \"Why do you act a little bit more positive? It always trying to 'get you. Get ya. Get ya.'\"\n\nThe president then attempted to make a disparaging remark to Alcindor for leaving The New York Times to join PBS.",
    " Title: New York City Truck Attack Perpetrator Identified as Islamic State Supporter, U.S. President Calls for Swift Response\n\nArticle:\n\nNEW YORK ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly truck attack that occurred this week in New York City, marking the deadliest assault on the city since September 11, 2001. The attacker, Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbek immigrant, was identified by the militant group as one of their soldiers in the latest issue of their Al-Naba newspaper.\n\nSaipov was charged in federal court on Wednesday for acting in support of Islamic State by driving a rented pickup truck down a popular riverside bike path, resulting in the deaths of eight individuals and injuring a dozen more. According to the criminal complaint against him, Saipov told investigators he was inspired by watching Islamic State propaganda videos on his cellphone, felt good about his actions, and expressed a desire to display the group's flag in his hospital room in New York.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has called for Saipov to receive the death penalty, stated on Twitter on Friday that Islamic State had claimed their soldier, the \"Degenerate Animal\" who killed and wounded \"the wonderful people on the West Side\" of Lower Manhattan. Trump further tweeted, \"Based on that, the Military has hit ISIS much harder over the last two days. They will pay a big price for every attack on us!\"\n\nIn the Middle East, the Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate appeared to be on the verge of defeat, with Syrian government forces seizing its last major city on one side of the border and Iraqi troops taking its last big town on the other. The group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is believed to be hiding in the desert near the frontier, and regional officials fear the group will reconstitute itself as a guerrilla force, capable of waging attacks without territory to defend.\n\nSaipov's sister believes he may have been brainwashed, and she appealed to President Trump on Friday to ensure he receives a fair trial. Speaking by phone from the Uzbek capital Tashkent, she expressed hope that Trump would help make sure her brother was given \"more time\" and \"a fair trial.\" In a separate interview with Radio Free Europe, she stated that she spoke with her brother the day before the attack and he was in a good mood. \"It was a usual, good conversation,\" she said.\n\nFive Argentine tourists, a Belgian woman, a New Yorker, and a New Jersey man were among the victims of Tuesday afternoon's attack. The attack unfolded just blocks from the site of the World Trade Center, where some 2,600 people were killed when suicide hijackers crashed two jetliners into the Twin Towers 16 years ago. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has located another Uzbek man, Mukhammadzoir Kadirov, 32, who they said is wanted for questioning as a person of interest in the attack.",
    " Title: Bill Gates Warns of Potential Future Epidemics, Calls for Global Preparedness\n\nIn a recent article published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Bill Gates, the renowned businessman and philanthropist, has issued a stark warning about the potential for future epidemics that could surpass the infectiousness of Ebola. Gates emphasized the importance of learning from the Ebola outbreak and preparing for future epidemics that may arise in the next 20 years.\n\nIn his article, Gates highlighted the historical occurrence of major epidemics during the 20th century, such as the Spanish influenza epidemic of 1918-1919 and the ongoing human immunodeficiency virus pandemic. He stated that an epidemic stemming from either natural causes or bioterrorism poses the most significant threat to kill more than 10 million people worldwide.\n\nGates suggested that the world should approach future epidemics like war, requiring a comprehensive plan, including an organization to manage and coordinate responses. He pointed out that despite efforts by the United States and a few other countries, there are still significant gaps in the world's ability to respond to an epidemic. Gates called for a rigorous study of the cost of building a global warning and response system and a plan for contributions from various countries.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with Gates' assessment that the primary issue lies with international response. Emmanuel d'Harcourt, the senior health director of the International Rescue Committee, told NPR that while a global response system might be helpful, local preparedness and response are crucial. D'Harcourt stated, \"We know that in most disasters, not just epidemics, but all kinds of disasters, the people who are able to respond the earliest are local. If you have local preparedness, you do not really get a major epidemic at all.\"\n\nA year after the Ebola outbreak began, cases continue in Sierra Leone, and they are on the rise in Guinea, according to the World Health Organization. The ongoing Ebola outbreak underscores the importance of Gates' warning and the need for global cooperation in preparing for future epidemics.",
    " Title: Media Frenzy: A Closer Look at the 2016 Presidential Election and the Role of the Media\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the whirlwind of the 2016 presidential election, the media has been a central player, with its coverage often taking a highly charged and polarized tone. The New York Times, a leading newspaper, has been particularly critical of Republican candidate Donald Trump, raising questions about his tax payments and business practices.\n\nThe media's portrayal of Trump has been harsh, with columnists such as Charles Blow labeling him as a \"puerile, sophomoric sniveler\" and a \"terroristic man-toddler.\" The tone of the coverage has been such that it has diverted attention from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, whose credentials and policies have been subject to less scrutiny.\n\nThe media's anti-Trump campaign has been characterized by some as a \"horsewhipping\" intended to discredit the Republican candidate. This intense focus on Trump's personal attributes and potential weaknesses has overshadowed a deeper examination of Clinton's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nClinton, who has spent much of her life preparing for high office, has been criticized for appearing frail and lacking in ideas and convictions. Her attempts to humanize herself, such as portraying herself as a grandmother and good neighbor, have been met with skepticism.\n\nThe media's portrayal of Trump and Clinton has raised questions about the role of the media in shaping public opinion. Some argue that the media's focus on Trump's personal attributes and potential weaknesses has overshadowed a deeper examination of Clinton's strengths and weaknesses. Others argue that the media's role is to hold candidates accountable and to inform the public about their policies and qualifications.\n\nRegardless of one's political leanings, it is clear that the media plays a significant role in shaping public opinion and that its coverage of the 2016 presidential election has been highly influential. As the election approaches, it is important for voters to critically evaluate the media's coverage and to make informed decisions based on a thorough understanding of the candidates and their policies.",
    " Title: Presidential Candidates' Vice Presidential Selection Process and Potential Choices for 2020\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2012 presidential election, Mitt Romney narrowed his list of potential running mates from 80 to 20 in early April, eventually selecting Representative Paul Ryan. Donald Trump's 2016 vetting process was less structured, but Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa was among those he interviewed.\n\nHillary Clinton started with a list of 40 potential candidates in 2016, which was narrowed to nine who underwent a rigorous vetting process, an interview, and a campaign appearance. Elizabeth Warren was the only woman who advanced to the final stages of the process.\n\nFor Joe Biden, the 2020 candidate, a younger woman could help alleviate concerns about his age and address criticisms about a primary process that started with a historically diverse field and ended with two white men. Biden's campaign aims to generate enthusiasm from voters as the presidential election progresses amid the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday, his campaign sent a fund-raising appeal asking supporters to \"commit to standing with\" Biden and his future female running mate.\n\nBy announcing he will pick a woman, Biden is aiming to strike a modern-day balance in a party focused on issues of racial and gender representation. Past nominees have chosen running mates who provided geographic diversity (Lloyd Bentsen in 1988) or offered the promise of winning a key state (Paul Ryan from Wisconsin in 2012). Barack Obama, just four years into his Senate term, chose Biden in 2008 to ease concerns about his own relative lack of experience and help appeal to white working-class voters.\n\nChoosing Kamala Harris, 55, would not only provide gender balance but also add a black woman to the ticket after black voters played a significant role in reviving Biden's campaign in February. However, recent criticism from Jill Biden may impact Harris' chances, as her debate stage attack is still fresh in the public's memory.",
    " Title: Foxconn's Shift in Wisconsin: From Promised Factory to Technology Hub, Leaving Job Creation and Subsidy Questions Unanswered\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the promised Foxconn factory in suburban Milwaukee, Wisconsin, may not materialize as initially planned. Louis Woo, a high-ranking assistant to Terry Gou, Foxconn's chairman, informed Reuters that the tech giant is reconsidering its plans, with the Wisconsin facility likely to be transformed into a \"technology hub\" instead of a manufacturing facility.\n\nThe technology hub will reportedly include research facilities and the production of specialized tech products, with the jobs created likely to be \"knowledge\" positions, rather than the 13,000 blue-collar jobs initially promised. This shift in strategy was already hinted at in November when The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was planning to import workers from Taiwan and China to meet its hiring goals in Wisconsin.\n\nFoxconn is currently lagging behind its job-creation promises. While the company originally promised to create 5,200 jobs by the end of 2020, Foxconn stated earlier this month that the actual number would be about 1,000.\n\nThe problems with the Foxconn factory were not difficult to foresee. Building television screens with relatively expensive American labor was always a major question mark, and it was never clear how Foxconn planned to operate a huge manufacturing center \"in what was essentially the middle of nowhere, without the sort of dense ecosystem of suppliers and sub-suppliers required for making a major factory hum.\"\n\nFoxconn's track record of failed promises is not limited to Wisconsin. The company previously walked away from a plan to invest $5 billion and create 50,000 jobs in India, and similar deals in Vietnam and Brazil. Even in America, there was evidence that Foxconn should not be trusted to make good. A planned manufacturing facility in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was supposed to employ 500 people and come with a $30 million investment, but it never materialized.\n\nThe Foxconn giveaway, with its $3 billion subsidy, was the largest such subsidy in Wisconsin history. According to the Wisconsin's Legislative Fiscal Bureau, it would take the state until 2043 to recoup the $3 billion handout, even if all 13,000 promised jobs went to Wisconsinites, with the tab averaging more than $230,000 per job created.\n\nAnother contentious aspect of the deal is the use of eminent domain to remove residents of Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin, where the new facility is to be built. Foxconn will receive more than 1,000 acres of land for free, with the logic being that the subsequent increase in land value will pay for itself eventually in the form of higher property taxes.\n\nThe Foxconn deal's failure to live up to the promises made by the company, former Governor Scott Walker, and President Donald Trump serves as a stark warning to future politicians considering similar schemes.",
    " Title: New York City Shelters Run Out of Adoptable Pets Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nIn the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic, an unexpected shortage has arisen: pets. Shelters in the New York City area, the epicenter of the disease, are reporting a surge in applications for cats and dogs, leading to a significant decrease in available animals for adoption or fostering.\n\nMuddy Paws Rescue and Best Friends Animal Society have reported that shelters they work with are either out of or almost out of cats and dogs after a spike in applications that has increased as much as 10-fold in the past two weeks. New Yorkers, ordered to shelter in place at home, are adopting or fostering pets as a means to alleviate boredom and anxiety.\n\n\"For the moment, we definitely don't have any dogs left to match with foster volunteers,\" said Anna Lai, the marketing director at Muddy Paws. \"Which is a great problem to have.\"\n\nThe increased demand for pets is also reflected in the stock market, with shares of Chewy Inc. soaring this year, despite the overall market crash. The company's website currently lists delivery times of between seven and 10 days for most customers.\n\n\"Chewy's in-home delivery model mitigates the public health concern of consumers shopping at brick-and-mortar retailers,\" RBC Capital Markets said in a report.\n\nOther pet-related companies are also outperforming. PetMed Express Inc., an animal pharmaceutical company, is up more than 7%, while Freshpet Inc. shares are down 2.3% compared to the S&P 500 Index's 23% decline.\n\nThe trend of adopting pets seems to extend beyond New York, particularly in disease hotspots. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported a 70% increase in animals going into foster care in Los Angeles. Best Friends Animal Society also reported similar trends in shelters across the U.S.\n\n\"We're seeing people show up in droves to foster,\" said Julie Castle, the CEO of Best Friends.\n\nHowever, rescue organizations are concerned about the potential rise in surrendered pets as many Americans lose their jobs due to the economic impact of the pandemic. Shelters may soon be asked to take in more animals than they have room to house.\n\n\"We're doing whatever we can to empty all of our shelter facilities,\" said Lisa LaFontaine, the CEO of the Humane Rescue Alliance, which has adoption centers in the District of Columbia and New Jersey. \"We don't know what's going to happen when the economic wave starts hitting.\"\n\nIn Washington D.C., Tom Drescher and his wife, Becky Nolin, have recently adopted Goldie, a 10-year-old mixed breed they found at an adoption site online and brought home last Friday. The couple, inspired by Goldie's age and health issues, including cancer, are enjoying their new companion.\n\n\"It occurred to us it would be a good time to adopt a dog because we'd have the time and bandwidth to help it settle in,\" said Drescher, 35. \"It's been a blast for us so far\u2014we've been thrilled to have her.\"",
    " Title: FBI Investigation into Clinton Emails and WikiLeaks Releases Add Uncertainty to Tight Presidential Race\n\nThe race for the White House has entered a new phase of uncertainty as federal investigators begin searching through newly discovered emails belonging to Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin. The emails were found on a laptop belonging to Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, who is currently under investigation for allegedly sexting an underage girl.\n\nOfficials have obtained a warrant to search those emails, but it is unlikely the review will be completed by Election Day. The presidential race has tightened dramatically in the last several days, with the gap between Clinton and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, closing significantly. Even though the polls are close, Clinton still has an apparent advantage in the Electoral College.\n\nBoth candidates are hitting key swing states where the election will likely be decided. Addressing supporters at a rally in Kent, Ohio, on Monday, the former secretary of state sounded defiant about the email controversy. \"I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of wrongdoing with just days to go?\" Clinton said.\n\n\"First of all, for those of you who are concerned about my use of personal email, I understand. As I said, I'm not making excuses, I understand and I regret it,\" she continued. \"They should look at them. And I'm sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year. There is no case here.\"\n\nMeanwhile, campaigning in Michigan, Trump kept his focus on Clinton's latest controversy. \"Thank you, Anthony. I never liked you, Anthony, but thank you very much,\" the GOP nominee said. \"The Clinton crime spree ends on Nov. 8. It's gon'na end on Nov. 8.\"\n\nClinton could face more problems in the days ahead as WikiLeaks is reportedly set to release more hacked emails related to the presidential campaign. The organization has already caused another problem for Democratic operatives, with CNN dropping former analyst Donna Brazile after WikiLeaks revealed she had leaked a question from one of the debates in the Democratic primary to the Clinton campaign.\n\nThe last week before the election could be as unpredictable as the entire campaign has been so far this year. The outcome of the election remains uncertain, with both candidates fighting to win over undecided voters and secure key swing states.",

In his first speech following his election, Schumer emphasized the need for the party to focus on fighting for the American middle class and those struggling to join it.\n\n\"I am going to wake up every single day focused on how Senate Democrats can effectively fight for America's middle class and those struggling to join it,\" Schumer said minutes after his election.\n\nSchumer acknowledged the need for the Democratic Party to learn from its recent election losses and unite behind a stronger economic message that acknowledges the system's unfairness to many Americans and the need for improvement.\n\nThe new minority leader expanded the Democratic leadership team from seven to 10, adding former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of Vermont as outreach chairman, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin as Democratic Conference secretary, and moderate Joe Manchin of West Virginia as vice chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee.\n\nSchumer addressed the ongoing debate within the Democratic Party about its direction, stating, \"Now there's a debate going on about whether we should be the party of the diverse Obama coalition or the blue-collar American in the heartland. Some think we need to make a choice... I believe there does not have to be a division. In fact, there must not be a division. We need to be the party that speaks to and works on behalf of all Americans.\"\n\nSchumer emphasized the need for a \"bigger, bolder, sharper-edged economic message\" that focuses on helping middle-class Americans do better and deals \"directly with the unfairness in the American economic system.\"\n\nSchumer acknowledged the need for Democrats to learn from their election losses and stated, \"When you lose an election like this, you can't flinch. You can't ignore it. You need to look it right in the eye and ask why, analyze it, and learn from it. One thing we know is that we heard the American people loud and clear. They felt that the government was not working for them. They felt that the economy was rigged against them in many places and that the government was too beholden to big money and special interests.\"\n\nSchumer also expressed optimism for potential areas of common ground with President-elect Donald Trump, stating, \"A silver lining in the deep clouds of this election is that President-elect Trump and his campaign were closer to us (on the economic issue) than to the Republican leadership.\"\n\nSchumer will replace 77-year-old Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, who opted to retire rather than run for re-election to the Senate. Schumer, who turns 66 next week, offers a much different style than Reid, who grew up in tiny Searchlight, Nev. Reid was a savvy backroom deal-maker but is not as telegenic or outgoing as Schumer.\n\nSchumer will be negotiating with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who was re-elected to the top leadership spot by his GOP colleagues on Wednesday. McConnell has been majority leader since 2015 and served as minority leader in the previous four Congresses.\n\nBoth Schumer and McConnell are Senate veterans. McConnell, 74, was first elected 32 years ago and is Kentucky's longest-serving senator. Schumer was elected 18 years ago after serving in the House representing Brooklyn and Queens for 18 years.\n\nDuring his time in the House, Schumer sponsored several significant pieces of legislation, including the Omnibus Crime Bill, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Brady Bill. In the Senate, he was one of the \"gang of eight\" senators who crafted a bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 but was never taken up by the House.\n\nSchumer was born in Brooklyn in 1950 and was one of three children born to Selma, a homemaker, and Abe, who owned a small pest extermination business. After graduating from Harvard Law School, Schumer returned home to Brooklyn and won a seat in the New York State Assembly. At age 29, he won his first congressional race.\n\nSchumer still lives in Brooklyn. He and his wife, Iris Weinshall, have two grown daughters. Weinshall is the chief operating officer of the New York Public Library, former vice chancellor at the City University of New York, and former commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation.",
    " Title: Record-Breaking Voter Registration Numbers Ahead of 2018 US Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2018 midterm elections approach, states across the United States are reporting unprecedented numbers of voters registering, signaling a potential surge in political engagement. The uptick in political activity comes as President Donald Trump's administration has sparked deep-rooted polarization, energizing voters on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nAccording to a report by the University of Florida's Michael McDonald, who specializes in voter turnout, 2018 appears to be an election with higher than typical midterm turnout. McDonald noted that both parties are seeing higher levels of engagement, and midterms are typically a referendum on the president and his party.\n\nIn a Pew Research Center survey, 60% of Americans said their vote would be an expression of opposition to or support of the president. Far more respondents, by a 14-point margin, said they viewed their midterm vote as being \"against\" Trump.\n\nDemocrats need to flip 24 Republican seats to take back the majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 2010. The Senate map is more favorable to Republicans, who are hoping to expand on a narrow 51-49 seat majority by toppling several red-state Democratic incumbents.\n\nSeveral states have reported record numbers of voters registering to cast their ballots in November. This month, California's secretary of state reported 19 million residents had registered to vote, an increase of about 1.5 million compared with the 2014 midterms. A similar trend was observed in Texas, where state officials cited an 11% rise in registered voters from the previous midterms.\n\nCalifornia is home to a handful of key battleground races for the House, while Democrat Beto O'Rourke's quest to unseat Republican Ted Cruz in Texas is among the most closely watched Senate races.\n\nLast month, a record number of people also registered to vote on the national voter registration day. According to the organization Nonprofit Vote, more than 800,000 people registered on the holiday, which was created in 2012. In 2014, just 154,500 people registered to vote.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how many of those who registered will show up at the polls. McDonald said there was not yet enough data from which to draw any sweeping conclusions, and that there had been little evidence to suggest the kind of turnout in midterms that the country typically sees when the White House is in play.\n\nPoliticians, celebrities, and other public figures have nonetheless escalated their calls on voters to register as deadlines come to a close in states that could prove influential in November, underscoring the importance of the moment. Trump, who has ramped up his campaign appearances on behalf of Republican candidates, implored his supporters on Tuesday to register to vote in an all-caps tweet.\n\nCelebrities have joined the chorus. Rihanna shared voter registration information across her social media platforms to tens of millions of followers. Her appeal came two days after Taylor Swift broke her silence on politics to endorse two Democratic candidates in Tennessee. Swift's rare political statement led to a spike in voter registrations that, according to Vote.org, topped 65,000 in just 24 hours.\n\nRaven Brooks, the COO of Vote.org, said celebrities were particularly persuasive in motivating young voters to the polls. \"We've been seeing an incredible spike in voter registration just in terms of numbers,\" he said, adding, \"It's definitely being driven by younger voters.\"\n\nBrooks said the vast majority of the registrations his group had seen were by voters aged 18 to 24, followed by those aged 25 to 29. \"That is completely inverted from what we saw at the same time in 2016,\" he said, noting in the previous election year the registration numbers were dominated by voters aged 30 to 39 and older.\n\n\"You're getting a lot of people into the process that are new voters, they're young voters,\" he said. \"That changes, over time, what our political leaders look like.\"",
    " Title: Missouri Republican Primary Candidates Maintain Civil Tone in Debate, Focus on Health Care and Federal Spending\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a marked departure from the recent hostility, the Republican primary debate for Missouri's open Senate seat, currently held by Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, took a more civil tone on Monday night at Lindenwood University in St. Charles. The candidates, Rep. Todd Akin, businessman John Brunner, and former state Treasurer Sarah Steelman, engaged in a 90-minute debate, focusing on health care, federal spending, and foreign policy.\n\nHealth care was a dominant topic, with all candidates expressing their desire to repeal President Obama's health care law in its entirety, including provisions that some Republicans support, such as requiring insurers to cover young adults on their parents' plans.\n\nCandidates offered varying solutions to the health care system. Mr. Brunner supports the Medicare plan proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan (Wisconsin Republican) and Sen. Ron Wyden (Oregon Democrat). Mrs. Steelman advocated for allowing insurers to sell across state lines and making health savings accounts more accessible. Mr. Akin proposed dismantling the employer-based insurance system to allow Americans to keep their coverage regardless of job changes.\n\nThe debate saw a brief moment of tension when candidates were asked about federal agencies they would eliminate. Both Mr. Akin and Mrs. Steelman named the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency, prompting a light jab from Mrs. Steelman towards Mr. Akin, stating, \"I wish he would have already cut that out of the budget since he\u2019s serving in Washington.\"\n\nDifferences emerged when candidates were asked about handling the unrest in Syria. Mrs. Steelman and Mr. Brunner emphasized caution but were open to committing troops, while Mr. Akin advocated for staying out of the \"no-win situation.\"\n\nOn Social Security, all candidates agreed that the system should be preserved for current seniors but allow younger generations to set up private savings accounts.\n\nFollowing the debate, Mrs. McCaskill's campaign released an email accusing all three candidates of favoring Wall Street investors over seniors.\n\nAccording to the latest polls, Mr. Brunner and Mr. Akin trail behind Mrs. Steelman, but all candidates beat Mrs. McCaskill in hypothetical matchups. Despite the past few weeks of exchanges between Mr. Brunner and Mrs. Steelman, neither candidate engaged in direct attacks during the debate.",
    " Title: White House Evaluating Fate of Iran Nuclear Deal as Trump Administration Weighs Options\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration is currently assessing the future of the nuclear deal with Iran, as Vice President Mike Pence stated on Sunday that no decisions have been made regarding the Obama-era agreement. The deal, aimed at halting Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions, has been a contentious issue since President Trump's election campaign, during which he vowed to dismantle the agreement if elected.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Pence criticized the deal, stating that it allows Iran to potentially develop a nuclear weapon in the future and that the country received hundreds of millions of dollars in cash in exchange. When asked about the deal's future, Pence said, \"We're evaluating that as we speak.\"\n\nLast week, the U.S. imposed renewed sanctions on Iran following the country's ballistic missile tests, which were deemed a violation of the international community's expectations. The tests have been widely condemned, with top Democrats, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (California), and the White House expressing their disapproval.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan seemed to suggest that undoing the deal entirely might be impractical, particularly in terms of reimposing multilateral economic sanctions that were lifted as part of the agreement. Ryan stated, \"A lot of that toothpaste is already out of the tube. I never supported the deal in the first place. I thought it was a huge mistake. But the multilateral sanctions are done.\" He added, \"I don't think you're going to go back and reconstitute the multilateral sanctions that were in place.\"\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the nuclear deal and the potential reimposition of sanctions comes as the Trump administration has taken a hardline stance against Iran, labeling the country a leading state sponsor of terrorism. The administration's approach to Iran remains a topic of debate, with critics arguing that the tougher stance could lead to increased tensions and potential conflict in the Middle East.",
    " Title: U.S. Debate over Boko Haram Designation and Response Strategy in 2012, and the Evolution of the Terrorist Group\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the summer of 2012, a heated debate unfolded behind the scenes at the U.S. State Department regarding the definition of the Boko Haram threat and the appropriate response to the escalating violence in Nigeria, Africa's top oil-producing nation. According to several analysts and officials who spoke anonymously with The Times, there was resistance to adding Boko Haram to Washington's official terrorist organizations lists due to concerns that such a designation would boost the group's global standing and enhance its ability to recruit new members.\n\nDespite the designation of three Boko Haram leaders as \"global terrorists\" with \"close links\" to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in June 2012, the Obama administration resisted labeling the entire group as a global terrorist organization. Instead, the administration seemed to be supporting a strategy, pushed during 2012 by Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, to create an amnesty program that would offer Boko Haram members the opportunity to avoid prosecution in exchange for laying down their weapons.\n\nThis approach, which had reportedly succeeded in taming militant activity in Nigeria's Christian south during the late-2000s, yielded no significant results in the predominantly Muslim north. The situation was further complicated by the Nigerian security forces' alleged involvement in \"serious human rights violations,\" as detailed in a Human Rights Watch report in October 2013. This report, along with the deteriorating situation in northern Nigeria, served as a backdrop for the State Department's sudden move in November 2013 to officially designate Boko Haram as a terrorist organization, ending a heated debate over the group's status.\n\nThe recent kidnapping of more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls by Boko Haram has brought renewed attention to the group and the U.S.'s role in addressing the situation. The dispatching of U.S. and British officials to aid Nigerian authorities in attempting to rescue the girls raises questions about the potential deepening of U.S. involvement in the region. The future course of action remains uncertain, but the history of the U.S.'s response to Boko Haram, as detailed in this article, provides a context for understanding the complexities and challenges involved in addressing this ongoing threat.",
    " Title: House Speaker Pelosi Suggests Rescheduling or Written State of the Union Address Amid Government Shutdown\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a letter to President Donald Trump on Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi requested that the State of the Union address be rescheduled or delivered in writing if the government remains shuttered, citing security concerns and the ongoing partial government shutdown.\n\nIn her letter, Pelosi suggested that the State of the Union address could be delivered on January 29th, if the government re-opens before then. The shutdown, now in its 26th day, is the longest in U.S. history. Trump has demanded $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and has vowed to veto any legislation that does not include the sum. Democrats oppose a wall and refuse to appropriate the money.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pelosi cited Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's designation of State of the Union addresses as a \"National Special Security Event,\" which requires a high level of security. The Secret Service, responsible for such events, is a part of the Department of Homeland Security, which is affected by the shutdown.\n\nPelosi argued that the State of the Union requires hundreds of people to work out logistics and security, and most of them have been furloughed or are working without pay because of the shutdown. Trump \"can make ( the speech ) from the Oval Office if he wants,\" she said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Trump \"has a right\" to give the speech and that Americans \"have the right\" to hear it. \"I think Speaker Pelosi is playing politics like I\u2019ve never seen a speaker before,\" McCarthy said. \"I think it\u2019s unbecoming of the office to disinvite the president.\"\n\nWritten State of the Union-type addresses were once presidential practice. The nation's first two presidents, George Washington and John Adams, delivered annual messages to Congress in person. Successor Thomas Jefferson began submitting his in writing in 1801, a routine that continued for more than a century. President Woodrow Wilson revived the practice of in-person speeches in 1913.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution states that presidents \"shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union,\" remarks formally known as the \"Annual Message\" for decades. President Franklin Roosevelt began describing the speeches as the \"state of the Union,\" a term officially adopted in 1947 during Harry Truman's administration. The last president to submit only a written State of the Union was lame duck Jimmy Carter in January 1981, four days before he left office.\n\nTrump met Wednesday at the White House with the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of House members, to discuss the shutdown. The day before, a moderate group of House Democrats spurned Trump's invitation to a White House luncheon, viewing it as an attempt to bypass Pelosi as Trump tries to win support for funding for the border wall.\n\nSeven Democrats were among the Problem Solvers who met with Trump on Wednesday: Reps. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, Thomas Suozzi of New York, Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, Anthony Brindisi of New York, Dean Phillips of Minnesota, Max Rose of New York, and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia.\n\n\"Over the last weeks, we have been listening to our constituents and speaking with our fellow members of Congress \u2013 in both parties and in both chambers,\" the Democrats said in a statement. \"There is strong agreement across the aisle and around the country: We must reopen the government. Our security, safety, and economy have been compromised, and millions of families are suffering.\"\n\nThe group said there is strong agreement that \"if we reopen the government, the possibility exists to work together and find common ground to tackle some of our country\u2019s toughest problems and fix them. But that conversation can only begin in earnest once the government is reopened.\" They accepted the White House's invitation to meet \"to convey that message.\" The names of Republican House members who attended the meeting have not been released.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump and his team had \"a constructive meeting\" with the bipartisan group. \"They listened to one another, and now both have a good understanding of what the other wants,\" she said. \"We look forward to more conversations like this.\"",
    " Title: Trump Selects Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary, Nikki Haley as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of Cabinet appointments on Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump chose Betsy DeVos, a charter school advocate and GOP donor from Michigan, as education secretary. DeVos becomes the second woman chosen to fill a spot in Trump's Cabinet, following South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley's appointment as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations earlier in the day. Both appointments require Senate confirmation.\n\nWhile Haley's selection faced limited criticism due to her limited experience on the international stage, the DeVos choice faced criticism even before it was formally announced. Conservatives warned that DeVos, a longtime Republican donor, previously supported the Common Core education standards that Trump railed against during the campaign.\n\nTrump, who was at his Palm Beach estate for the Thanksgiving holiday, called DeVos \"a brilliant and passionate education advocate.\" DeVos, from Michigan, is a longtime advocate for charter schools and school vouchers. She currently leads the advocacy group, American Federation for Children, and sits on the board of the Jeb Bush-led Foundation for Excellence in Education.\n\n\"Under her leadership, we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families,\" Trump said. DeVos said in her own statement, \"The status quo in education is not acceptable.\"\n\nThe DeVos family has been active in Republican politics for decades, especially as donors to GOP candidates and the Republican Party. DeVos' husband, Dick, is an heir to the Amway fortune and a former president of the company. The couple gave $22.5 million to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington in 2010, at the time the largest private donation in the center's history.\n\nHours before the DeVos pick was announced, conservative policy leader Frank Cannon, president of American Principles Project, called her \"an establishment, pro-Common Core secretary of education.\"\n\n\"This would not qualify as 'draining the swamp,'\" Cannon said, referencing Trump's campaign trail slogan. \"And it seems to fly in the face of what Trump has stated on education policy up to this point.\"\n\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said DeVos \"has no meaningful experience in the classroom or in our schools.\"\n\n\u201cThe president-elect, in his selection of Betsy DeVos, has chosen the most ideological, anti-public education nominee put forward since President Carter created a Cabinet-level Department of Education,\" Weingarten said. \u201cIn nominating DeVos, Trump makes it loud and clear that his education policy will focus on privatizing, defunding and destroying public education in America.\"\n\nFormer presidential contender and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush called DeVos \"an outstanding pick\" for the position.\n\n\u201cShe has a long and distinguished history championing the right of all parents to choose schools that best ensure their children\u2019s success,\" he said in a statement.\n\nWhen asked about DeVos' support for the Common Core standards, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said \"the president-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core.\"\n\n\"Anybody joining the administration is signing on to the president-elect's platform and vision for moving America forward,\" Miller said.\n\nHaley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, is the only minority member chosen by Trump so far. Retired neurosurgeon and Trump loyalist, Ben Carson, an African-American, has been offered the job of secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to a person familiar with the offer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the deliberations publicly.\n\nCarson has not yet accepted the offer, but he tweeted on Wednesday that \"an announcement is forthcoming about my role in helping to make America great again.\"\n\nTrump said that Haley, his UN choice, \"has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country.\"\n\n\"She is also a proven dealmaker, and we look to be making plenty of deals,\" he said in a statement. \"She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham praised his home-state governor as a good choice and said in a statement that he looks forward to working with her on \"overdue reforms of the United Nations.\" Graham is chairman of the Senate's Foreign Operations Subcommittee on Appropriations, which is responsible for funding the UN and all American foreign assistance.\n\nHaley said she accepted the assignment partly out of \"a sense of duty.\"\n\n\"When the president believes you have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation, and to our nation's standing in the world, that is a calling that is important to heed,\" she said in a statement.\n\nNot all presidents have treated the ambassadorship to the U.N. as a Cabinet-level position, and Republicans have tended not to grant that status. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Trump is \"spending significant time\" weighing his choice for secretary of state. Among those he has interviewed is 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who repeatedly denounced Trump during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAfter secretary of state, the UN ambassador is the highest-profile diplomatic position, often serving as the voice for U.S. positions on the international stage. As part of the Cabinet, Haley would have more opportunity to shape U.S. policies, rather than simply defend the administration's positions.\n\nYet it could be an awkward role at times. Trump campaigned on the theme of \"America first\" and said he is skeptical about \"international unions that tie us up and bring America down.\" Trump has also described the United Nations as weak and incompetent.\n\nHaley would be the third consecutive female U.S. ambassador to the UN, after Susan Rice and Samantha Power, the current ambassador. Bad blood between Trump and Haley was evident through much of the campaign.\n\n\"The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!\" Trump wrote on Twitter in March. Haley denounced several of Trump's campaign comments and urged voters to \"reject the siren call of the angriest voices.\" She told The Associated Press in July, \"A lot of the things he has said are very off-putting and concerning.\"",

It is common for sitting presidents not to attend the funerals of former first ladies.\n\nThe White House stated that the president's absence was due to avoiding disruptions caused by added security and out of respect for the Bush family and friends attending the service.\n\nMelania Trump brought two White House staff members who were close to the Bush family as her guests to the funeral. The president was accompanied by former White House head maitre d' George Hainey and current White House usher Buddy Carter, according to the first lady's office.",
    " Title: Trump Narrows Supreme Court Nominee List to Four, Senate Battle Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 After weeks of speculation, President Donald Trump will announce his pick on Monday to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. In a statement to reporters on Sunday, the president revealed that the final four candidates are Brett Kavanaugh, Raymond Kethledge, Amy Coney Barrett, and Thomas Hardiman. The president is said to be leaning toward Hardiman, who was the runner-up to Neil Gorsuch during the last nomination process.\n\nSenate Republicans have expressed confidence that whoever the president chooses from this \"supreme final four\" will be a winner. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told \"Fox News Sunday\" that \"if you're a conservative Republican, the four named \u2013 particularly Thomas Hardiman \u2013 are all winners.\"\n\nHowever, the nomination process is not without controversy. Senate Democrats have raised concerns about the so-called \"Mitch McConnell rule\" of not voting on nominees during an election year. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the rule is \"totally inconsistent.\"\n\nDemocrats are also opposed to any candidate who may be committed to overturning Roe v. Wade, a landmark case that legalized abortion in the United States. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told ABC's \"This Week\" that the president has stated he will only nominate someone who is committed to automatically overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nTrump's Supreme Court advisor, Leonard Leo, has dismissed these concerns, stating that the Roe v. Wade conversation is nothing more than a scare tactic. \"We've been talking about this for 36 years, going all the way back to the nomination of Sandra O'Connor. And after that 36-year period, we only have a single individual on the court who has expressly said he would overturn Roe,\" said Leo.\n\nDemocratic leaders are targeting moderate Republicans, hoping to get them on their side of the battle. Sen. Graham noted that red-state Democrats may be the key to securing the nomination, as they could face backlash from voters in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nEither way, the choice could have major implications for vulnerable candidates come midterm elections. \u2588\u2588\u2588 News will have special \"Faith Nation\" coverage of President Trump's announcement Monday night at 9:00 pm ET on Facebook LIVE and on CBNNews.com.",
    " Title: New Poll Shows Hillary Clinton Leading Donald Trump by 8 Points Following Democratic National Convention\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention, a new NBC News|SurveyMonkey poll indicates that Hillary Clinton now leads Donald Trump by 8 points, with 50 percent of voters supporting Clinton and 42 percent supporting Trump. This marks an increase from a single-point difference in favor of Trump last week.\n\nThe poll results come after a week of controversial comments made by Trump, including remarks about the family of a fallen American soldier and suggestions that Russian hackers should seek out deleted Clinton emails. The Republican National Convention did not result in a post-convention bounce for Trump.\n\nIn a four-way general election match-up that includes Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton leads Trump by 5 points, with 43 percent of voters supporting Clinton and 38 percent supporting Trump. This represents a lead reversal from last week, when Trump was ahead of Clinton by 2 points. Support for Johnson (9 points) and Stein (4 points) remained relatively unchanged from last week.\n\nThe poll was conducted online from July 25 through July 31 among 12,742 registered voters. The results have an error estimate of plus or minus 1.2 percentage points.\n\nClinton's gains this week were not only in the horserace numbers. The number of voters who have a strongly favorable impression of Clinton is up 5 points since two weeks ago, from 15 percent to 20 percent. Clinton's favorability among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters rose from 74 percent two weeks ago to 80 percent this week. Her unfavorable rating also dropped among Democrats from 24 percent to 19 percent.\n\nPresident Obama, who spoke at the convention last week, also saw an increase in approval this week, with his job approval rating up 3 points, from 49 percent last week to 52 percent this week.\n\nOverall, most voters who watched or followed the convention did not view the Democratic Party more favorably as a result, with 27 percent viewing the party more favorably, 35 percent viewing the party less favorably, and 37 percent saying their opinion of the Democratic Party did not change. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, half said they have a more favorable opinion of the Democratic Party as a result of the convention. Among Independent voters, 42 percent said they view the Democratic Party less favorably, and 49 percent said the convention did not change their opinion.\n\nOverall, four in ten voters said they were more interested in this year's Democratic National Convention compared to previous years. Among Democrats, 58 percent said they were more interested in this year's convention than in prior years. Roughly the same number of Republicans said that about the GOP convention last week. Among Independents, 46 percent said they had about the same level of interest this year as in previous years, and 34 percent said they were less interested this year.\n\nThe strong Democratic convention and Trump's recent troubles over his tweets toward the Khan family and comments about Russia produced a significant bounce for Clinton. The question is whether the bounce is short-lived or represents a more permanent shift in the race. For full results and methodology, click here.",
    " Title: Berlin Christmas Market Attack: Manhunt for Perpetrator Continues as ISIS Claims Responsibility\n\nArticle:\n\nGermany is on high alert as the manhunt for the perpetrator of Monday's Islamic State-claimed attack on a Christmas market in Berlin continues. The attack, which left at least 12 people dead and over 50 injured, occurred when a truck plowed through a crowd at the market outside Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.\n\nPeter Frank, the country's top prosecutor, has confirmed that investigators are treating the incident as an act of terrorism. ISIS, through its media arm, claimed responsibility for the massacre and referred to the attacker as a \"soldier of the Islamic State.\"\n\nInitially, a man who was in custody, a Pakistani citizen who arrived in Germany last year, was identified as a potential suspect. However, federal prosecutors stated late Tuesday that he denied any involvement and no forensic evidence or witness testimony has been found to prove he was in the cab during the rampage.\n\nBerlin police chief Klaus Kandt stated, \"We may still have a dangerous criminal out there.\" Holger Muench, head of Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office, added that they have not yet found a pistol believed to be used to kill the truck's passenger, identified as 37-year-old Lukasz Urban.\n\nThe owner of the trucking company and Urban's cousin, Ariel Zurawski, was asked by German authorities to identify Urban from photos. Zurawski described Urban as fighting for his life, with a swollen and bloodied face, and stated that he had suffered gunshot wounds.\n\nInterior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, Germany's top security official, stated that authorities have \"no doubt\" that the attack was intentional. The truck struck a popular Christmas market packed with holiday shoppers outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial late Monday.\n\nGermany has not experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by ISIS. The Islamic State and Al Qaeda have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack crowds.\n\nThe revelations about the attacker's identity are likely to heap more pressure onto German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose decision to accept waves of migrants from Africa and the Middle East has stoked controversy and unsettled Germany and Europe. In a Tuesday press conference, Merkel expressed her shock, sadness, and shock at the attack.\n\nThe U.S. President-elect Donald Trump blamed Islamic extremists for the attack, though it was unclear what that assessment was based on. He pledged to \"eradicate\" Islamic extremists from the face of the earth and to carry out that mission with all \"freedom-loving partners.\" The U.S. has been in contact with German officials and is ready to help in the investigation and response.",
    " Title: Trump Mocks Christine Blasey Ford at Mississippi Rally, Drawing Criticism from Senators\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a highly charged political rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night, former President Donald Trump mocked Christine Blasey Ford, a key witness in the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, accusing Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager.\n\nAt the rally, Trump mimicked Ford's testimony, drawing laughter and cheers from the crowd in Southaven, Mississippi. He questioned Ford's recollection of the alleged assault, echoing her testimony where she admitted that certain details of the time and place were lost to memory.\n\nSenator Jeff Flake, a key member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called Trump's remarks \"kind of appalling.\" Flake was standing next to the Democratic senator and fellow committee member Chris Coons of Delaware when he made the statement on NBC.\n\nTrump has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least 20 women, whose allegations he has denied and dismissed. However, last week he called Ford a \"very credible witness\" and said, \"I thought her testimony was very compelling and she looks like a very fine woman to me, very fine woman.\"\n\nAt the rally, Trump's mockery of Ford took the form of a question-and-answer routine that brought cheers from the crowd. He asked, \"How did you get home?\" and answered, \"I don't remember.\" He continued with a series of questions about the location, time, and details of the alleged assault, ending with, \"To discuss something this sensitive at a political rally is just not right.\"\n\nFlake triggered an FBI investigation of Kavanaugh last Friday after being confronted by two protesters in an elevator on Capitol Hill. He had initially signaled he would vote to approve Kavanaugh outright, but after frantic negotiations with Democrats on the committee, he agreed to a week-long delay for law enforcement to investigate allegations of serious sexual misconduct against the judge.\n\nMichael Bromwich, a member of Ford's legal team, condemned Trump's remarks as \"a vicious, vile, and soulless attack.\" In a tweet, he said, \"Is it any wonder that she was terrified to come forward, and that other sexual assault survivors are as well? She is a remarkable profile in courage. He is a profile in cowardice.\"\n\nLast week's dramatic events followed an extraordinary hearing by the committee the day before, where Kavanaugh and Ford gave dueling testimony about a party in their high school years at which Ford says the then 17-year-old Kavanaugh attempted to rape her, when she was 15. In contrast to Trump's portrayal on Tuesday evening, Ford accurately placed multiple people in Kavanaugh's contemporaneous social circle, as established by his archived calendars from the era, and gave a clear account of the alleged attack.\n\nIn her testimony, Ford said, \"I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.\"\n\nKavanaugh is Trump's second pick to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. The confirmation process for Trump's first pick, Neil Gorsuch, proceeded to a vote without significant controversy. However, Kavanaugh has been waylaid by accusations of sexual assault by Ford and two other women who have spoken out publicly, and by doubts about his testimony before the Senate, which included conspiracy-mongering and dubious descriptions of his high school and college years.\n\nSpeaking under oath before the Senate committee, Kavanaugh denied any drinking problem and denied bragging about sexual conquests in a high school yearbook entry. Former classmates have since stepped forward to say that Kavanaugh was a frequent drunk. The New York Times on Tuesday published a handwritten letter by Kavanaugh instructing friends participating in an upcoming holiday rental to \"warn the neighbors that we're loud, obnoxious drunks with prolific pukers among us.\"\n\nIn testimony last Thursday, Ford described attending a house party in the Washington DC suburbs in the early 1980s at which she was pushed into a bedroom where a drunk Kavanaugh held her down, groped her, tried to strip her, and left her fearing for her life. Ford told the Senate she was \"100%\" certain that he was her attacker, while Kavanaugh said he was \"100%\" certain he was not.",
    " Title: Obama Vows Continued Executive Action, Seeks Partnerships in Year of Action\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the concluding days of a busy week, President Obama, in his weekly address on Saturday, reaffirmed his commitment to taking unilateral actions wherever possible and finding new partners outside of Washington to help him achieve his goals.\n\n\"Wherever I can take steps to expand opportunity for more families on my own, I will,\" the president said. \"I'm going to ask business leaders, education leaders, and philanthropic leaders to partner with us to advance these goals.\"\n\nAs part of his \"year of action,\" Mr. Obama has already demonstrated his intention to work with CEOs, higher education institutions, and others to accomplish his aims. On Friday, for instance, he announced a new agreement with over 300 businesses, including some of America's top companies such as Apple, AT&T, Ford, and others, to aid the long-term unemployed.\n\nUnder the deal, companies will place less emphasis on the length of time a job applicant has been out of work and will give less weight to credit histories. The agreement is part of a larger effort to get the long-term jobless back into the workforce while an extension of unemployment benefits remains stalled in Congress.\n\nIn addition, this week, the president used executive power to raise the minimum wage for all federal contractors from $7.25 to $10.10, established new government-backed, interest-bearing retirement accounts for all American workers, and took other steps.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill countered the president's executive actions by proposing pieces of legislation that they believe both sides of the aisle should support. For example, Rep. Gregg Harper, a Mississippi Republican, pointed to a bill that would eliminate public funding for political party conventions and use those dollars to fund pediatric research at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\"We can't fix it all, but surely creating a lifetime of hope and opportunity for our most vulnerable kids is more important than subsidizing week-long political pep rallies,\" Mr. Harper said.\n\nRep. Martha Roby of Alabama highlighted a measure that would allow workers in the private sector to use their overtime toward paid time off. Such a step, Republicans argue, would address workplace flexibility and could give working fathers and mothers the chance to earn additional time off.\n\nRep. Susan Brooks of Indiana called on the president to support legislation consolidating federal training programs and strengthening federal partnerships with community colleges. The president has already tasked Vice President Joseph R. Biden to review all federal training efforts in an effort to reduce duplication and increase efficiency.\n\nRepublicans believe these bills and others can help spur new cooperation with the president this year and slow down what looks to be a wave of executive actions.\n\n\"We believe that this can be a year of bipartisan action, a moment when speeches give way to solutions,\" said Rep. Fred Upton, Michigan Republican and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \"The American people never let us down, and we can not let them down either.\"",
    " Title: The Democratic Presidential Race: A Test of Free Speech and the Pursuit of Truth\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the current race for the Democratic presidential nomination, the question of free speech and the pursuit of truth has come under scrutiny. The candidates' responses to controversial statements from their past have sparked debate, with some arguing that they are being forced to recant their views to appease the party's progressive wing.\n\nPete Buttigieg, a candidate in the race, once stated that \"all lives matter.\" This statement, which he made a few years ago when he was best known for being mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was a reflection of his belief that every life has value, regardless of race or ethnicity. However, in the modern Democratic Party, this view is no longer acceptable. As a result, Buttigieg has recently apologized for his statement.\n\nBeto O'Rourke, another candidate, was asked about a harmless joke he once told about his wife staying home to raise their children. O'Rourke's response was a complete breakdown, with him groveling, whimpering, and abasing himself. He even expanded his self-criticism and apologized for his birth, citing his \"white privilege.\"\n\nThis trend of self-flagellation and apologies for past statements has been compared to Maoist tribunals during the Cultural Revolution. By summer, one can imagine O'Rourke wearing a paper dunce cap with \"white privilege\" scrawled across it as a warning to other would-be counterrevolutionaries.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand, another candidate, has also had to face inquisitions. Years ago, when she was running for a different office, Gillibrand once expressed sympathy for the idea of a closed border. Looking back, she is deeply ashamed. She can hardly believe she ever thought something so immoral.\n\nThe Democratic candidates' responses to these inquisitions have been criticized as purely authoritarian, with some arguing that they are reminiscent of \"woke\" fascism. Power over ideas, obedience, and dissent are being punished, and lying has become the currency of public life.\n\nThe latest example of this trend is the Democratic candidates' support for Al Sharpton, who is being hailed as a legitimate civil rights leader. The candidates' support for Sharpton, despite his controversial past, has been met with criticism, with some questioning their judgment and values.\n\nThe question is not whether reparations will be implemented, but whether one wants to live in a country where such people have political power, where humor and dissent are criminal acts, where lying is the currency of public life, and where authorities can destroy individuals for thinking the wrong things. The debate surrounding the Democratic candidates' responses to their past statements raises important questions about the state of free speech and the pursuit of truth in American politics.",
    " Title: \"Paul Ryan's Voting Decisions: A Study in Pragmatism and Political Strategy\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent turn of events, Representative Paul Ryan, a key figure in the Republican Party, has found himself at the center of two significant votes that have raised questions about his political stance and potential future ambitions. On Tuesday, Ryan voted against most of his GOP colleagues, aligning with President Obama to raise taxes on wealthy Americans and increase the national debt by an estimated $4 trillion. In a separate instance, he opposed a bill that would allow the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to take on $9.7 billion in new debt to aid those affected by superstorm Sandy.\n\nRyan's actions in these two instances serve as a case study for a man who has built a reputation as an intellectual leader and someone who may have his eyes on higher office in four years. The Sandy vote was less surprising, as he had previously spoken out against some of the extraneous items in the legislation, and on Friday, he stated, \"It would be irresponsible to raise an insolvent program's debt ceiling without making the necessary reforms.\"\n\nIn a statement, Ryan expressed his support for aiding those affected by Hurricane Sandy, stating, \"We should help those affected by Hurricane Sandy as quickly as possible.\" However, he criticized the legislative response, arguing that it failed to distinguish or prioritize disaster relief over pork-barrel spending.\n\nAfter his vote to prevent the nation from going over the fiscal cliff, Ryan foreshadowed the next fight, the one over the debt ceiling, a battle he is expected to take an active role in. \"We'll never get our debt under control unless we tackle its main drivers: too little economic growth and too much spending,\" Ryan said in a statement after the bill's passage. He added that now is the time to \"return our attention to the real problem: out-of-control spending.\"\n\nThe question remains, what went into Ryan's thinking behind his two different answers to two different bills? Ryan is particularly close to House Speaker John Boehner, with whom he worked during Boehner's first congressional campaign in Ohio. However, Ryan spokesperson Kevin Seifert described his votes as \"pragmatic Paul voting his conscience.\"\n\nThe fiscal cliff vote could become an issue, particularly if Ryan decides to run for president in 2016, especially if his opponent is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who could highlight the fact that Ryan voted for the measure while Rubio voted against it. The Sandy vote could also be resurrected if his rival is New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who criticized members of his own party this week after House Speaker John Boehner decided not to vote on a $60 billion Sandy relief package.\n\nRepublican strategist Ron Bonjean suggested that Ryan's votes could be politically manageable for him. \"Looking through the 2016 primary lens, I think he can easily explain voting yes to avert the fiscal cliff, meant to protect 98 percent of taxpayers, and the issue of Hurricane Sandy, designed to save taxpayers money,\" said Bonjean. \"Put (the bill) through the regular House committee process where spending requests could be scrutinized, then there would not be any possibility of waste, fraud, and abuse. That's probably where he's looking.\"\n\nBonjean notes that the Sandy relief bill overwhelmingly passed, although 67 members, all Republicans, opposed it. \"He's consistently voted with the leadership with big issues,\" Bonjean said. \"We have not yet gone through the debate of spending cuts or the debt ceiling where spending cuts will be the debate...In a 2016 primary, he can say, 'Yes, I voted to protect 98 percent of taxpayers from having their taxes raised, but guess what. I also worked hard to make sure that we had more than enough spending cuts as the permission slip to raise the debt ceiling.'\"\n\nBonjean added, \"He's taking a look at the long game.\" Ryan notably had a low profile during the fiscal cliff negotiations, letting Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor be the faces of the fight. He was working behind the scenes, as an aide to Ryan said last month, as a \"resource to the speaker, a resource to House Republicans.\"\n\nWill Ryan be more vocal on the looming battle to raise the debt ceiling? It will be one to watch.",
    " Title: Fox News Remains Silent on Twitter Amidst Boycott, Focuses on New Subscription Streaming Service Fox Nation\n\nAhead of the launch of Fox Nation, Fox News' new subscription streaming service, the network has not tweeted since November 8, marking the beginning of a silent protest against Twitter. The boycott, which also includes the Fox Business Network Twitter feed, as well as a few other official Fox News feeds, has entered its third week, with the network remaining largely silent on the reasons behind the boycott or its intended outcomes.\n\nThe absence of tweets from Fox News, which boasts a Twitter following of 18.3 million, has raised questions about the network's reliance on the platform. According to analytics tracker SimilarWeb, only 1.4 percent of FoxNews.com's traffic in October came from Twitter, while nearly 70 percent came from direct clicks on the site.\n\nRaju Narisetti, a Columbia Journalism School professor and former senior vice president at News Corp, the parent company of Fox News, noted that Twitter is not a significant revenue source for the network. \"Twitter is not really consequential to the actual business of [Fox] or News Corp in any meaningful way,\" Narisetti said via email. \"It is a good megaphone and helpful for breaking news discovery and some brand building but not sure any major media company thinks of its use/non-use as a major revenue issue per se.\"\n\nThe boycott stems from frustration over Twitter's response to the harassment of Tucker Carlson, a prominent Fox News host, according to a Mediaite report that Fox News has not disputed. A Washington anti-fascist group had posted Carlson's home address on the platform, leading to a group of people assembling outside his home and shouting threats. After news reports, Twitter removed the offending tweets and suspended the group's account.\n\nWhile some hosts, including Carlson, have stopped tweeting, others, including prime-time colleagues Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity, have continued. The boycott has also led to a high-level Fox News editor asking digital staff not to tweet Fox News links from their personal or digital accounts \"until further notice.\"\n\nRupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox News and News Corp, has long expressed frustration with social media platforms like Twitter, which he believes benefit greatly from news publishers' content without offering enough in return. In January, Murdoch declared in a statement that Facebook and Google ought to pay publishers for the right to use their links.\n\nThe analytics support the view that Fox News can afford to boycott Twitter. Comscore found similar results to SimilarWeb, with nearly 3 percent of FoxNews.com visitors coming from Twitter (though Comscore's analysis is based on anyone who was on Twitter, and then went next to Fox News\u2014it does not mean someone directly clicked a link).\n\nDespite the boycott, Fox News has focused on promoting its new streaming service, Fox Nation, with little mention of the social media platform. The network's silence and the ongoing boycott have left many confused and speculating about the future of its relationship with Twitter.",
    " Title: Media Matters President's Past Offensive Remarks Under Scrutiny: A Case of Double Standards in Political Discourse\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of political discourse, one constant remains: the presence of scandals, often followed by their counterparts on the opposite side of the aisle. The latest instance of this phenomenon has come to light, involving the president of Media Matters, a progressive media watchdog organization.\n\nDaily Caller News Foundation reporter Peter Hasson uncovered a checkered online past for David Carusone, the president of Media Matters. Carusone's blog, now defunct, contained inflammatory statements directed at various groups, including \"trannies,\" \"jewry,\" and Bangladeshis.\n\nOne particularly offensive post, titled \"Tranny Paradise,\" detailed a 2005 incident where a Bangladeshi man was robbed by a group of transgender individuals. Carusone expressed outrage at the use of the word \"attractive\" in a news article about the incident, stating, \"The f*cking guy was Bangladeshi!\" He also criticized the police for not advising the public to avoid \"tranny bars.\"\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list of Carusone's controversial posts, as Hasson's report delves into other instances of insensitive and derogatory language used towards \"Japs\" and Jews.\n\nThe revelation of Carusone's past comments has sparked a debate on social media, with some expressing outrage and others questioning the hypocrisy in the treatment of offensive comments made by public figures. The controversy echoes the recent backlash against Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has also faced criticism for his past offensive remarks.\n\nThe double standards in the response to such scandals have been a point of contention, with many arguing that revelations of past offensive comments are used as weapons of vengeance rather than causes of true anguish. The response to Carusone's remarks is expected to be a test of this double standard, with some predicting that the comments will be largely ignored or met with minimal backlash.\n\nThe case of Carusone serves as a reminder of the importance of a consistent free-speech stance. Such a stance preserves a culture of free expression, a cornerstone of the world's greatest republic, and shields individuals from the \"gotcha\" game that often has little to do with meaningful debate and is instead focused on vengeance and punishment. As the saying goes, those who live in glass houses should not throw stones. The hypocrisy in political discourse remains a persistent challenge.",
    " Title: Trump's 2020 Budget Proposal Prioritizes Defense and Immigration, Cuts on Social Services\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that aligns with his political stance, President Donald Trump is unveiling his second budget proposal on Monday, a budget that reflects his priorities in terms of spending. This budget, often serving as a reflection of a politician's values, is no exception to the Trump administration's approach.\n\nThe budget, according to a White House preview released on Sunday, aims to reduce the deficit by $3 trillion over a decade through an \"aggressive set of spending reforms.\" White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney stated, \"Just like every American family, the Budget makes hard choices: fund what we must, cut where we can, and reduce what we borrow.\"\n\nHowever, the language of \"hard choices\" seems to be somewhat misleading. If the Republicans had not already opted for a significant tax break for corporations and wealthy individuals, the budget choices might have been less stringent. Instead, the budget appears to prioritize cuts to programs that matter to middle- and working-class families.\n\nThe budget proposes a substantial increase in funding for the Pentagon to enable a \"ready, larger, and more lethal military,\" as stated in the White House preview. Additionally, the budget includes funding for border security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain and imprison immigrants.\n\nWhile Trump is addressing the opioid crisis, his approach leans more towards law enforcement rather than treatment and recovery. However, when one looks beyond the rhetoric against immigrants and in favor of hundreds of millions of dollars for unmanned tankers and against Medicaid and food stamps, it becomes clear that the discourse of \"hard choices\" is contingent on the Republicans' previous choice to grant a massive, deficit-increasing tax cut to corporations and wealthy individuals.",
    " Title: Durbin Apologizes to Scott for 'Token' Remark on Police Reform Bill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a turn of events on Capitol Hill, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin has issued an apology to Senator Tim Scott, the Senate's only black Republican, for his criticism of Scott's police reform bill as a \"token, half-hearted approach.\"\n\nDuring a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting on June 11, 2020, Durbin, the Senate minority whip, had criticized the GOP police reform bill, introduced by Scott in response to demands for action on police brutality and racism following the police custody death of George Floyd.\n\nHowever, in a statement, Durbin's communications director, Emily Hampsten, clarified that Durbin's issue was not with Scott's bill but with the Senate Majority Leader's decision to prematurely conclude the critical debate on the issue.\n\n\"Addressing systemic racism and changing policing in America requires and deserves more than one Judiciary hearing, one floor vote, one conversation,\" Hampsten added.\n\nIn response to Durbin's remarks, Scott, a South Carolina Republican, tweeted later in the day, \"Y'all still wearing those kente cloths over there @SenatorDurbin?\" The tweet was a reference to about two dozen Senate Democrats who earlier this month donned African kente cloths and knelt in the Capitol's Emancipation Hall to express solidarity with black Americans. Durbin did not participate in that display.\n\nScott also expressed his disappointment in an emotional floor speech, stating, \"To have the senator from Illinois refer to this process, this bill, this opportunity to restore hope and confidence and trust from the American people, from African Americans, from communities of color, to call this a token process hurts my soul for my country, for our people.\"\n\nThe incident occurred on the five-year anniversary of the shooting at Emanuel AME Church by a white male who expressed racist views against African-Americans.",
    " Title: Sen. Cory Booker Releases Additional 'Confidential' Kavanaugh Emails Amid Ongoing Senate Hearing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked a heated debate, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) on Thursday night released new batches of \"confidential\" documents from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's work for former President George W. Bush. The documents, marked \"committee confidential,\" are a combined 26 pages and have not been cleared for public release or discussion.\n\nBooker released two additional tranches of emails from Kavanaugh's time as a White House lawyer. A spokesman for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) confirmed that the documents' \"committee confidential\" classification remains in effect. The releases bring the total tranches of \"confidential\" documents released by Booker to five.\n\nIn one four-page tranche released on Thursday night, Kavanaugh is trying to set up a meeting with Manny Miranda, a then-GOP Senate aide who hacked Democratic files. Kavanaugh has been grilled about what knowledge, if any, he had of Miranda's actions.\n\nIn a second 22-page tranche released on Thursday evening, Kavanaugh in 2003 forwards an op-ed which describes Roe v. Wade as a \"bad law,\" adding: \"Interesting piece from Stephen Carter, who is not conservative.\"\n\nThe releases come after Booker sparked a rhetorical firefight earlier in the day when he warned during a Judiciary Committee hearing that he would be releasing \"confidential\" information. Booker has defended his decision, arguing the document process set up by Republicans on the Judiciary panel is a \"sham.\"\n\n\"The American people regardless of your political perspective should be outraged that we have a process that is keeping critical documents hidden from the rest of the American public,\" Booker told reporters.\n\nHowever, his move drew criticism from Republicans who implied that he was breaking Senate rules in an effort to bolster potential 2020 White House ambitions. \"Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,\" Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said to Booker. \"I'd encourage our colleagues to avoid the temptation to either violate the Senate rules or to treat the witness unfairly.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Republican National Committee (RNC) also criticized Booker, stating: \"Senator Cory Booker boldly declared he is knowingly violating Senate rules.\" The spokesman's statement was followed by a 30-minute delay, during which Booker reportedly clarified that he did not believe he was violating any Senate rules.",
    " Title: Trump Bolsters Legal Team with Rudy Giuliani Amidst Ongoing Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump has appointed outspoken supporter Rudy Giuliani to his legal team to bolster his defense in the ongoing Russia investigation. Giuliani, a former US attorney, served as mayor of New York City before his appointment and is expected to be a formidable advocate for Trump in the media.\n\nTrump's personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, has stated that Giuliani will focus on the Russia probe as the White House works to conclude the president's involvement with the investigation. During a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday, Trump expressed a desire to move past the investigation and focus on other matters.\n\n\"We want to get the investigation over with, done with, put it behind us and we have to get back to business,\" Trump said.\n\nIn recent days, the president has appeared more relaxed about the investigation, suggesting he has put the notion of firing special counsel Robert Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of the Russia probe, on hold. Last week, Rosenstein reportedly told the president he is not a target of any part of the special counsel's investigation or the probe into Trump's longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n\n\"As far as the investigation, nobody has ever been more transparent than I have \u2013 instructed our lawyers be totally transparent. I believe we've given them 1.4 million pages of documents if you can believe that,\" the president said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Justice, in response to subpoena threats from Republican lawmakers, has provided Congress with copies of several of James Comey's infamous memos written while he was director of the FBI. The memos detail Comey's accounts of his meetings with President Trump before he was fired.\n\n\"Given the nature of the person, as I understood the president-elect, he might not tell the truth about those if it ever became an issue so I needed a written record,\" Comey said during an appearance on MSNBC Thursday.\n\nHowever, in a joint statement, chairmen of three congressional committees say the memos show Comey never wrote he felt obstructed or threatened. \"Former Director Comey's memos show the president made clear he wanted allegations of collusion, coordination and conspiracy between his campaign and Russia fully investigated,\" Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Trey Gowdy (R-SC), and Devin Nunes (R-CA) wrote.\n\nThe president took to Twitter to express his satisfaction with the memos, stating they prove there was no collusion and no obstruction. \"James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?\" Trump tweeted on April 20, 2018.\n\nIt's the latest development in an investigation the White House will be eager to see come to a close.",
    " Title: Increased ICE Enforcement Activities Across U.S. Spark Concern Among Immigrant Rights Groups\n\nArticle:\n\nOver the past five days, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have conducted what they call an \"enforcement surge\" in various cities across the United States, resulting in the arrest of over 160 undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles area alone. This surge in enforcement activities has also been reported in cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Charlotte, and Austin, according to immigrants' rights groups and lawyers.\n\nICE officials and the White House claim this is a routine operation, while activists, lawyers, and members of Congress argue it represents a significant change in enforcement tactics. Sarah Owings, an immigration attorney in Atlanta, stated, \"They're out and they're hunting.\" Owings reports that up to 40 undocumented immigrants have been detained in the Savannah, Georgia, area over the last two days, and she knows of two apartment complexes with high concentrations of Latino residents where ICE officers went door-to-door looking for specific individuals.\n\nIn a statement, an ICE spokesperson criticized recent media coverage of the Los Angeles apprehensions, stating, \"The rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous, and irresponsible.\" On Feb. 9, an ICE official told reporters on background that reports the agency arrested 100 people in the Los Angeles area that day were \"grossly exaggerated.\"\n\nMany immigration activists and Capitol Hill Democrats question the agency's statements. Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, stated, \"There's not much confidence in the agency's statements.\" Bob Libal, the executive director of Grassroots Leadership\u2014a group based in Austin that opposes immigrant detention and deportation\u2014suspects the agency may have targeted Austin due to frustration over the county sheriff's recently announced refusal to comply with ICE's detainer requests.\n\nImmigration activists point to President Donald Trump's Jan. 25 executive order, \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\" as the impetus behind the enforcement surge. Azadeh Erfani of the Capital Area Immigrants' Rights Coalition wrote in a blog post that the executive order made upwards of 8 million undocumented immigrants top priorities for deportation.\n\nTrump has not kept all his immigration-crackdown campaign promises; despite making it a key campaign issue, the president has yet to undo the temporary deportation protections that President Barack Obama made available to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nA staffer for a Democratic congressional office that frequently criticized the Obama administration's immigration enforcement practices stated that the week's enforcement uptick was uniquely concerning. He said that though the ICE conducted raids that resulted in dozens of arrests during Obama's presidency, this particular surge worries activists because it's happening in so many cities around the country at the same time and in the wake of Trump's executive order. Some Hill Democrats worry this could be the new normal, he added.\n\n\"It will happen until the beds are full,\" she said. \"They'll have to stop at some point, right?\"",
    " Title: Brazilian President Bolsonaro Blames NGOs for Amazon Fires, Amidst Increase in Deforestation and Fires in the Amazon Rainforest\n\nArticle:\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has stated that his government lacks the resources to combat the thousands of fires currently ravaging the Amazon rainforest. In a press conference on Thursday, the president suggested that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) may have started the fires as a form of retaliation for his government's funding cuts to these organizations. However, he admitted that he had no evidence to support this claim.\n\nEarlier this week, Brazil's Environment Minister Ricardo Salles faced heckling at a meeting on climate change. The president's comments come amidst growing concerns over the rapid deforestation of the Amazon, with satellite data published by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) showing an 85% increase in fires across Brazil this year, most of which are in the Amazon region.\n\nThe Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, plays a crucial role in slowing down global warming as it is a vital carbon store. On Thursday, when questioned about the responsibility for the fires, President Bolsonaro responded, \"The Indians, do you want me to blame the Indians? Do you want me to blame the Martians?... Everyone is a suspect, but the biggest suspects are NGOs.\" When asked if there was any proof of this, he replied, \"Did I accuse NGOs directly? I just said I suspect them.\"\n\nPresident Bolsonaro's comments have further angered those concerned about the spike in fires, as he has previously cast doubt on figures suggesting that the Amazon is deteriorating rapidly. Last month, he accused Inpe's director of lying about the scale of deforestation and trying to undermine the government. The director of the agency later announced that he was being sacked amidst the row.\n\nAt the Latin American and Caribbean Climate Week in the Brazilian city of Salvador, some attendees heckled and booed President Bolsonaro when his name was announced. The conference, organized by the United Nations, aims to promote action on climate change in the region.\n\nClimate activists and conservationists have been critical of the Bolsonaro government and its policies, which prioritize development over conservation. They argue that since President Bolsonaro took office, the Amazon rainforest has suffered losses at an accelerated rate. The figures and satellite images showing most of the state of Roraima, in northern Brazil, covered by smoke have shocked many Brazilians and triggered a global Twitter trend under the hashtag #prayforamazonia.\n\nHowever, some of the most striking images shared on social media are not all they seem. The hashtag #PrayForAmazonia started to be widely used on Tuesday and has been included in almost three million tweets since. The most widely shared tweet using that hashtag - with more than a million likes and retweets - includes two aerial images of forest fires, neither of which show the current situation. One dates as far back as 1989, and other widely shared images include fires as far away as Siberia or the United States.\n\nWildfires often occur during the dry season in Brazil, but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching. \"The dry season creates the favorable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident,\" Inpe researcher Alberto Setzer told Reuters news agency.\n\nRicardo Mello, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Amazon Programme, said the fires were \"a consequence of the increase in deforestation seen in recent figures.\" This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year. After more satellite data was made accessible, it has been updated to reflect the fact the fires are instead the worst since 2010.",
    " Title: Trump Poised to Shape Supreme Court with Second Appointment, Bolstering Conservative Influence\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - With the announcement of Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement, President Donald Trump is set to further solidify conservative influence on the Supreme Court, potentially reshaping key social issues such as abortion rights.\n\nFollowing Kennedy's retirement announcement on Wednesday, White House officials stated that Trump's selection of a new justice could shape U.S. justice for decades to come. A senior White House official commented, \"This is a legacy for the president. It will further his agenda of remaking the courts.\"\n\nAt a rally in North Dakota on Wednesday night, Trump emphasized the importance of choosing a justice who would serve for an extended period, stating, \"We have to pick a great one. We have to pick one that\u2019s going to be there for 40 years, 45 years.\"\n\nKennedy's replacement could play a pivotal role in potentially limiting or even overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which established a constitutional right to abortion in 1973. The prospect of altering or restricting this ruling has long been a goal of conservative activists and has contributed to conservative Christian support for Trump.\n\nAlthough Kennedy was a conservative justice appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, he was often considered the \"swing vote\" on the court due to his willingness to join liberal justices on various issues, including expanding gay rights and upholding abortion rights. By selecting a social conservative to replace Kennedy, Trump would secure a 5-4 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, even on divisive social issues.\n\nWhile Trump did not make rolling back abortion rights a central campaign issue, many conservative supporters have expressed a desire to see Roe v. Wade overturned. Trump has pledged to appoint anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, choosing an ultra-conservative nominee could pose risks for Trump, as he would need to secure support from moderate Republicans in the Senate to confirm the new justice. White House officials anticipate that Trump will begin interviewing candidates from a list of 25 potential nominees, with the aim of having the new justice confirmed by the Senate in the autumn.\n\nThe timing of the appointment could help boost conservative voter enthusiasm and turnout for the November congressional elections, as Republicans strive to maintain control of both houses of Congress. The White House believes that a high-profile Supreme Court battle will serve as a reminder to voters of the stakes in the upcoming elections.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Supreme Court has handed Trump a series of victories in politically charged cases, including upholding his travel ban on people entering the United States from several majority-Muslim countries. The court's decisions, coupled with Kennedy's retirement, could embolden the administration's lawyers, who are currently facing legal challenges on multiple fronts, including over Trump's move to separate families who enter the United States illegally and his plan to rescind protections for \"Dreamers,\" young adults brought to the country illegally as children.\n\nAn open seat on the Supreme Court was a significant factor in rallying conservatives behind Trump's presidential election campaign in 2016. Trump capitalized on this issue by repeatedly informing voters that only he could prevent the court from shifting to the left should Democrat Hillary Clinton win. Trump delivered on this promise by selecting Neil Gorsuch, who has become one of the most conservative justices.\n\nIn addition to his Supreme Court appointment, Trump has also filled a record-breaking number of seats on the influential federal appeals courts and District Courts, with the Senate's enthusiastic backing. Trump appeared excited about the opportunity to further reshape the federal judiciary in a conservative direction. \"We will begin our search for a new justice of the United States Supreme Court,\" Trump said at the White House. \"And hopefully we\u2019re going to pick somebody who will be as outstanding.\"",
    " Title: Iowa Poll Shows President Trump Leading in Head-to-Head Matchups Against Warren and Biden, Sanders Ahead in Democrat Field\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent poll conducted by Emerson College, President Donald Trump is leading both Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D) in hypothetical general election matchups in the state of Iowa. The poll, taken between October 13-16, 2019, among 888 registered voters in Iowa, showed the president leading both candidates 51 percent to 49 percent.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), however, appeared to hold an advantage in a hypothetical matchup, leading the president by two points\u2013 51 percent to Trump\u2019s 49 percent. The margin of error is +/-3.2 percent, indicating that the race is in flux.\n\nThe poll results show Sanders\u2019 lead against the president despite the fact that he is not leading the Democrat field in Iowa. Sen. Warren and Biden are tied with 23 percent support each, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) who garnered 16 percent support. Sanders fell to fourth place with 13 percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D), Gov. Steve Bullock (D), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with five percent, four percent, and three percent, respectively.\n\nThe poll also showed some trouble for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who has been trying to revive her floundering campaign by focusing on Iowa. Harris signaled a switch in campaign strategies in September, telling a colleague that she is \u201c moving to Iowa.\u201d Despite those efforts, she was only able to garner two percent support in the state, alongside Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Tom Steyer (D).\n\nThe poll also showed that more Iowans oppose impeachment than support it, 48 percent to 42 percent. Impeachment does not appear to be a top priority among Iowans, with only six percent considering it an important factor in choosing whom to support for president. The economy, health care, and social issues were the top three issues for Iowans, with 33 percent, 19 percent, and 10 percent, respectively, identifying them as the most important issues.\n\nEmerson Polling Director Spencer Kimball stated, \"The Democrats have some work to do in Iowa convincing voters that impeachment is a top priority of Congress; 67 percent of Democrats in Iowa support impeaching the president, but only 10 percent identify it as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president.\"",
    " Title: President Obama Weighs In on Marijuana Legalization, Citing Personal Experience and Individual Harm\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview with The New Yorker, President Barack Obama has expressed his views on the ongoing debate regarding marijuana legalization. Citing his own past experiences with the drug, Obama stated that he does not view marijuana as more dangerous than alcohol or cigarettes.\n\n\"I don't think it is more dangerous than alcohol,\" the president told David Remnick in a lengthy profile published Sunday. Obama, who admitted to smoking marijuana as a young person, compared the drug to cigarettes, which he also smoked for a significant portion of his adult life.\n\nWhen asked whether marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol, the president, after a pause, responded that it is \"in terms of its impact on the individual consumer.\" However, he emphasized that he does not encourage the use of marijuana and has warned his daughters about the potential harm it can cause.\n\nOne issue that concerns Obama is the disproportionate incarceration rates of minorities and those in poverty due to marijuana-related offenses. \"Middle-class kids don't get locked up for smoking pot, and poor kids do,\" he said, highlighting the hypocrisy of the current system.\n\nThe president also addressed the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington state, stating, \"It's important for it to go forward.\" He argued that it is crucial for society to avoid a situation where a large number of people have broken the law, but only a select few are punished.\n\nHowever, Obama cautioned against overstating the benefits of legalization, acknowledging that the new laws in Colorado and Washington state will present challenges and could lead to tougher debates on harder drugs in the future. He raised questions about the potential for negotiated doses of other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, and whether society would be prepared to accept such substances if they were deemed less harmful.\n\nIn conclusion, President Obama's views on marijuana legalization are nuanced, reflecting a personal history with the drug and a concern for the disproportionate impact of marijuana-related laws on marginalized communities. While he supports the legalization of marijuana, he also cautions against overstating its benefits and the potential challenges that may arise in the future.",
    " Title: The Left's Absence in the Fight Against Islamism: A Historical Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a thought-provoking analysis, the author argues that the Left's approach to combating ideological evils has remained consistent over time, with a focus on lesser or fabricated evils rather than addressing the most significant threats. This pattern is evident in the Left's response to both Communism and Islamism.\n\nDuring the Cold War, while many conservatives and liberals fought against Communism, the Left opposed anti-Communism. The Left viewed the Cold War as a mere conflict between two antagonistic forces, rather than a battle between democracy and totalitarianism. They criticized Reagan's labeling of the Soviet Union as an \"evil empire,\" with prominent intellectuals like Henry Steele Commager dismissing Reagan's speech as the worst in American history.\n\nIn the current context, the Left is following a similar pattern in its response to Islamism. Instead of fighting Islamists, the Left is focusing on those who oppose Islamism, labeling them \"Islamophobes\" and \"racists.\" This approach places the Left in opposition to American conservatives and Israel, the country most directly confronting Islamism.\n\nThe author contends that this pattern is a result of the Left's desire to maintain a sense of moral superiority. They argue that the Left perceives itself as more compassionate, enlightened, and intellectual than conservatives, and believes it cares more about marginalized groups than conservatives do. However, the author suggests that this self-perception leads the Left to prioritize lesser or fabricated evils over real ones, as fighting real evil requires moral courage in addition to moral clarity.\n\nThe author provides examples of this pattern, such as the Left's relentless fight against racism in America, despite America being the least racist multiracial society in history, or their focus on fighting Nazis and white supremacists, who, though evil, pose a negligible threat. The author also mentions the Left's opposition to religious Americans, particularly Christian and Jewish conservatives, and their fight against global warming.\n\nThe author concludes by noting the Left's current focus on statues as another example of this pattern, citing their historical absence in the fight against Communism and Islamism. The author suggests that this pattern is not conducive to effective moral action, as it prioritizes symbolic battles over real ones.",
    " Title: Congress to Vote on Keystone XL Pipeline Amidst Louisiana Senate Race\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the upcoming weeks, Congress will be voting on two bills that aim to authorize the construction of the contentious Keystone XL pipeline. The bills' sponsors, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), are gearing up for a runoff election on December 6 to determine the Senate seat winner.\n\nOn the Senate floor, Landrieu advocated for action on the Canada-to-Texas pipeline project, stating, \"I believe with a push we could actually get the votes that we need to pass the Keystone pipeline.\" Shortly after, Republican leaders in the House scheduled a vote for Thursday on a Keystone bill sponsored by Landrieu's rival, Cassidy.\n\nThe pipeline, a point of contention in Louisiana, where the oil and gas industry plays a significant role, is a key issue in the state. Energy company TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline would transport tar sands oil from Canada to Texas, a project that has been a source of debate, with some arguing it would create thousands of jobs, while others claim it would increase greenhouse gases and be too expensive and toxic to refine.\n\nConcerned landowners along the pipeline's proposed path have voiced their opposition, expressing concerns about property disruption and potential damage to farms, particularly in the event of a leak. In February, a Nebraska judge invalidated a 2012 law that allowed part of the pipeline to run through the state.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that the Obama administration is not receptive to the news of a vote on the matter:\n\n\"While the White House did not issue a direct veto threat, spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama holds a 'dim view' of legislative efforts to compel action on the project. Earnest reiterated Obama's preference for evaluating the pipeline through a long-stalled State Department review.\"",
    " Title: Vanessa Trump Speaks Out on Frightening Envelope Incident, Condemns Recent Bomb Scares\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement to Axios on Friday, Vanessa Trump, the estranged wife of Donald Trump Jr., spoke out for the first time about the incident in which she was rushed to the hospital after opening an envelope containing white powder addressed to her husband.\n\n\"This is personal for me because I know firsthand what it is like to be targeted and terrorized by a coward with a vendetta,\" she said in the statement.\n\nLast February, she was hospitalized in New York City, along with two other people who were at the residence at the time she opened the envelope. According to reports, she felt sick and started coughing after opening the item. The authorities later found the substance in the letter to be cornstarch.\n\n\"I was rushed to the hospital, evaluated, and put on Cipro [an antibiotic] for the longest two weeks of my life, and while they worked to identify whether the white powder was deadly, I spent the entire time thinking about the horrifying possibility that I would never see my five beautiful children again,\" her statement reads.\n\n\"It was a cowardly act against a mother. And even today, every time I open the mail, I feel the same fear in my heart as I did that day,\" she added.\n\nTrump, who is soon to divorce from her husband with whom she shares five children, condemned the recent bomb scares against prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"These recent acts are the acts of a coward and nothing more than terrorism, pure and simple. No one, regardless of political party or ideology, should ever have to go through what I went through,\" Trump said.\n\nResponding on Twitter to his soon-to-be ex-wife's statement, Trump Jr. wrote: \"I am so proud of the mother of my children for sharing this story, which caused our family so much pain. These acts of terror are not owned by one political party. I wish all Americans would acknowledge that fact and condemn all violence. Thank you, Vanessa.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Daniel Frisiello, the man accused of sending the powder-filled letters to Trump Jr. and other prominent Democrats, pleaded guilty. One of the messages read: \"You are an awful, awful person. I am surprised that your father lets you speak on TV. You, the family idiot, Eric, looks smart.\"\n\n\"This is the reason why people hate you, so you are getting what you deserve,\" the message continued. Frisiello will be sentenced in January and has agreed not to appeal his sentence if it's 7 1/4 years or less.",
    " Title: Controversial Tweet by BJP Karnataka Triggers Outcry, Accusations of Mockery and Fear-Mongering\n\nArticle:\n\nNew Delhi, India - A tweet posted by India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has sparked controversy, with the right-wing party accused of mocking a phrase used by anti-Citizenship Law protesters. The slogan \"Kaaghaz Nahi Dikhayenge Hum\" (we will not show the documents) has been a recurring theme during the more than seven weeks of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).\n\nThe tweet, posted by the BJP Karnataka handle, reads: \"Keep the documents safe, you will need to show them again during # NPR exercise.\" The government has yet to decide on the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), but wants to go ahead with the National Population Register (NPR), which critics say is a precursor to the NRC.\n\nThe tweet has garnered over 31,000 likes and has been retweeted more than 10,000 times. Many have criticized the BJP for threatening protesters, while some BJP supporters have taken exception to the tone of the tweet.\n\nSenior journalist Suhasini Haider tweeted: \"This taunting and mocking tone towards a minority by the ruling party is not just frightening; it is against everything India stands for.\" Gazala Wahab, assistant professor at JNU's Centre for the Study of Law and Governance, said: \"There is reason to believe that the party's bigoted dog-whistling is the true intent, and the union government's denials are not taken seriously even by the party in power itself.\"\n\nThis is not the first time the BJP Karnataka handle has come under fire for controversial tweets. Last month, it posted a controversial tweet comparing a student from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) with a gunman who fired at protesters near Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) university in New Delhi.\n\nEven some BJP supporters took exception to the tone of the tweet. Amrita Bhinder, a vocal supporter of the BJP and a former member of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha [the BJP youth wing], wrote: \"Not done! Adds to the fear factor! Derails PM Modi's pitch. Please be sensible.\"\n\nDelhi-based activist Shabnam Hashmi told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Karnataka BJP is \"menacingly offensive\" and is constantly creating an atmosphere of \"hate and polarisation.\" She said, \"It seems to say whether you [Muslims] like it or not, you will have to show the documents during NPR. Not only Muslims but all marginalized sections will suffer heavily during the NRC process, the first step of which begins with NPR.\"\n\nBJP leaders from Karnataka have been accused of whipping up a xenophobic frenzy, with the state government cracking down on undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh. Last month, hundreds of people were rendered homeless after authorities demolished a slum in the state capital of Bengaluru, also known as the Silicon Valley of India, over rumors it was inhabited by Bangladeshis. It later turned out that all residents were Indian citizens.\n\nTejasvi Surya, a BJP member of parliament from Karnataka, has been accused of fear-mongering and Islamophobia. \"Shaheen Bagh is [a] symbol of Islamic fanaticism in garb of constitutional secularism,\" he tweeted, referring to the epicenter of anti-CAA protests.\n\nCritics say the citizenship law, which fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslims from three neighboring countries, goes against the country's secular constitution. The law, along with the proposed nationwide NRC, has instilled fear among the country's Muslims, who form nearly 15 percent of India's 1.3 billion population.\n\nIndia has witnessed massive protests after the BJP-led government passed the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act in December last year. Nearly 30 people have died in the anti-CAA protests across the country so far. A similar exercise conducted in the northeastern state of Assam excluded nearly two million people from the citizenship list last year. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said no individual will be required to submit any document for the NPR survey, but the tweet by Karnataka BJP says otherwise. BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli also said the NPR does not require citizenship documents. \"The tweet by the Karnataka BJP handle\u2026 leads to an unnecessary confusion because the NPR does not require any documents and it has been reiterated by the union government on a number of occasions,\" he said.",
    " Title: Lawmakers Introduce Bill to Enhance Long-Term Fiscal Transparency in Washington\n\nArticle:\n\nSenators John Thune (R-SD) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) have introduced a bill in Congress, dubbed the Intergenerational Financial Obligations Reform Act (INFORM), aimed at increasing transparency in the budget process and promoting long-term fiscal planning. The bill seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of current and future budget realities on the fiscal health of the country and individual Americans over the next 75 years.\n\nThe INFORM Act requires the president to present a detailed accounting of the administration's budget and policy recommendations, as well as predictions of economic health, in terms of their long-term effects on future generations. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) would be tasked with providing an annual analysis of the impact of future budget realities on generations to come and accounting for any fiscal gaps.\n\nThe bill is a response to concerns about Washington's short-term thinking, which has led to the passing of bills that address immediate fiscal problems while ignoring long-term consequences for future generations. The senators argue that this approach has resulted in a fiscal gap that places unknown financial burdens on today's young people.\n\n\"We may have different prescriptions for how to address our budget challenges, but from a personal standpoint, we both worry about how a lack of information about long-term budget realities will affect our children's generations and those that follow,\" the senators stated in a joint press release.\n\nThe INFORM Act employs a generational accounting and fiscal gap analysis, examining the full scope of the government's obligations, present and future, and their impact on current and future generations. Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush each used this tool in submitting executive budgets.\n\nThe bill is an effort to ensure that young Americans in their 20s and 30s are informed about the decisions of today's lawmakers and their impact on their future. The senators believe that this approach will help improve the fiscal health of the country and encourage better decision-making in Washington.\n\n\"Washington has spent enough time kicking the can down the road. It's time to start being honest about the long-term challenges facing future generations,\" the senators concluded.",
    " Title: \" The Shift to Remote Work: A Permanent Transformation for U.S. Employees and Companies Amidst the Pandemic\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has catalyzed a significant transformation in the U.S. workforce, with millions of white-collar workers transitioning from office life to working from home. As the pandemic continues, companies and employees are preparing for several more months of remote work, with some questioning whether a return to the office is imminent.\n\nBefore the pandemic, less than 4 percent of the U.S. workforce worked remotely. In a matter of weeks, this number skyrocketed to include approximately a third of all workers in the country. Companies, particularly those in the tech sector, have extended their work-from-home periods until the end of the year, with Twitter becoming the first major firm to allow employees to work permanently from home, if they choose.\n\nThe mass migration of the white-collar workforce into home offices has been so transformative that a significant portion of workers may never return, many industry experts say. The primary reason for this change may become permanent is the apparent benefits it offers to everyone involved. Employees are spared the time and expense of commuting and have more opportunities to see their families. Many report they have been more productive at home than in the office.\n\nCompanies could see major financial benefits from cutting their spending on expensive real estate and reducing the cost of maintaining office space, especially with the extra safety measures that will likely need to be implemented. Employers that had been reluctant to allow remote work have seen that many concerns about lost productivity and harm to company culture are unfounded, labor analysts say. The pandemic also forced companies to tackle the expense and logistical challenges that may have been barriers to broad work-from-home policies.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that the pandemic will lead to permanent changes. While working from home may be better for some employees, it has been an enormous strain for others. Extended periods of remote work could result in a surge in depression and loneliness, trends that may not have manifested in the short period since lockdown orders were put in place. Certain industries that rely on creativity and problem-solving may fear that work will suffer without in-person collaboration. Other firms might be reluctant to surrender the control that comes from having all employees in the same place.\n\nOne thing is certain: many employees have proved they can effectively work from home, and companies are expected to continue letting many do so for a long time. The economic impact of the pandemic will likely force many employers to cut costs. For companies to reduce their rent obligations by letting workers work from home is an easy solution, one that's less painful than layoffs.\n\nExecutives and managers have the opportunity to choose quality work over quantity of work. They can value the creative ideas that emerge after a midday hike or meditation session, rather than putting in face time at the office. They can stop rewarding the faster response over the better response, or the longer workday over a more productive workday.\n\nAs we sink into a recession, the job market will be tight for everyone. That means that while employers could offer benefits like working from home, they might not feel the need to. Sure, an employee might feel safer and happier if they don't expose themselves to germs on the subway and in the office. But with fewer job openings, a company can probably find someone else who doesn't mind coming in.\n\nThe pandemic has shown that people can do their jobs effectively from home, and companies are expected to continue this trend for the foreseeable future. The question remains, however, whether this shift will be permanent or temporary, and what the long-term implications will be for both employees and companies.",
    " Title: Trump and Kim Jong Un Agree to Historic Summit: A Cautious Approach\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump has accepted an invitation for a face-to-face meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, marking a potential historic moment in U.S.-North Korea relations. The meeting, scheduled to take place before May, could be a significant achievement, comparable to President Nixon's visit to China and the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to approach this development with caution. The path to a successful summit is still uncertain, and much work remains to be done. The two leaders have yet to agree on a specific location for the meeting, with speculation suggesting it may take place along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating North and South Korea.\n\nPresident Trump must tread carefully to ensure that Kim Jong Un's overture is sincere and not a ploy to gain an advantage in negotiations. To this end, the Trump administration should consider the following recommendations:\n\n1. Insist on the meeting taking place in South Korea, ideally at the DMZ, to avoid legitimizing North Korea's human rights abuses and continued detention of U.S. citizens.\n2. Maintain the planned U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises, as North Korea has been training its army throughout the winter.\n3. Refrain from offering economic incentives to North Korea, such as food aid or sanctions relief, to prevent the possibility of North Korea using these incentives to stall for time and continue developing its nuclear weapons and missile programs.\n4. Require North Korea to provide a preliminary roadmap for denuclearization, to ensure that the negotiations are not used as a means to buy time for further nuclear weapons development.\n\nIf North Korea fails to offer even a preliminary roadmap for denuclearization, President Trump should decline the invitation. The Trump administration owes it to history to explore this opportunity, but must remain vigilant to avoid repeating past mistakes in dealing with North Korea. This is uncharted territory, and the outcome remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Gabrielle Giffords' Super PAC Takes a Tougher Stance on Gun Control Advocacy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2011 Tucson shooting that left then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords critically injured, the United States has witnessed a series of high-profile mass shootings. These events have prompted calls for stricter gun control legislation, but efforts to enact changes have consistently faced resistance.\n\nNow, Gabrielle Giffords, who retired from Congress and became an ardent advocate for gun control, is taking a tougher approach with her super PAC, Americans for Responsible Solutions. The group's tactics this election cycle are described as \"mean\" by Politico, with ads targeting Republican candidates who oppose stricter gun control measures.\n\nOne such ad features a heart-wrenching testimonial from Vicki, a woman whose 19-year-old daughter was murdered by an enraged ex-boyfriend. The ad accuses the Republican candidate, Martha McSally, of opposing measures that would make it harder for stalkers to obtain guns.\n\nThe ad has been criticized as \"base and vile\" by the Arizona Republic's editorial board, which argues that the ad exploits a family's tragedy for political gain. However, Gabrielle Giffords' involvement in the making of the ads has been confirmed, and she is reportedly deeply involved in the group's messaging.\n\nGiffords' approach to gun control advocacy has been met with criticism for its perceived lack of civility. However, her supporters argue that the gruesome reality of gun violence should not be sugarcoated, and that the ad's message is a stark reminder of the consequences of lax gun policies.\n\nGiffords' transformation from a bipartisan lawmaker to a tougher gun control advocate has been a topic of debate. Some argue that the Tucson shooting changed her, while others believe she has always been committed to the cause. Regardless, her approach to gun control advocacy is a reflection of her determination to make a difference in the face of resistance.\n\nGiffords' legacy as a lawmaker known for her decency and good judgment should not be tarnished by the tactics of her super PAC, some argue. However, others see her approach as a necessary response to the inaction of politicians who resist even the most modest gun control measures.\n\nIn the end, Gabrielle Giffords is not obligated to be a \"Civility Unicorn.\" She is a survivor of gun violence who is fighting to prevent others from suffering the same fate. Her approach may be tough, but it is a reflection of her commitment to the cause and her anger at the senseless violence that continues to plague the United States.",
    " Title: Debt Limit Standoff: A Closer Look at the Remaining Controversies and the Role of Senate in Resolution\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the debt limit standoff enters its final stages, the contours of the deal are becoming clearer, with the Tea Party faction seemingly defeated. However, some movement conservatives are clinging to fantasies, viewing the drama as a modern-day reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nThe Associated Press reports an inverse relationship between these two perspectives. While the parties are now haggling over minor details, the proximity of a resolution is causing desperation among the die-hard conservatives, leading to delusions.\n\nThe article presents several instances of such delusional behavior, from individuals waving both a Marine Corps and a Confederate flag, to those advocating for violence, and others demanding President Obama to \"put the Quran down\" and \"come out with his hands up.\"\n\nDespite these sensational displays, the real action has shifted to the Senate, with Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid engaging in substantive discussions. John Boehner, once the center of the story, has lost significant influence, as evidenced by his inability to control the House and the shift of power to the Senate.\n\nThe final points of contention in the negotiations are relatively trivial compared to the consequences of inaction. These include the size of the debt limit increase, the duration of government funding, and the funding level. Democrats are pushing for a large debt limit increase and a brief stopgap funding bill, while Republicans are advocating for a smaller debt limit increase and a funding bill that reopens the government for several months.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has threatened to use the Senate's arcane procedural rules to push a deal past the October 17 deadline, unless he is guaranteed a vote on a measure to strip members and aides of their employer-provided health care compensation.\n\nAs the deadline approaches, it remains to be seen whether these remaining points of contention can be resolved, preventing a potential breach of the debt limit and averting a government shutdown.",
    " Title: Controversy Over Health Care Subsidies: A Legal and Political Battle\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing debate over health care subsidies under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has taken a new turn, with a legal and political battle unfolding on Capitol Hill. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that 23 million uninsured people will gain coverage through health insurance exchanges, with the majority qualifying for subsidies averaging over $6,000 per person annually. These subsidies, in the form of tax credits, will be available to individuals with incomes from the poverty level up to four times that amount ($23,050 to $92,200 for a family of four).\n\nThe controversy revolves around the interpretation of the ACA's language regarding premium subsidies. The law states that subsidies will be provided to residents of a state to help defray the cost of health plans offered \"through an exchange established by the state.\" A rule issued by the Obama administration allows tax credits for insurance bought in either a state or a federal exchange.\n\nRepresentative Phil Roe, a Republican from Tennessee, and other critics argue that this rule contradicts the explicit statutory language of the ACA. They have introduced a bill to nullify the rule, issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Douglas H. Shulman, the I.R.S. commissioner, defended the rule, stating that it is consistent with the intent of Congress, as the statute includes language that indicates individuals are eligible for tax credits whether they are enrolled through a state-based exchange or a federally facilitated exchange.\n\nHowever, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, accused the Obama administration of usurping the role of Congress and rewriting the law to provide tax credits through federal exchanges.\n\nThe dispute over subsidies involves a serious legal issue, according to James F. Blumstein, a professor of constitutional and health law at Vanderbilt University. He stated that the language of the statute is explicit, and subsidies accrue to people who obtain coverage through state-run exchanges. The I.R.S. tries to get around that by providing subsidies for all insurance exchanges, an interpretation that will almost certainly be challenged by someone.\n\nThe most likely challenger, according to Mr. Blumstein, is an employer penalized because one or more of its employees receive subsidies through a federal exchange. Employers may be subject to financial penalties if they offer no coverage or inadequate coverage and at least one of their full-time employees receives subsidies.\n\nMichael F. Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, emphasized the link between subsidies and penalties as a crucial part of the law. He stated that those tax credits trigger the penalties against employers, and if workers cannot receive subsidies in states with a federal exchange, their employers cannot be penalized. This, in turn, would hobble federal efforts to get employers to offer coverage in those states, according to Mr. Cannon.\n\nProf. Timothy S. Jost, an expert on health law at Washington and Lee University, argued that Congress made a \"drafting error\" that should be obvious to anyone who understands the new health care law. He stated that there is no coherent policy reason why Congress would have refused premium tax credits to the citizens of states that end up with a federal exchange.\n\nThe political brawling over health care will continue this week on Capitol Hill, with the House planning to vote on a Republican measure to repeal the ACA, President Obama's most significant legislative achievement. Democrats, who control the Senate, say repeal efforts have no chance of success there.",
    " Title: \"Implications of Nielsen's Resignation and the Future of DHS under McAleenan\"\n\nArticle:\n\nThe resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has sparked debate over the future direction of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan. Nielsen's departure follows a tumultuous tenure marked by the implementation of controversial immigration policies, including the family separation policy and the limitation of asylum-seekers.\n\nNielsen's critics, primarily from the left, have been highly critical of her tenure, viewing her as complicit in the administration's hardline immigration policies. However, they express concern that a replacement may be even more extreme, given Nielsen's refusal to comply with some of President Trump's more contentious demands, such as blocking all asylum seekers or resuming family separations.\n\nMcAleenan, the new acting secretary, has already shown differences in approach compared to Nielsen. He has praised the effectiveness of U.S. aid to Central America, a stance that puts him at odds with the president's decision to cut off assistance to those countries. McAleenan also refers to migrants arriving at the border as \"vulnerable families\" in need of humanitarian treatment, a stark contrast to Nielsen's approach.\n\nThe question remains whether McAleenan's approach aligns with the long-term goals of the president and his top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller. The delicate balance between securing the border and protecting vulnerable asylum seekers is a challenge that the new DHS leadership will need to navigate.\n\nThe resignation of Nielsen and other DHS officials has raised concerns about the future direction of the department. Some argue that the agency is entering a new era, one in which it will do whatever the Trump administration and Miller think it can get away with, given their nativist goals.\n\nThe immigration policies implemented during Nielsen's tenure have been met with criticism and legal challenges. The family separation policy, the limitation of asylum-seekers, and the policy preventing immigrants from applying for asylum if they entered the country illegally have all been subject to court rulings.\n\nThe resignation of Nielsen and the future of DHS under McAleenan is a topic of ongoing debate. The delicate balance between border security and humanitarian concerns will be a key issue moving forward. The circumstances surrounding Nielsen's resignation and the policies implemented during her tenure are likely to be a focus of ongoing investigation and discussion.",
    " Title: Iranian Officials Reject Trump's Offer for Unconditional Meeting with Iranian Leadership\n\nArticle:\n\nTensions between the United States and Iran escalated further this week as Iranian officials rejected a proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump for a meeting with no preconditions. The offer, made by Trump on Monday, follows a series of hostile exchanges between the two leaders earlier this month.\n\nIn response to Trump's offer, Iranian state media reported that politicians described such talks as having \"no value\" and a \"humiliation.\" The U.S. abandoned a nuclear deal in May that limited Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The U.S. is deeply suspicious of Iranian activity in the Middle East, and is an ally of Israel and Saudi Arabia, two of Iran's foes.\n\nTrump said he was open to meeting the Iranian side, stating, \"I'd meet with anybody. I believe in meetings... if they want to meet, we'll meet.\" Such a meeting would be the first between U.S. and Iranian leaders since before the 1979 Iranian revolution.\n\nHowever, Hamid Aboutalebi, an adviser to President Rouhani, tweeted in response to Trump that only \"returning to the nuclear deal\" and \"respecting the Iranian nation's rights\" would pave the way for talks. Iran's deputy speaker Ali Motahari told state news agency Irna that \"negotiation with the Americans would be a humiliation now.\"\n\nKamal Kharazi, the head of Iran's Strategic Council of Foreign Relations, said there was \"no value in Trump's proposal\" given Iran's \"bad experiences in negotiations with America\" and \"US officials' violations of their commitments.\"\n\nTrump has consistently opposed the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw the U.S. release billions of dollars of frozen assets in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear program. The Trump administration regards Iran as a destabilizing force in the Middle East, arguing the nuclear deal enabled Iran to pursue a more assertive regional policy. Iran has sent hundreds of troops and thousands of volunteer militiamen to Syria, and has strengthened its military presence there.\n\nGulf states have accused Iran of backing Yemen's Houthi rebels with both money and weapons, though Iran has denied this. Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally, is a major adversary of Iran and has repeatedly warned about Iran's intentions. In May, Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a \"horrible, one-sided deal.\" He alleged that the deal did not restrict Iran's \"destabilizing activities\" in the region enough.\n\nAnalysts also cited the influence of White House hawks including U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, and Trump's tendency to target major policies of his predecessor Barack Obama. Iran insists its nuclear program is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has said Iran is honoring its commitments. Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, with exports worth billions of dollars each year. It is already feeling economic pressures, and has seen large-scale protests over rising prices and a decline in the value of its currency, the rial.",
    " Title: Congresswomen Urge Inclusion of Student Debt Cancellation and Loan Relief in Upcoming COVID-19 Relief Package\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a joint public letter sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Representatives Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Alma Adams, and 28 additional members of Congress have called for the inclusion of student debt cancellation and loan relief in the next COVID-19 relief package. The letter, which was also signed by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Joe Kennedy III, argues that the current relief measures are insufficient in addressing the economic crisis caused by the pandemic.\n\nThe CARES Act, the first relief package, postponed payments for some federal student loan borrowers until September 2020. However, the congresswomen argue that more relief is necessary to match the severity and duration of the economic impact of the pandemic. The letter states, \"Public health experts and economists alike have estimated that our nation will feel the economic impact of this pandemic for up to 18 months.\"\n\nThe congresswomen propose three solutions to the student loan crisis. The most aggressive solution is a one-time cancellation of at least $30,000 for all federal student loan borrowers. This, they argue, would disproportionately benefit vulnerable borrowers, potentially eliminating the loan balance of millions of low-income people and borrowers of color.\n\nThe letter also calls for long-term payment relief for all federal student loan borrowers, including those with commercially held FFEL loans or Perkins Loans, who were excluded from the CARES Act's relief measures. The congresswomen urge Congress to extend relief to private loan borrowers as well, through cancellation, a suspension of payments and involuntary collections, and the opportunity to refinance any outstanding balance at lower interest rates.\n\nThroughout the letter, the congresswomen highlight the disproportionate impact of the student loan burden on communities of color, particularly Black and Latinx communities. They write, \"The unequal burden of this debt has fallen most heavily on low-income workers and families, communities of color, seniors, and even veterans who attended for-profit colleges.\"\n\nThe bill for the next COVID-19 relief package is expected next week. The letter serves as a call to action for Congress to address the student loan crisis and provide relief to those most affected by the pandemic and the burden of student debt.",
    " Title: ISIS Blows Up Assyrian Church in Tal Nasri, Syria During Easter Celebrations\n\nArticle:\n\nAssyrian Christians in Syria were celebrating Easter Sunday when militants from the Islamic State (ISIS) detonated an 80-year-old church in Tal Nasri village, located in the western countryside of Hasaka province. The church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was one of three main churches in the Assyrian village and was built in 1934.\n\nSince February, Tal Nasri has been under the control of ISIS, led by self-proclaimed Caliph al-Baghdadi. Kurdish militias and Christian fighters have been attempting to regain control of the village for some time. According to reports, ISIS jihadists booby-trapped the church with explosives before detonating it.\n\nThe Assyrian International News Agency (AINA) reported that the church has been \"leveled.\" Christians, who make up just 10% of Syria's mostly Muslim Sunni population, have had to limit their Easter celebrations to prayers and masses due to the ongoing conflict in the country.\n\nThe bombing is the latest in a series of acts of destruction by ISIS, who have targeted places of worship in the areas they control. ISIS has destroyed numerous religious sites and shrines, including temples, Sufi mosques, and churches, as well as destroying statues and archaeological finds with pickaxes.\n\nIn recent days, ISIS released a propaganda video showing a group of men destroying statues and parts of the facade of an old building in Hatra, a city of the ancient Parthian Empire. Another image released by ISIS shows the destruction of the monastery of Mar Behnam in Iraq.\n\nIn February, Islamist militants burned down the historic church of Tal Hurmoz, one of the oldest churches in Syria, and destroyed three other churches in the town of Tal Tamer in Hasaka province.

    " Title: Vice President Mike Pence Denies 2020 Presidential Run Speculation, Calls New York Times Report \"Fake News\"\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday denied that he is preparing for a presidential election run in 2020, saying the suggestion is \"disgraceful and offensive.\"\n\nIn response to a New York Times report that some Republicans were moving to form a \"shadow campaign\" as though President Donald Trump were not involved, Pence called the article \"fake news\" and said his entire team was focused on advancing Trump's agenda and seeing him re-elected in 2020.\n\nThe Times report said Pence had not only kept a full political calendar but also had created his own independent power base, including a political fund-raising group called the \"Great America Committee.\" However, Pence's statement on Sunday contradicted the report's claims.\n\n\"The allegations in this article are categorically false and represent just the latest attempt by the media to divide this Administration,\" Pence said in a statement.\n\nThe Times stood by its coverage. \"We are confident in the accuracy of our reporting and will let the story speak for itself,\" New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said in an email.\n\nPence has good relations with conservative political groups and some of the Republican Party's big donors, including billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. He is also a Trump loyalist, and there is typically little distinction between his public statements and the policies of the president.\n\nHowever, as investigations deepen into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible ties to members of Trump's campaign, Pence has put some distance between himself and the president on the best way to approach Moscow.\n\nOn a trip to Eastern Europe last week, Pence condemned Russia's presence in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, with which Moscow fought a brief war in 2008. He also said ties with Russia would not improve until Moscow changed its stance on Ukraine and withdrew support for countries like Iran, Syria, and North Korea.\n\nThe U.S. Congress recently passed a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia with overwhelming bipartisan support, but Trump signed it into law last week with reluctance.\n\n\"Our relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous low,\" Trump wrote on Twitter after signing the bill. \"You can thank Congress.\"\n\nTrump has described probes into his campaign's ties to Russia, including those underway in Congress and a Justice Department investigation headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThe president has also sent mixed messages on whether he agrees with U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusions that Russia tried to intervene in the 2016 election to boost his chances of beating Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhite House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway on Sunday also dismissed the idea that Pence was looking at running for president in 2020.\n\n\"It is absolutely true that the vice president is getting ready for 2020 - for re-election as vice president,\" Conway told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday. \"Vice President Pence is a very loyal, very dutiful, but also incredibly effective vice president, and active vice president,\" said Conway, adding that she had worked for Pence for a decade as his pollster and senior adviser.",
    " Title: Americans Favorably View Many Federal Agencies, Including CDC and HHS, Amidst COVID-19 Outbreak\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent survey conducted by \u2588\u2588\u2588, it was found that Americans hold broadly favorable views of several federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which are at the forefront of dealing with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted in March 2020 among 1,013 U.S. adults, found that 79% of respondents have a favorable opinion of the CDC, with large majorities of both Republicans (84%) and Democrats (77%) expressing positive views. The survey also revealed that views of the CDC among Republicans have grown more positive in recent years, while Democrats' views have shown less change.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also received broadly favorable ratings, with 80% of respondents viewing the agency positively. This is a significant increase in positive views among Republicans, who feel far more favorably toward HHS than they did during the Obama administration.\n\nThe survey found that more than three years into the Trump administration, larger shares of Republicans than Democrats express favorable opinions of eight of the ten government agencies included in the survey. The other two agencies, the Postal Service and the IRS, received nearly identical majorities in both parties with favorable opinions.\n\nThe survey also found that Republicans' views of the Justice Department improved after Donald Trump's election, while Democrats turned more negative. However, favorable views of the DOJ have increased sharply since September, with 76% of Republicans viewing the department favorably, up from 61% last fall and the highest positive rating for the department in polling going back a decade. By comparison, 50% of Democrats feel favorably toward the Justice Department, little changed from the fall and among the lowest ratings in a decade.\n\nViews of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) remain polarized, with 77% of Republicans and Republican leaners viewing the agency favorably, compared with only 28% of Democrats and Democratic leaners.\n\nThe Census Bureau, which is currently conducting the decennial census, received positive views from 77% of Americans overall, with just 12% holding an unfavorable view. The survey also found that ratings of the Postal Service continue to stand out, with an overwhelming 91% saying they have a favorable view of the mail delivery service.\n\nThe survey found that nine of the ten agencies included in the survey are viewed more favorably than unfavorably by the public, with ICE being the only agency for which about equal shares express an unfavorable (45%) as favorable (46%) view. Among the agencies viewed in a positive light, the majorities viewing each favorably range from 91% for the Postal Service to 60% for the Justice Department.\n\nThe survey also found that for many federal agencies, there are only modest differences in ratings between Republicans and Democrats. For instance, large majorities of Republicans and Democrats have favorable views of the Postal Service, Census Bureau, CDC, and HHS. However, the survey found that a broader majority of Republicans (86%) than of Democrats (60%) view the Department of Homeland Security favorably. The partisan gap is similar in views of the DOJ.\n\nThe widest partisan divide in the survey is in assessments of ICE, with Republicans and Republican leaners being 49 points more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to hold a favorable view of the agency (77% vs. 28%). The share of Republicans with a favorable view of ICE has increased 7 points since September 2019, while among Democrats, ratings of ICE remain overwhelmingly negative (64% view the agency unfavorably), though the share with a favorable view has increased since last fall (up 9 points). The overall gap in ratings of ICE between Republicans and Democrats remains about the same as it has been over the last few years.\n\nAs the Census Bureau launches its decennial census, majorities of both Republicans and Democrats hold positive views of the agency. Republicans' views of the Census Bureau have grown considerably more positive over the last two years, with 83% of Republicans viewing the Census Bureau favorably, compared with 66% who held a favorable view of the agency in 2018. Among Democrats, views of the Census Bureau have remained relatively stable, with about three-quarters of Democrats (76%) saying they hold favorable views of the agency today, views were similar in 2019 and 2018.",
    " Title: Amtrak-CSX Train Collision in South Carolina Leaves Two Dead, 116 Injured\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a tragic turn of events, a collision between an Amtrak passenger train and a CSX freight train in Cayce, South Carolina, early Sunday morning has resulted in two fatalities and 116 injuries. The incident occurred at approximately 2:35 am, with Amtrak Train 91, en route from New York to Miami, colliding with the CSX train.\n\nAccording to reports, the Amtrak train derailed, carrying eight crewmembers and 139 passengers. The injured individuals were transported to local hospitals, with injuries ranging from minor scratches to broken bones. Approximately 5,000 gallons of fuel were spilled, but authorities have stated that there is \"no threat to the public at this time.\"\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has been called to investigate the incident. This is the second fatal crash involving an Amtrak train in recent weeks.\n\nSouth Carolina Governor Henry McMaster stated that the Amtrak train was on the wrong track, while the CSX freight train, which was unoccupied, was on its designated track. Amtrak stated that CSX owns and maintains the area where the collision occurred, with CSX controlling the dispatching of all trains and directing the signal systems.\n\nRobert Sumwalt, NTSB Chairman, has stated that a priority in the investigation is to recover data recorders to determine the speed of the Amtrak train at the point of collision.\n\nPassengers on the train, such as Derek Pettaway, have shared their experiences. Pettaway, a passenger on one of the train's rear cars, was awakened by the impact and helped off the train quickly by the crew. He was discharged from the hospital with minor whiplash and is currently staying at Pine Ridge Middle School, where a shelter has been set up for passengers.\n\nLocal reporter Chad Mills reported that sources indicate the casualty number is not expected to rise, and the incident was a close call.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been briefed on the incident and is receiving regular updates. The White House deputy press secretary, Lindsay Walters, stated that the president's thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the incident. The president also addressed the incident on Twitter.\n\nThe exact cause of the crash, as well as the speed of both trains at the time of the collision, is still under investigation.",
    " Title: President Obama Lifts U.S. Arms Embargo Against Vietnam, Boosting Defense Capabilities and Regional Stability\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards normalizing relations, President Barack Obama on Monday fully lifted the United States' 41-year arms embargo against Vietnam. The decision, made during Obama's visit to Hanoi, marks a milestone in the evolving relationship between the two nations.\n\nAt a press conference, President Obama stated, \"This change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself and removes a lingering vestige of the Cold War.\" He further added, \"The decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other considerations, but was based on our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards normalization with Vietnam.\"\n\nWhile the move is expected to bolster Vietnam's defense capabilities against China, President Obama denied that this was a primary motivation. He emphasized that the decision was more reflective of the changing nature of the relationship between the two countries.\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. partially lifted the embargo, but Vietnam sought full access as it navigates China's land reclamation and military construction in the disputed South China Sea. Notably, Vietnam has not made any arms purchases, but the removal of the remaining restrictions signals that relations are fully normalized and paves the way for deeper security cooperation.\n\nIn response, China's Foreign Ministry issued a statement, expressing hope that \"normal and friendly\" relations between the U.S. and Vietnam would contribute to regional stability. China itself remains under a weapons embargo imposed by the U.S. and the European Union following the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.\n\nPresident Obama and Vietnamese leaders discussed maritime issues and the importance of maintaining freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. The U.S. does not take sides on the territorial disputes, but supports a diplomatic resolution based on \"international norms\" and not on \"who's the bigger party and can throw around their weight a little bit more,\" a reference to China.\n\nWhile the announcement is a significant step towards normalizing relations with Vietnam, President Obama clarified that the country will not immediately receive a flood of weapons. Each U.S. arms sale will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, he said, and will still need to meet strict requirements, including those related to human rights.\n\nActivists and members of Congress had hoped the president would wait to fully lift the embargo until Vietnam improved its human rights record.",
    " Title: Diverse Candidates Make History: A Look at the Trailblazing Winners in the 2018 Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a groundbreaking election, diverse candidates have broken barriers across the United States, changing the face of Congress and statehouses. Women, Native Americans, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants, millennials, and LGBT candidates have already made history with their campaigns. Here are some of the key trailblazing candidates who have already won their races so far.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 29-year-old progressive challenger, made history as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress after unseating a 10-term New York congressman in June. Ayanna Pressley, the first black woman to serve on Boston's city council, made history again after defeating the 10-term incumbent Michael Capuano in the primary and becoming the first black member of the House of Representatives from Massachusetts.\n\nRashida Tlaib, a democratic socialist, has become the nation's first Palestinian-American woman in Congress and one of two Muslim women elected on Tuesday. Ilhan Omar, also the first Somali-American in Congress, is a former refugee who pushed a progressive agenda in her state legislature.\n\nJared Polis, the Democratic nominee for governor in Colorado, ran on a left-wing platform and has become the first openly gay governor in the United States. Kate Brown, who is bisexual, became the first openly LGBT person elected governor in 2016. Sharice Davids, an attorney and former MMA fighter, became the first Native American congresswoman and the first lesbian congresswoman from Kansas.\n\nDeb Haaland, a citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe, became the first Native American woman to chair a state political party and the first Native American congresswoman in the US. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, became the first female senator in Tennessee's history. Maine has elected its first female governor, Janet Mills, who is replacing a controversial and bombastic Republican governor, Paul LePage.\n\nAbby Finkenauer, a 29-year-old two-term Democratic state representative, became the first woman elected to Congress from Iowa. Jahana Hayes, the 2016 National Teacher of the Year and first-time political candidate, won her bid to represent Connecticut's fifth congressional district, becoming the first black woman to represent the state in Congress.\n\nVeronica Escobar and Sylvia Garcia, both former county judges, became the first Latina congresswomen from Texas. More than a third of the population of the Lone Star state may be Latino, but until Tuesday, no Latina had been elected to represent the state in Congress.\n\nThese trailblazing candidates are diversifying American politics and breaking barriers, and we will continue to update this article as more results come in.",

The incident occurred Monday evening, hours after Battel's inadvertent insults went viral.\n\nAccording to an exclusive report by The Daily Caller, Battel, whose LinkedIn and Facebook pages seemed to have been disabled, phoned Mr. James' campaign Monday afternoon seeking an interview for Wednesday to discuss Election Day's results. Thinking she had hung up the phone, Battel expressed her dismay at the prospect of Mr. James, an African-American Army veteran, potentially defeating incumbent Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow.\n\nIn the voicemail, Battel reportedly exclaimed, \"Man, if he beats her \u2026 Jesus!\" She followed this with, \"Whew, that would suck! But I don't think that's going to happen though.\"\n\nThe voice message, with Battel's contact information removed, quickly spread online and, within hours, she was out of a job.\n\n\"I have listened to Brenda Battel's voicemail left for Mr. James' campaign, and find no reason to defend this behavior,\" said Kate Hessling, editor of The Huron Daily Tribune, in a statement. \"Brenda Battel's employment has been immediately terminated.\"\n\n\"The Huron Daily Tribune sincerely apologizes to Mr. James and to the public,\" Ms. Hessling's statement continued. \"These statements do not represent the views of the Tribune as a whole, nor do they reflect the actions of a responsible journalist.\"\n\nAs of Monday night, The Huron Daily Tribune's website did not list Battel among the two reporters on staff. She had not responded to requests for comment Monday afternoon and was not reachable on Tuesday.\n\nAs Election Day approached, Mr. James found himself trailing Ms. Stabenow by 8.3 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics polling average. However, this marked an improvement from the double-digit deficits Mr. James had through most of October, and some polls showed an even closer margin.\n\n\"It shows you that some media will do anything to keep the status quo and career politicians in power,\" Tori Sachs, Mr. James' campaign manager, told The Daily Caller in an email. \"The liberal media can't stand the idea of a job creator and combat veteran coming to Washington to shake up the system.

    " Title: Tentative Deal Emerges from Trump-Kim Summit in Vietnam: A Closer Look at the Proposed Agreement and Its Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nA tentative deal between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, has emerged as a potential outcome of their upcoming summit in Vietnam. While the agreement remains subject to change, the current terms appear to offer significant concessions to North Korea, raising questions about the balance of gains for both parties.\n\nAccording to three sources familiar with the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues, the U.S. would agree to lift some sanctions and improve ties with North Korea in exchange for a commitment from Kim Jong Un to close down a key nuclear facility, Yongbyon.\n\nThe proposed deal includes the following key points:\n\n1. A peace declaration, symbolically ending the Korean War, which technically remains ongoing due to the 1953 armistice. This declaration would significantly improve relations between the two countries.\n2. North Korea's agreement to return more remains of U.S. troops who died during the Korean War, although the number and timing are yet to be determined. Last year, North Korea returned the remains of 55 American service members following the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore.\n3. The establishment of liaison offices in each other's nations, marking the first concrete step toward normalizing diplomatic ties between the two longtime adversaries.\n4. North Korea's commitment to stop producing materials for nuclear bombs at the Yongbyon facility. In exchange, the U.S. will push for the lifting of some United Nations sanctions on Pyongyang, allowing it to pursue joint economic projects with South Korea.\n\nIt is also possible that the deal will include other nuclear facilities, one source said.\n\nWhile the deal may represent a significant step forward in reducing tensions and improving relations between the U.S. and North Korea, experts have raised concerns about the potential concessions made by the U.S. in exchange for North Korea's commitment to close the Yongbyon facility. The facility is considered the \"heart\" of North Korea's nuclear program, and its closure would significantly impact the country's ability to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons.\n\nHowever, the agreement's specifics regarding the closure of the Yongbyon facility and the timeline for North Korea to end nuclear fuel production remain unclear. The U.S. and North Korea will reportedly finalize the details in future talks.\n\nExperts have emphasized the importance of verifiable and detailed agreements to ensure that North Korea follows through on its commitments. Without international inspections, it is difficult to confirm whether North Korea has complied with its promises.\n\nIn the event that the U.S. lifts sanctions before North Korea fully dismantles its nuclear program, critics argue that the U.S. would have offered significant concessions without receiving substantive commitments in return.\n\nIn summary, the proposed deal between Trump and Kim offers a potential path toward improved relations and reduced tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. However, the deal's effectiveness in achieving denuclearization remains uncertain, and experts have raised concerns about the balance of concessions offered by both parties. The success of the deal will depend on the details of the agreement, the follow-through by both sides, and the potential for future negotiations to address the remaining challenges in achieving denuclearization.",
    " Title: Vice President Pence Reveals Funding Source of Migrant Caravan, Glenn Beck Discusses Implications\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Vice President Mike Pence has revealed during a media briefing on Tuesday that the migrant caravan currently making its way towards the southern U.S. border was organized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela, according to President Donald Trump. This revelation has sparked a series of discussions, including on \"The Glenn Beck Radio Program\" on Wednesday.\n\nGlenn Beck, in his program, questioned the media's lack of concern regarding the caravan, stating, \"Have you noticed that the press is not concerned at all about this caravan? They say the caravan's not going to make it up to the United States, that it's just nonsense and why are they talking about it. Really?\"\n\nBeck noted that the 7,000-person-strong migrant caravan appears to be both a political message and a weapon. He suggested that the migrant invasion force was organized in Honduras by a leftist political party aiming to embarrass the current right-wing government. However, he pointed out that this information is not widely reported by mainstream news outlets.\n\nBeck also raised questions about the funding of the caravan, stating, \"Who is writing the check for all of this?\" He suggested that Venezuelan President Maduro, despite financial struggles, could be using the caravan as a means to attack the United States by organizing and funding thousands of people to flood the border.\n\nBeck further discussed the potential implications, including economic warfare, destabilization of the U.S. political structure, and the possibility of criminal elements or spies using the caravan as cover to enter the country.\n\nListeners can watch the full discussion on TheBlaze TV, with subscribers having on-demand access.

    " Title: The Controversy Over Transgender Issues and Compelled Speech in American Law\n\nArticle:\n\nA growing intolerance of disagreement in the debate over transgender issues is beginning to manifest in law, with some states and federal agencies mandating the use of preferred pronouns for individuals identifying as transgender. This issue has sparked heated debates, with some arguing that such pronoun mandates infringe on freedom of speech and the right to conscience.\n\nYesterday, a journalist faced backlash on Twitter for using male pronouns to describe Chelsea Manning, a transgender woman who was recently released from prison. The journalist was accused of transphobia and received a series of profane and offensive tweets. This incident highlights the growing sentiment among transgender activists that any deviation from their preferred pronouns is a form of discrimination.\n\nIn New York City, the government has enacted a law that punishes employers, landlords, businesses, and professionals who use the \"wrong\" pronouns. The New York City Human Rights Commission defines a violation as \"refusal to use an individual's preferred name, pronoun, or title because they do not conform to gender stereotypes.\" For example, calling a woman \"Mr.\" because her appearance is aligned with traditional gender-based stereotypes of masculinity.\n\nThe Obama administration also put the issue of pronouns at the forefront of every federally funded educational institution in the United States. The administration issued guidance (since repealed) that mandated schools to treat students consistent with their gender identity, even if their education records or identification documents indicate a different sex. This guidance also required school staff and contractors to use pronouns and names consistent with a transgender student's gender identity.\n\nCritics argue that these pronoun mandates are a violation of the rights of conscience of the speaker and a form of compelled speech. They argue that it is a government effort to coerce verbal agreement with a contested and contentious personal, religious, cultural, and scientific debate.\n\nThe journalist who faced backlash on Twitter for using male pronouns to describe Chelsea Manning argues that using male pronouns is not an act of bigotry, but a reflection of biological reality. The journalist states, \"I'm simply telling the truth. I'm reflecting biological reality, and I'm referring to the created order as outlined in Genesis 1 \u2014 'So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.'\"\n\nThe journalist also argues that this issue is not a matter of manners, but a fundamental principle of truth and freedom of speech. The journalist states, \"When your definition of manners requires that I verbally consent to a fundamentally false and important premise, then I dissent. You can not use my manners to win your culture war. I will speak respectfully, I will never use a pronoun with the intent of causing harm, and if I encounter a person in obvious emotional distress I will choose my words very carefully. But I will not say what I do not believe.\"\n\nThe journalist also argues that the issue of transgender identity is a contentious and complex issue that should be open to reasonable debate, but that dissent from this issue is often seen as a \"tell\" for underlying bigotry. The journalist states, \"Other issues can be debated, but not this one. This is beyond reasonable disagreement.\"\n\nThe debate over transgender issues and compelled speech is a complex and contentious issue that requires careful consideration and respect for all parties involved. It is important to ensure that laws and policies are fair, just, and respect the rights of all individuals, while also protecting freedom of speech and the right to conscience.",
    " Title: U.S. Stocks Experience Broad-Based Decline as Government Shutdown Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, U.S. stocks witnessed a broad-based retreat on Friday, as the impending government shutdown seemed increasingly inevitable. The budgetary standoff between President Trump and Senate Democrats over border wall funding has left investors resigned to the prospect of a government shutdown.\n\nEarlier this week, the U.S. House had passed a spending package that included $5 billion for President Trump's campaign-promised border wall. However, in the Senate, where 60 votes are required for passage of the spending bill, the measure appeared dead on arrival.\n\nThe market initially rose after the opening bell on Friday, as a durable goods report and a revision to the third-quarter gross domestic product - both somewhat weaker than expected - indicated that the Federal Reserve might have less reason to raise interest rates.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) stood at 27,783.59, with a gain of 92.10 or 0.33%. The S&P 500 (SP500) was at 3,094.04, with a rise of 2.20 or 0.07%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index (COMP) was at 8,482.10, with a decrease of 3.99 or 0.05%.\n\nAs the session progressed and a government shutdown appeared more likely, the market experienced a broad-based decline. Shares of big capitalization and big tech companies led the retreat. Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell below the $1,000 level for the first time since April 4. The shares entered a bear market on Thursday and are currently down almost 23% from its record close of $1,285.50 on July 26.\n\nShares of packaged foods company Conagra Brands tumbled to a 52-week low after the company missed sales expectations. Other tech giants like Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN) also experienced declines.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. shares tumbled, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling nearly 500 points or about 2% and sliding below 23,000 for the first time in 14 months. Along with the blue-chip index, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also plummeted, now flirting with bear market territory. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 lost over 1% during the session. At the same time, volatility spiked to the highest level since February.\n\nThe selling accelerated after President Trump told House Republican leaders on Thursday that he will not sign a Senate-passed spending package that does not include sought-after border security funds, upending negotiations to avert a government shutdown by the end of the week, as reported by Fox News.\n\nInternational markets also experienced volatility. Japan's Nikkei finished the session lower by 1.1% and down 5.6% for the week. China's Shanghai Composite ended the day down 0.8% and off 3% for the week. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed out the day higher by 0.5%, but fell 1.3% for the week. In European trading, London's FTSE traded little changed, Germany's DAX added 0.2%, and France's CAC was little changed.",
    " Title: Gary Johnson's Presidential Campaign Gains Momentum: A Look at His Appeal and the Libertarian Party's Progress\n\nArticle:\n\nGary Johnson, the Libertarian Party's presidential candidate, has been making waves in his campaign, with appearances in various cities, including Miami and Las Vegas. In Las Vegas, Johnson addressed a \"high energy\" crowd, emphasizing his commitment to individual choice and limited government intervention.\n\nAccording to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Johnson expressed his support for gay marriage, abortion rights, and the legalization of marijuana. He also criticized the death penalty as a flawed public policy. In Nevada, Johnson expressed optimism about the November referendum that could legalize recreational marijuana for adults over 21.\n\nThe Libertarian Party duo, Johnson and his running mate, William Weld, are hopeful about meeting the Commission on Presidential Debates' 15 percent in five polls threshold, although they may not reach it by the first debate on September 26. Weld suggested that if they don't meet the polling benchmark for the initial debate, they could still become eligible for a later debate, with the final debate scheduled for October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\nCoalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol spokesman Joe Brezny, who ran the Nevada campaign for Mitt Romney's presidential bid four years ago, has announced his support for Johnson and Weld. Brezny, a Republican, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Republican Party's nomination process, stating, \"I've watched some good people nominate the least electable person in mankind.\"\n\nWeld, during his speech, emphasized the fiscal conservatism he and Johnson demonstrated during their gubernatorial tenures as a necessary approach for Washington D.C. Johnson, in turn, pledged to present Congress with a balanced budget within the first 100 days of his presidency.\n\nMontana political analysts and watchers believe Johnson could easily double his 3 percent from 2012, citing the state's history of supporting non-major party candidates. In 2012, Libertarian candidate Dan Cox received 6.5 percent of the vote in Montana's Senate race, which some analysts speculate may have prevented Republican Denny Rehberg from beating incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat.\n\nJohnson is set to appear in Maine on August 26. Heidi Sawyer, the creator of the popular Lewiston Rocks Facebook page, expressed her support for Johnson, stating, \"For me, Johnson represents fiscal conservatism, small government, not wasteful spending, a government where more money would go to classrooms and where they'd make sense.\" Sawyer, who identifies as fiscally conservative and socially liberal, was intrigued by Johnson's stance on issues like marijuana legalization and non-interventionist foreign policy.\n\nIn Maine, the Libertarian Party needs to have \"10,000 registered voters who are enrolled in the party cast ballots in the General Election,\" to maintain ballot status as an official party, according to the state government. This requirement was a significant hurdle that the party overcame to secure a place on the ballot this year.\n\nIn a campaign email, the Johnson-Weld team reported raising $3 million from 92,000 distinct donors in just this month, which could potentially put them at risk of receiving Secret Service protection if they reach $10 million in direct campaign donations.\n\nThe Libertarian Party's progress and Johnson's appeal are gaining attention, with many voters looking for alternatives to the two major political parties. As the election approaches, the party's position on the ballot and Johnson's appeal could significantly impact the political landscape of the United States.",
    " Title: Potential Third-Party Presidential Run by Donald Trump Could Complicate GOP Election Prospects\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Donald Trump's controversial comments and the Republican National Committee's (RNC) public rebuke, the possibility of a third-party presidential run by the billionaire businessman is causing concern among the GOP establishment. The potential scenario of a populist outsider attacking the Republican nominee from the right during the general election, with his inflammatory rhetoric on issues like illegal immigration, could prove detrimental for the party.\n\nRalph Nader, a multiple-time third-party presidential candidate who is believed to have cost Democrat Al Gore the 2000 election by running to his left, warned that the Republican Party establishment is \"playing with nitroglycerine\" when they go after Trump and attempt to minimize or exclude him. According to Nader, a jilted Trump as a third-party candidate could \"blow the presidential race wide open and turn it into a three-way race.\"\n\nTrump has become a target of criticism since launching his White House campaign last month, angering fellow Republicans with his comments on Sen. John McCain's war hero status. In response, Trump has fired back at the criticism, especially the rebuke from the typically-neutral RNC. He has repeatedly declined to rule out a third-party White House run, stating in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper earlier this month that he is constantly being asked to run as an independent. This week, he told The Hill that his decision will depend on \"how I'm being treated by the Republicans.\"\n\nLaunching a third-party candidacy is a complex and expensive process, with logistical hurdles such as massive signature-gathering requirements to gain ballot access in each of the 50 states. However, for a candidate with significant financial resources, it is a feasible option. The example of businessman Ross Perot's independent candidacy for president in 1992 demonstrates this, as his campaign is widely considered to have complicated George H.W. Bush's effort to win reelection against Bill Clinton.\n\nClay Mulford, Perot's son-in-law and political adviser, suggested that a third-party run from Trump could energize a segment of the electorate seeking a fresh face. \"There is just a sense of ineffectiveness of the two-party system,\" Mulford said. \"So I think he would do better than expected if he were in the debates and if he were considered viable.\"\n\nIndeed, poll numbers suggest that a third-party candidacy from Trump would damage Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a top-tier candidate in the current Republican field. In a head-to-head match-up, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton leads Bush, 50% to 44%, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released this week. However, when an independent Trump is added to the race, Clinton's lead grows significantly to 46%, leaving Bush at 30%.\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. Dean Barkley of Minnesota, who was appointed and served briefly as an independent by Gov. Jesse Ventura, stated that independents \"decide the election every four years\" and that if most of them or all of them went to Trump, the Republicans would not have a chance of winning.\n\nAt a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Thursday, Bush emphasized that he is not dismissive of Trump's candidacy. \"I think he's a serious candidate and he's going to have a lot of money,\" Bush said. \"He's tapping into people's angst that are legitimate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Laredo, Texas, on Thursday, Trump reiterated his preference to run as a Republican and expressed confidence in his ability to win the party's nomination. However, in many ways, a third-party run makes sense for Trump, given his history as a registered Democrat, donations to members of both parties, and his self-proclaimed anti-politician status.\n\nTrump's comments on illegal immigration and his critique of Sen. John McCain have caused significant backlash, with many Republicans viewing his words as hurtful and insensitive. The RNC's condemnation of Trump is likely to have fueled his unorthodox campaign, as many who dismissed him earlier have already done so. Political consultant Bill Hillsman, who has worked for a number of independent candidates, stated that the damage is already done to a large extent. \"I think the damage is already done to a large extent,\" Hillsman said. \"All the people who said well, his campaign is over now and blasted him for some of his previous comments, many of which he's walked back, they already have just pretty much dismissed this guy and the polls are saying otherwise.\"",
    " Title: U.S. Braces for Potential Second Wave of COVID-19 and Influenza Coinciding in Winter\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the United States grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, health officials are bracing for a potential second wave of infections later this year, coinciding with the peak of the 2020-21 influenza season. The concern is that the combined surge of both viruses could lead to a new wave of hospital patients in need of respiratory support.\n\nThe fear is justified, as both COVID-19 and influenza infections typically begin rising in November and peak at some point in December, January, or February, before subsiding by April. The severity of each wave will depend on factors such as the match between the vaccine and the virus strain, the particular strain itself, and human behavior.\n\nWhile influenza infection patterns are better understood, influenza remains a known unknown due to the annual variation in strains. The severity of the 2017-18 influenza season resulted in the death of an estimated 80,000 Americans, the highest such toll in at least 40 years. The behavior of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a much greater unknown, with our understanding mostly based on the behavior of the four cold-causing coronaviruses that have been circulating in the U.S. since at least the 1960s.\n\nThe seasonality of viral infections remains a mystery, with theories suggesting that cold, dry weather and indoor gatherings may facilitate transmission. However, other viruses like polio and cold-causing rhinoviruses peak in summer, and the mystery deepens when considering viruses that are seasonal in temperate climates but maintain a near-constant infection rate in the tropics.\n\nThe main factor influencing the magnitude of a second wave of infections is the number of people actively infected by the virus in October, often referred to as the human reservoir. Limiting the number of infections now will reduce the number of infections later. Unfortunately, the U.S. is not limiting COVID-19 infections enough to avoid a severe second wave.\n\nCountries that have successfully tackled the disease have implemented exhaustive contact-tracing programs and broad testing regimes, moving potentially infected individuals to supervised facilities for monitoring. As U.S. communities reopen and behavior patterns loosen, the consequences of insufficient action will become apparent.\n\nWith seven vaccines and at least one drug with prophylactic potential currently in clinical trials, efforts to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission are underway. However, a vaccine or prophylactic drug must be widely available by the very beginning of the season to have an impact on a second wave of U.S. infections this autumn. Without a medical breakthrough, the U.S. will have to prepare for the worst.",
    " Title: GOP Divisions in Congress Aid Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in Sequester Standoff\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing political stalemate in Mitch McConnell's Republican caucus is inadvertently benefiting Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, as the Great Sequester standoff in Washington reaches its climax in the Senate on Thursday. The Senate is still divided over how to disarm the impending budget cuts, with Democrats and President Barack Obama observing from the sidelines.\n\nAs the deadline for the sequester looms on March 1, Obama will meet with House and Senate leaders on Friday, while his Office of Management and Budget works to meet the deadline for implementing the $85.3 billion in cuts. New battle lines are being drawn over funding the government beyond March 27, with Senate Democrats expressing renewed interest in a full-year omnibus spending package.\n\nHowever, Thursday in the Senate will be dominated by the sequester debate, with the focus shifting from finding solutions to political cover. With no clear path to the 60 votes needed for passage, the cuts are likely to be ordered on Friday night. Even achieving 50 votes will be a challenge for the GOP alternative.\n\nThe Republican leadership has pushed ahead with a controversial plan to grant the White House broad authority to implement the sequester for the remainder of the fiscal year. The final 10-page bill, released Wednesday evening, requires Obama to present his own plan to achieve the same level of cuts by March 15. Lawmakers could overrule the president's plan, but this would require a two-thirds majority in both houses, an unlikely event.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled his support for the plan early in the day, but the strategy, crafted by Sen. Pat Toomey, continues to face resistance, even from supporters who express reservations about ceding power to the president.\n\nConservatives argue that alternative proposals, such as Sen. Kelly Ayotte's bill, fail to match the immediate deficit reduction promised for 2013. For the moment, Republican divisions are aiding Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who has enjoyed surprising unity behind his own plan to forestall the cuts for 10 months by substituting a package of $110 billion in revenues and alternative savings.",
    " Title: Media's Reaction to Trump's Hydroxychloroquine Use: A Call for Conscientious Coverage\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, President Donald Trump has announced that he is taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against contracting COVID-19. This revelation has sparked a flurry of reactions, with some media outlets and political figures expressing concern, while others have criticized the response as hysterical and irresponsible.\n\nThe use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 is still a subject of ongoing research, with early studies yielding mixed results. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has recently begun a controlled clinical trial to further investigate the drug's effectiveness. While there is no consensus on its therapeutic value, few argue that it is a useful prophylactic.\n\nThe media's reaction to Trump's decision to self-medicate has been met with criticism for its sensationalist and alarmist tone. For instance, a CNN columnist warned of \"the danger in Trump's decision to self-medicate,\" while the New York Times' Michelle Goldberg noted the rare side effects of the drug, such as paranoia, hallucinations, and psychosis.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called Trump's remarks about hydroxychloroquine \"dangerous,\" but for the general public, the drug itself is no more dangerous than a vast number of pharmaceuticals used every day by millions of Americans to help them live with less pain or to keep them alive.\n\nThe most reckless media personality on the issue has been Trump's former bestie, Joe Scarborough, who repeatedly told his audience this morning that hydroxychloroquine will \"kill you.\" However, it is important to note that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not stated that hydroxychloroquine \"will kill you.\" Instead, the FDA has noted that there are elevated risks associated with COVID-19 patients taking the medication.\n\nThe conscientious way to cover Trump's hydroxychloroquine usage would be to point out that there is no proof that the drug will help treat the coronavirus, though tests are still ongoing. Instead, we are subjected to an overwrought lecture series of nasty, childish, partisan attacks and misleading stories about a couple ingesting fish-tank cleaner.\n\nIt is worth noting that hydroxychloroquine has been approved for 70 years and is prescribed daily by doctors for various conditions. If Trump and his doctor think it is okay for him to take it, that is his business. The fearmongering and sensationalist coverage of the drug are not helping anyone and are causing unnecessary alarm among the public.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important for the media to approach the issue of hydroxychloroquine use with a sense of responsibility and a commitment to factual reporting. The drug's effectiveness as a treatment for COVID-19 is still a subject of ongoing research, and it is important to report on the latest developments accurately and without sensationalism. The media's role is to inform the public, not to incite fear and panic.",
    " Title: New Fox News Latino Poll Shows Hillary Clinton Widening Lead Among Hispanic Voters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development for the upcoming presidential election, a new national survey conducted by Fox News Latino has shown Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton widening her lead over her Republican rival, Donald Trump, among Hispanic voters. The poll, released on Thursday, indicates that Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, enjoy a substantial 46-point lead over Trump and his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted among registered voters, shows Clinton and Kaine garnering 66 percent of the Hispanic vote, while Trump and Pence receive 20 percent. This 7-point increase in Clinton's lead since the same poll in May indicates a growing preference among Hispanic voters for the Democratic ticket.\n\nThe Hispanic vote is crucial to Clinton's electoral strategy, which aims to assemble a coalition of young voters, minorities, and women. In the 2012 election, Hispanics provided significant support that helped secure President Obama's victory over Republican Mitt Romney.\n\nThe Republican Party has been strategizing to build support among Hispanics following the 2012 defeat, but the immigration issue has continued to alienate these voters from the GOP. In a three-way race that includes Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and his running mate, Bill Weld, 16 percent of Hispanics picked the third-party candidates, while 17 percent backed the Trump ticket. Clinton's share of the vote jumped to 59 percent, according to the poll.\n\nHispanic voters in the poll overwhelmingly sided with Clinton on immigration issues, which Trump has made a cornerstone of his campaign with get-tough policies. Clinton was deemed better suited to improve the U.S. immigration system by a 52-point margin, with 71 percent supporting her compared to 19 percent for Trump.\n\nFurthermore, Hispanic voters backed Clinton by wide margins on representing their views (72 percent to 14 percent), on education (73 percent to 19 percent), foreign policy (70 to 21 percent), health care (69 to 22 percent), and the economy (61 to 31 percent).\n\nAlfonso Aguilar, the executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, commented on the results, stating, \"The results are not that surprising given the reaction of Latinos to some of Trump's proposals.\" The poll's findings underscore the importance of the Hispanic vote in the upcoming election and the potential impact it could have on the outcome of the race.",
    " Title: An In-depth Analysis of Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All Proposal: A Comprehensive yet Costly Vision\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of the United States, Senator Bernie Sanders has unveiled a health care plan, dubbed Medicare for All, that goes beyond the traditional Medicare program. The proposal, however, has been described as \"Medicare for all and a pony,\" emphasizing its expansive nature.\n\nCurrently, Medicare is a government program that provides health care coverage for seniors and the disabled. The costs associated with Medicare are projected to increase significantly in the coming decades. Over the next 10 years, outlays are expected to grow by nearly a third as a share of the economy, and over the next 30 years, these costs are expected to double.\n\nRevenues, on the other hand, are not keeping pace. The Medicare trust fund is on track to run out of money by 2029. The question arises as to whether the country can afford Medicare as it currently exists, let alone the significant expansion proposed by Sanders.\n\nSanders' proposal aims to include the entire U.S. population in Medicare, which would increase the number of recipients sixfold in just four years. Moreover, the plan includes coverage for dental, vision, and hearing needs, which are currently excluded from Medicare. Sanders also promises \"no more copays, no more deductibles, and no more fighting with insurance companies when they fail to pay for charges.\"\n\nThe proposal, according to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, would result in a significant shift from the current Medicare system. Medicare has relatively high cost-sharing requirements for covered benefits, and unlike typical large employer plans, it does not limit beneficiaries' annual out-of-pocket spending. In 2010, the average recipient paid $2,746 for deductibles, coinsurance, and the like (not counting premiums).\n\nUnder Sanders' proposal, the government would pay all these expenses for 325 million people, not just 55 million. Moreover, the government would also pay for a significant amount of new expenses due to the removal of financial obligations, potentially leading to increased demand for health care services.\n\nThe Canadian health care system, often admired by American advocates of single-payer health insurance, provides fewer benefits than Sanders' proposal. His plan would offer more benefits to a larger population, potentially leading to higher costs.\n\nThe recent salvation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) serves as a reminder of the importance of caution and the danger of overpromising. Americans distrust ambitious changes in the realm of medical care and are wary of losing valued benefits. The failed Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare underscores the risks of overpromising and under-delivering.\n\nDemocrats, with their attraction to a single-payer health care system, face a significant challenge in balancing the appeal of universal coverage with the financial realities of such a system. Americans might love the additional benefits Sanders offers, but they may not be willing to pay for it. One notable shortcoming of Sanders' plan is that it lacks a clear price tag.\n\nAs the health insurance debate of the past 25 years has shown, good politics often leads to bad policy, and bad policy, ultimately, is bad politics. The survival of Obamacare offers Democrats an opportunity to take credit for its benefits while blaming President Donald Trump and Congress for its shortcomings. However, if they decide to embrace Medicare for all, they may win votes in the short run while inviting failure in the long run.",
    " Title: Georgia, Texas, Kentucky, and Arkansas Primaries Yield Significant Wins for Democratic Candidates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of primaries held on Tuesday, voters in Georgia, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Texas cast their ballots. President Trump won each of the four states in 2016, but Democrats are eyeing potential pickup opportunities in congressional races while making a closely watched play for the governor's mansion in Georgia.\n\nIn the marquee race of the night, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams scored a resounding primary victory, bringing her one step closer to becoming the nation's first African American woman governor if she wins in November. Her campaign is significant, not only for its historic nature, but for the way she's campaigning. She is focusing on expanding the electorate by mobilizing non-voters, including more people of color.\n\n\"We are writing the next chapter of Georgia's future where no one is unseen, no one is unheard, and no one is uninspired,\" Abrams said during a rousing speech at her post-election party.\n\nProgressives who have argued the path to victory for Democrats is engaging a new coalition of voters, rather than chasing Republican-leaning voters, say Abrams' campaign could serve as a model for future campaigns in the South.\n\nSeveral progressive groups endorsed Abrams in the primary, along with 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Clinton recorded a robo-call for her the day before the election.\n\nAbrams has an uphill battle in a red state that has never elected a woman governor. In November, she will face either Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle or Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the Republicans who advanced to a runoff primary on July 24.\n\nIn the 7th Congressional District runoff, lawyer Lizzie Pannill Fletcher's defeat of writer and organizer Laura Moser ends a chapter in a high-profile drama that divided left-wing and establishment Democrats. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC)\u2014the party's House campaign arm\u2014didn't want Moser to win. In February, the organization took the extraordinary step of releasing opposition research against Moser, infuriating liberals who endorsed her.\n\nOn Tuesday, after the results were in, Lujan released a statement saying Fletcher is \"in a very strong position for the general election.\"\n\nHouse Democrats, who need a net gain of 23 seats to win the majority, are eyeing possible pickup opportunities in this district and two others where Clinton won in 2016. Candidates included in the DCCC's \"Red to Blue\" program, which gives top-tier candidates organizational and fundraising support, won in the two other runoff primaries.\n\nThey are Gina Ortiz Jones, who served as an Air Force intelligence officer in Iraq, in the 23rd Congressional District, and civil rights attorney and former NFL linebacker Colin Allred in the 32nd Congressional District's runoff primary.\n\nAmong the winners are Ortiz Jones; former combat rescue pilot Mary Jennings \"MJ\" Hegar, a Texas Democrat; retired Navy Seal Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican; and retired Marine Lt. Col. Amy McGrath, a Kentucky Democrat.\n\n\"With these wins, we are not only one important step closer to electing four more compelling veterans to Congress, but we are also one step closer to reversing the record-high dysfunction and polarization in this country,\" said Rye Barcott, a former Marine and founder of the super PAC \"With Honor.\" The cross-partisan organization endorsed each of the candidates in its bid to increase the number of next-generation veterans in Congress.\n\nMcGrath gained a national profile last year with an introductory ad that went viral. The Naval Academy graduate and former fighter pilot described her 89 combat missions after her congressman told her when she was 13 that women shouldn't be allowed to serve in combat.\n\nIf Ortiz Jones wins in November, she will be Texas's first openly LGBTQ person of color elected to Congress, according to the Human Rights Campaign.",
    " Title: Bipartisan Bill Proposed to Strengthen Federal Background Check System and Address Mental Health in Gun Ownership\n\nArticle:\n\nA bipartisan bill aimed at strengthening the federal background check system and preventing individuals deemed mentally ill from purchasing firearms was endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) on Wednesday. The legislation, introduced by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Mark Pryor (D-AR), and Mark Begich (D-AK), seeks to clarify the circumstances under which an individual loses the right to own a firearm due to mental illness.\n\nThe bill expands the definition of those adjudicated \"mentally incompetent\" to include individuals judged to be a danger to themselves or others, those found not guilty in a criminal case by reason of insanity, and those who have undergone involuntary outpatient treatment in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nChris W. Cox, the NRA's chief lobbyist, stated, \"This bill will create accurate definitions of those who pose serious threats and should be barred from the ability to buy or possess a firearm, while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens and veterans. This legislation will significantly improve the National Instant Check System, which is critically needed.\"\n\nSenator Graham acknowledged the emotional nature of the issue, stating, \"But I am hopeful this is one area where we can find tremendous bipartisan support to fix what I think is a gaping gap in our law.\"\n\nSenator Begich emphasized that the bill creates a clear definition of mental incompetence, only applying to individuals who are committed to treatment involuntarily. It does not affect those in a mental institution for observation or those who voluntarily admit themselves to a psychiatric hospital. Individuals can also regain their right to own a firearm once they have recovered from their mental illness.\n\nThe bill's announcement precedes the Senate Judiciary Committee's consideration of four gun-related measures on Thursday, including a background check bill being negotiated by Democratic Sens. Charles E. Schumer of New York and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, as well as Republicans Mark Kirk of Illinois and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.\n\nSenator Graham expressed openness to considering the work product of the bipartisan background check negotiators, but expressed reservations about the current background check system's effectiveness. The offices of Senators Schumer and Coburn did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.",
    " Title: U.S.-Mexico Trade and Migration Talks Continue Amidst Tariff Threat\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. and Mexican officials held a second day of negotiations on trade and migration on Thursday, with markets rebounding on optimism a deal could be close, although it was unclear if Mexican pledges to curb migration flows were sufficient to persuade the Trump administration to postpone tariffs.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 5% tariffs on all Mexican exports to the United States starting on Monday if Mexico does not increase efforts to stem an increase in mostly Central American migrants heading for the U.S. border. Bilateral talks in Washington began on Wednesday to attempt to strike a deal, with the Mexican government, U.S. business groups, and even many of Trump's fellow Republicans keen to avert the tariffs, the prospect of which has rattled global financial markets.\n\nU.S. stocks, oil, and Treasury yields rose on Thursday afternoon on indications the two sides were getting closer. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said Mexico had offered \"more\" on Thursday than on Wednesday, but it would be up to Trump - who returns from a European trip on Friday - to decide if it were enough.\n\n\"There has been some movement on their part. It's been encouraging,\" he said. \"The discussions are going to continue in the days ahead.\"\n\nMexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told reporters the Mexican government had offered to send 6,000 members of the National Guard to secure its southern border with Guatemala. In a sign of a wider crackdown, the leftist administration of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said earlier that it blocked the bank accounts of 26 people for alleged links to human trafficking, while it detained on Wednesday at least 350 migrants crossing into Mexico and arrested two prominent migrant rights activists.\n\nAhead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Trump is eager to show progress on his 2016 campaign pledges to take a hard line on immigration. Apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border hit a decade high in May.\n\nBrad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, tweeted on Thursday: \"Mexico sent representatives to Washington as soon as President @realDonaldTrump announced possible tariffs. We are expected to have over 1 MILLION people arrive at our Southern Border this year. Dems are playing games with the border. The president is not!\"\n\nIf the tariffs go ahead, the United States would be in a serious trade dispute with both China and Mexico - two of its three top trading partners. Trump said on Thursday he would decide later this month whether to carry out his threat to hit Beijing with tariffs on at least $300 billion in Chinese goods.\n\nOfficials of the U.S. Federal Reserve and International Monetary Fund separately warned on Thursday that global trade tensions and rising tariffs posed an increasing risk to decades of U.S. expansion, as well as to the global economy. Analysts warn that tariffs could spark a recession in Mexico. Credit ratings agency Fitch downgraded Mexico's sovereign debt rating on Wednesday, citing trade tensions among other risks, while Moody's lowered its outlook to negative.\n\nThe White House has drafted a document for Trump that would declare a new national emergency to implement the Mexican tariffs, according to a copy of the order seen by The Hill newspaper. The head of the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee vowed to take steps to block such a move.\n\n\"If the president does declare a national emergency and attempt to put these tariffs into place, I will introduce a resolution of disapproval to stop his overreach,\" said the panel's chairman, Democrat Richard Neal.\n\nMexican officials have prepared a list of U.S. products that may face retaliatory tariffs if talks do not end in agreement. The tariffs would target U.S. products from agricultural and industrial states regarded as Trump's electoral base, a tactic China has also used with an eye toward the president's 2020 re-election bid. U.S. hog farmers fear Mexico could hit back on products like pork. Mexico bought about $1.5 billion worth of American hams and other pork products in 2017, making it the sector's top export market by volume.\n\n\"People are really scared,\" said Nick Giordano, vice president and counsel for global government affairs at the National Pork Producers Council. \"This is generating a tremendous amount of uncertainty and potentially, if this goes forward, it's going to be financial turmoil.\"",
    " Title: Tulsi Gabbard Challenges Democratic Rivals on Regime Change Wars\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a heated exchange during the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night, Tulsi Gabbard (D\u2013Hawaii) posed a question to her fellow candidates, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D\u2013Mass.) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, asking, \"Will you end the regime change wars?\"\n\nBoth candidates seemed to evade a direct answer. Warren stated that the U.S. should not maintain a military presence in the Middle East, but that any withdrawal of troops should be done slowly and carefully. Buttigieg argued that a hasty withdrawal of troops, as President Donald Trump has currently ordered, would amount to a betrayal of the Kurdish allies, and thus, a broken promise by the U.S.\n\nGabbard, however, suggested that the best way to protect the Kurds would be to allow them to immigrate to the U.S., rather than commit the U.S. to an endless war on their behalf.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden later criticized Gabbard, stating that the U.S.'s involvement abroad was not solely for the defense of the Kurds, but to tie terrorists down and prevent them from causing harm to Americans at home. Biden's remarks were less persuasive, given his initial confusion of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nGabbard was the only candidate on the stage Tuesday night to advocate for a unilateral, immediate end to the U.S.'s interventionist policy in the Middle East, with the goal of regime change. She pointed out that such policies have led to disastrous consequences in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and potentially Syria.\n\nRefreshingly, Gabbard called out both parties and the mainstream media for their complicity in the U.S.'s foreign policy interventionism. \"Just two days ago, The New York Times called me an Assad apologist, a Russian asset,\" Gabbard said. \"Completely despicable.\"\n\nAs Christian Britschgi of the Libertarian magazine Reason noted earlier this week, the Times' attack on Gabbard was based on \"a mix of thin evidence, guilt by association, and conspiratorial framing of actions that any single-issue-focused dark horse candidate is liable to do.\"\n\nGabbard, a progressive Democrat with liberal domestic policies, is nearly alone among the Democratic candidates in advocating for a realistic foreign policy on the issue of regime change. Her stance on this issue, which has given the executive branch nearly unlimited power due to Congress's refusal to check any president's military ambitions, stands out as a pragmatic and unconventional approach to the U.S.'s approach to the Middle East since the turn of the century.",
    " Title: Justice Department Investigates Possible Russian Disinformation to Clinton Campaign During 2016 Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, Attorney General William P. Barr has revealed that the Justice Department is examining the possibility that Russian operatives may have fed disinformation to the Hillary Clinton campaign during the 2016 presidential election. This expanded investigation focuses on the activities of the summer of 2016, which included key decisions made by vehemently anti-Trump FBI senior officials during the investigations of both Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nOne crucial aspect under scrutiny is the extent to which the FBI relied on the dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, which contained information sourced from Russian entities. This dossier, funded by payments from the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee disguised in campaign finance reports under payments to a law firm, is believed to have contributed to the Trump-Russia collusion narrative.\n\nRepublican senators have suggested that Steele's Russian sources may have intentionally fed him disinformation, which then reached the highest levels of the FBI. Notably, former FBI Director James B. Comey's first personal interaction with Trump was to brief him on the Steele dossier shortly before his inauguration in January 2017.\n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chamber's senior Republican, commented, \"That's the definition of collusion.\"\n\nAttorney General Barr acknowledged the concern and stated, \"That is one of the areas that I'm reviewing. I'm concerned about it, and I don't think it's entirely speculative.\"\n\nDemocrats expressed dismay at the prospect of a counterinvestigation, arguing that the focus should remain on Trump and his team's alleged efforts to coordinate with Russia in 2016 and any subsequent obstruction of the resulting investigation. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Kremlin ran a major disinformation campaign in 2016 to hurt Clinton and boost Trump in the race.\n\nSen. Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, referred to the Republican efforts as \"the so-called lock-her-up defense,\" a reference to a popular Trump campaign trail chant against Clinton for her use of a secret unsecured email account while serving as secretary of state under President Barack Obama.\n\nMr. Durbin stated, \"That's old news. That is totally unresponsive to the reality of what the American people want to know.\"\n\nAttorney General Barr was on Capitol Hill to testify about his handling of special counsel Robert Mueller's final report on the Russian hacking operation, submitted to the Justice Department in late March and revealed to the public in lightly redacted form two weeks ago.\n\nMueller concluded that despite their shared interest in defeating Clinton, there was no evidence that Trump or his aides coordinated efforts with Moscow in the election. Mueller stated there was evidence that Trump tried to hinder investigations into Russia and his presidential campaign, but he didn't reach any firm conclusions on criminality. Barr, however, did reach conclusions, stating it would have been impossible to make a prosecutable case.\n\nThis, ironically, is the same conclusion Comey came to in 2016 when he exonerated Clinton for her emails. It was later revealed that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump campaign figures several weeks afterward, though the agency never informed Trump or his team.\n\nBarr described the zealous pursuit of Trump as the work of a few high-placed officials who engaged in \"overreach\" \u2014 and who have since been ousted from their jobs.\n\n\"It was a few people in the upper echelons of the bureau and perhaps the department. But those people are no longer there,\" he said.\n\nBarr previously revealed that he was looking into FBI and Justice Department decisions surrounding the 2016 campaign. Congressional Republicans have long pressed the theory that the FBI investigation began illegitimately, fueled by agents who were intent on discrediting the Republican nominee.\n\nBarr stated he will piggyback on the work of the inspector general and investigations completed by congressional committees and Mueller. These promises are likely to thrill Trump, who has long maintained that any criminal behavior during the campaign is connected to Clinton.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee made payments \u2014 hidden in campaign finance documents behind a law firm \u2014 to Fusion GPS, a Democratic research operation that paid Steele to investigate reports of Trump's financial links to Russia. Steele produced the dossier that claimed secret meetings between Trump campaign figures and Russian operatives and suggested salacious events such as blackmail-style tapes of a Trump encounter with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room. The Mueller report found no evidence to corroborate either of the allegations.\n\nBarr stated he will review how and when the FBI learned of the Democratic backing for the Steele dossier. The attorney general also suggested that Trump should have been briefed on Russian meddling in the election, including efforts to reach out to his campaign.\n\n\"I can't fathom why it did not happen,\" he said. \"If you are concerned about interference in the election and you have substantial people involved in the campaign who are former U.S. attorneys, you had three former U.S. attorneys there in the campaign. I don't know why the bureau would not have gone and given a defensive briefing.\"\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican, asked whether Barr would support a change to legislation mandating that presidential nominees be given those kinds of briefings as a matter of course, given foreign governments' interests in subverting U.S. elections.\n\n\"The danger from countries like China, Russia, and so forth is far more insidious than it has been in the past because of nontraditional collectors that they have operating in the United States, and I think most people are unaware of how pervasive it is and what the risk level is,\" he said. \"I think it actually should go far beyond even campaigns where people involved in government have to be educated on this.\"",
    " Title: President Obama to Address 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington, Discussing Progress and Challenges in Civil Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the symbolic footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr. and Abraham Lincoln, President Barack Obama will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington on Wednesday. The event will serve as a platform for the President to celebrate the advancements made in civil rights, while acknowledging the work that still needs to be done to achieve racial justice in America.\n\nAccording to White House aides, Obama will discuss the need to protect voting rights and create opportunities for economically disadvantaged individuals, regardless of race. The President's remarks will emphasize the progress made since the civil rights movement, while acknowledging that discrimination still persists, albeit in a less overt form than it was 50 years ago.\n\nObama's comments on race are not a frequent topic in his public discourse, but he has written and thought extensively about the issue. During a college visit in New York last week, an African-American professor asked the President where he believed the country stood in terms of civil rights. Obama's response was nuanced, acknowledging significant progress while also highlighting the remaining barriers to success.\n\n\"Obviously, we've made enormous strides,\" said Obama. \"I'm a testament to it. You're a testament to it.\" However, he also noted that discrimination has not vanished and that the legacy of Jim Crow has left lasting barriers to success, particularly for those living in impoverished neighborhoods with underfunded schools.\n\nFollowing the Trayvon Martin verdict last month, Obama spoke candidly about his experiences with racial profiling as a black man in America. His remarks were praised by some but criticized by others. Abigail Thernstrom, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights appointed by President George W. Bush, expressed her disapproval, stating, \"I do not think that the racial climate in this country is helped when the president wades into what are always turbulent racial waters and stirs things up, which is what he did.\"\n\nHowever, Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher disagreed, arguing that open discussions about race are necessary for progress. \"It's a conversation that makes a lot of white America uncomfortable and they would rather not have,\" said Belcher. \"And understand, they have not had to have the conversation.\"\n\nIn addition to addressing racial issues, Obama has not shied away from discussing problems within the African-American community, particularly the high rates of poor decision-making among young men. In May, he spoke to graduates of Morehouse College, urging them to reject excuses and remember the hardships overcome by previous generations.\n\nOn Wednesday, Obama is expected to discuss civil rights in a broader context, encompassing not just blacks and whites but also Latinos, women, and the LGBTQ+ community. He is likely to emphasize the interconnectedness of all civil rights movements, as he did in his second inaugural address when he spoke of Selma, Stonewall, and Seneca Falls\u2014the touchstone battlegrounds for these movements.\n\nObama has often quoted King's comment that all of us are \"tied in a single garment of destiny.\" However, he has also warned in recent weeks that economic anxiety could lead to the unraveling of this unifying fabric. \"Because times have been tough, because wages and incomes for everybody have not been going up, everybody is pretty anxious about what's happening in their lives and what might happen for their kids,\" Obama said.\n\nIn his remarks on Wednesday, the President is expected to challenge his audience to renew the promise of civil rights, particularly in terms of lifting up poor communities and helping young people succeed, as a means of fulfilling the \"promissory note\" King spoke of 50 years ago.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds North Dakota Voter ID Requirement for 2018 Elections, Sparks Dissent from Justice Ginsburg\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a decision on Tuesday, the Supreme Court declined to overturn a lower court's ruling that allows North Dakota to enforce its voter identification requirement during the 2018 elections. The decision has sparked a dissenting opinion from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nThe case stems from a group of Native American residents challenging a new state law that requires voters to present identification that includes a current residential street address. The challengers argue that the new rule disenfranchises a disproportionate share of the population because many Native American voters live on reservations without standard addresses.\n\nThe District Court initially agreed and temporarily blocked the North Dakota secretary of state from enforcing the new requirements during the primary elections. However, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that court order last month.\n\nThe challengers asked the Supreme Court in an urgent request to toss out the 8th Circuit's stay, arguing it has left thousands of Native American voters unable to cast ballots. The court, however, denied the request without explanation.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, who recently joined the court, did not take part in the decision. Justice Ginsburg, on the other hand, filed a dissenting opinion, which Justice Elena Kagan joined.\n\nGinsburg argued that last-minute court orders affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can result in voter confusion and keep people from turning out to the polls.\n\n\"The risk of voter confusion appears severe here because the injunction against requiring residential-address identification was in force during the primary election and because the Secretary of State\u2019s website announced for months the ID requirements as they existed under that injunction,\" Ginsburg said.\n\n\"Reasonable voters may well assume that the IDs allowing them to vote in the primary election would remain valid in the general election,\" she added.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to uphold the voter ID requirement in North Dakota's 2018 elections has sparked debate and concern among civil rights groups and Native American communities. The case is expected to have implications for other states with similar voter ID laws.",
    " Title: Wall Street Economists Remain Cautious Despite Improving Economy Amidst Government Dysfunction\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States economy is showing signs of improvement, with a falling unemployment rate, rising house prices, a soaring stock market, and overall economic growth exceeding expectations. However, despite these positive indicators, Wall Street economists remain cautious, citing government dysfunction as the leading risk factor.\n\nRecent reports suggest an economy picking up speed as the jobless rate drops to 7%, a gain of 203,000 jobs in November, and a significant decrease in furloughed workers following the government shutdown. This improvement, however, may not be as robust as it appears, with potential risks such as poorly designed spending cuts, ongoing Obamacare debates, and the Federal Reserve's stimulus tapering posing threats to the economy.\n\nWhile a fresh round of fiscal brinksmanship leading to a shutdown or debt limit scare in 2014 seems unlikely, it cannot be ruled out. Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, notes that the economy's improvement is due to decreasing headwinds from Washington, but warns that Washington remains a risk.\n\nThe current run of good economic data, including a 3.6% GDP growth rate, is largely attributed to the economy's resilience despite Washington's dismal state. However, the shutdown's impact may be felt in the fourth quarter, with the Obama administration predicting a 0.25 percentage point decrease in GDP growth due to the 16-day shutdown that furloughed 850,000 workers.\n\nWhile the November jobs report shows a significant increase in employment, there is still skepticism about the strength of the economy's recovery. Catherine L. Mann, professor of economics at Brandeis University, questions the assumption of significantly stronger growth and faster job creation in 2014, citing weak consumption, business investment, and export trends.\n\nOne hope for 2014 is a deal between House Budget Committee Chair Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray to reduce the immediate impact of the 2014 sequester spending cuts on the economy. Reports suggest they are close to an agreement, with only a few billion dollars in budgetary savings remaining. Their deadline is next Friday.\n\nIn conclusion, while the economy is showing signs of improvement, Wall Street economists remain cautious due to ongoing government dysfunction. The potential risks, such as poorly designed spending cuts, Obamacare debates, and the Federal Reserve's stimulus tapering, could negatively impact the economy in 2014. The success of congressional negotiations between Ryan and Murray in reducing the impact of the 2014 sequester spending cuts could play a significant role in the economy's recovery.",
    " Title: Trump Threatens Legal Action Against Pelosi and Schiff Amidst Impeachment Inquiry\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a fiery speech at the Values Voter Summit in Washington D.C., President Donald Trump expressed his disapproval of the ongoing impeachment inquiry led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), stating that his administration is considering legal action against both politicians.\n\n\"We're going to take a look at it. We're going after these people. These are bad, bad people,\" Trump said, referring to Pelosi and Schiff. \"I actually told my lawyer, I said sue [Schiff] anyway. I said, even if we lose, the American public will understand.\"\n\nTrump's comments come amidst a wave of revelations regarding his efforts to encourage Ukraine to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, which led Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry last month. The inquiry centers around a whistleblower complaint filed within the intelligence community and focuses on the president's interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump is accused of carrying out a broad effort to pressure Zelensky to find dirt on the Biden family. A White House memorandum of the leaders' July 25 phone call confirms that Trump asked Zelensky to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr on the probe.\n\nMultiple House committees, including the one led by Schiff, have called for documents and depositions from numerous Trump administration officials as part of the inquiry. However, the White House has vowed not to cooperate.\n\nTrump has repeatedly decried the impeachment inquiry, often referring to it as a \"coup\" and a \"witch hunt.\" During a campaign rally on Friday, he suggested that the impeachment inquiry showed Pelosi \"hates the United States of America.\"\n\nPelosi's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's latest remarks. The U.S. Constitution stipulates that members of Congress cannot be impeached.",
    " Title: White House Pushes for Comprehensive Gun Violence Plan as Biden Meets with Various Groups\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Obama administration is actively seeking ideas for a comprehensive plan to address gun violence, with Vice President Joe Biden's task force reportedly focusing on a range of gun control measures. This week, Biden is set to meet with gun safety organizations, gun violence victims' groups, gun ownership groups, sportsmen, representatives from the entertainment and video game industries, and the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\nThe administration aims to produce a comprehensive plan by the end of the month, following the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting massacre that left 26 dead. In addition to gun control measures, the administration is also considering examining mental health and the entertainment industry.\n\nWhile much of the discussion centers around gun control, the White House has vowed to \"close the many loopholes in our background check system\" and \"support congressional actions right away.\" Proposals under consideration include universal background checks for gun buyers, a national gun database, strengthening mental-health checks, and tougher penalties for people carrying guns near schools or giving them to minors.\n\nThe NRA, among other gun rights groups, has expressed concern over the accelerated efforts to draft new gun control measures. In response to these concerns, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) stated that the next round of fiscal deadlines will occupy Congress's attention, pushing off the consideration of gun legislation for at least three months.\n\nHowever, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated that the president still plans to act quickly on Biden's proposals, expressing concern that the shock of the Newtown shooting may fade, and with it, the prospects for pro-gun lawmakers to work with the White House to tighten restrictions.\n\nBiden's recommendations are expected to include both legislative proposals and executive actions that Obama can sign into law without congressional approval. The president has already called on Congress to reinstate a ban on military-style assault weapons, close loopholes that allow gun buyers to skirt background checks, and restrict high-capacity magazines.\n\nIn addition to Biden's meetings this week, Education Secretary Arne Duncan will meet with parent and teacher groups, while Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will meet with mental health and disability advocates. The White House has also scheduled meetings with community organizations, business owners, and religious leaders.",
    " Title: Former Defense Secretary Mattis Breaks Silence, Criticizes Trump's Response to George Floyd Protests\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a scathing statement released over the weekend, former Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly condemned President Donald Trump's response to the police killing of George Floyd and the subsequent protests, marking a significant departure from his previous stance of silence regarding his criticisms of the current administration.\n\nMattis, who served as defense secretary from 2017 to 2018, contrasted the American ethos of unity with Nazi ideology in his statement. He referenced the military departments' instructions before the Normandy invasion, stating, \"The Nazi slogan for destroying us \u2026 was \u2018Divide and Conquer.\u2019 Our American answer is \u2018In Union there is Strength.\u2019\"\n\nMattis's dissatisfaction with Trump was not a secret within the Pentagon during his tenure. However, after his resignation, he argued against publicly criticizing a sitting president, citing the importance of maintaining the apolitical nature of the military. In an interview last year, he stated, \"When you leave an administration over clear policy differences, you need to give the people who are still there as much opportunity as possible to defend the country. They still have the responsibility of protecting this great big experiment of ours.\"\n\nHowever, Mattis now believes that the American experiment is directly threatened by the actions of the president he once served. In his statement, he made it clear that the president's response to the George Floyd protests was the catalyst for his public condemnation.\n\n\"When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution,\" Mattis wrote. \"Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens\u2014much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside.\"\n\nMattis also implicitly criticized the current secretary of defense, Mark Esper, and other senior officials in his statement. He emphasized the importance of maintaining a clear distinction between the military and civilian society, stating, \"Keeping public order rests with civilian state and local leaders who best understand their communities and are answerable to them.\"\n\nThis public condemnation from a former defense secretary marks a significant moment in the ongoing debate surrounding the Trump administration's handling of the George Floyd protests and the broader issue of racial inequality in America.",
    " Title: \"Assessing the Impact of Higher Education: A Call for Reflection on College Graduates' Character and Values\"\n\nArticle:\n\nWhen evaluating the merits of attending a university, a crucial question to consider is: What type of person does the institution produce? This question, regardless of political affiliations, is one that parents across the spectrum can agree on. While they may disagree on the desired outcome, all parents would concur that the question, \"What type of person did college produce?\" is significant.\n\nIn the opinion of Dennis Prager, a nationally syndicated radio talk-show host and columnist, colleges today often produce individuals who are no better, wiser, or more mature than when they graduated high school. Prager's concerns revolve around the prevalence of college drinking, sexual activity, depression, and mental illness among students.\n\nAccording to Alcohol Rehab Guide, a large percentage of college students engage in binge drinking, with men consuming five or more alcoholic beverages in two hours, and women consuming four or more drinks within the same timeframe. Furthermore, it is estimated that 50% of these students engage in binge drinking.\n\nThe impact of college drinking is not limited to alcohol-related issues. The increased sexual activity that often results from college drinking can lead to regrettable encounters, particularly for women.\n\nIn addition to these concerns, there is a growing mental health crisis among college students, as clinical psychologist Gregg Henriques notes in Psychology Today. Henriques states that America's college students are experiencing higher levels of stress and psychopathology than at any other time in the nation's history.\n\nParents should reflect on whether their child, upon returning from college, has become more respectful, grateful, open-minded, or mature. Prager suggests that the answers to these questions are crucial in determining whether sending a child to college is a worthwhile investment.\n\nPrager acknowledges that students pursuing STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields must attend college. However, for most other students, attending college is a gamble with their values, character, and even their joy of life.\n\nIn conclusion, parents should carefully consider the type of person a university produces before making the decision to send their child there. It is essential to weigh the potential risks associated with college drinking, depression, and mental illness against the benefits of a college education. Parents should engage in open discussions with college students, recent graduates, and their families to make an informed decision.",
    " Title: U.S.-Taliban Negotiations: A Look at the Controversy and Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent cancellation of planned negotiations between the United States and the Taliban has sparked criticism from the political left, who are skeptical of any deal with the Taliban and critical of President Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts. The controversy revolves around the timing of the proposed talks, which were set to take place just days before the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, orchestrated by the Taliban's ally, Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe left argues that Trump's decision to host Taliban leaders under such circumstances is questionable, and they point to his past criticisms of President Barack Obama for negotiating with the Taliban. The cancellation of the talks, they claim, is a result of the Taliban's continued violence, a claim that the Trump administration denies.\n\nThe Afghanistan conflict has been a point of contention for Trump, who has promised to end U.S. involvement in the region. However, the negotiations seem to be a delicate balancing act, as the Taliban demands a complete U.S. withdrawal, while the administration aims to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a \"Harvard for terrorists.\"\n\nThe Taliban has consistently refused to negotiate directly with the Afghan government, despite the significant impact their talks with the U.S. will have on the Afghan people and their government. The cancelled Camp David talks were intended to bring Taliban leaders and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani together, potentially strengthening Ghani's position ahead of his reelection at the end of this month.\n\nThe failure of Trump's dealmaking efforts extends beyond Afghanistan. His promises to secure a new nuclear deal with Iran, to make progress in talks with North Korea, and to renegotiate trade deals have largely gone unfulfilled. The cancellation of the Camp David talks adds to this growing list of unmet promises.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the U.S.-Taliban negotiations has led to questions about the legitimacy of the dealings and their potential impact on Afghanistan. The outcome of these negotiations will significantly affect the Afghan people and their government, making it crucial that any agreement includes the Afghan government in the negotiations.\n\nThe cancellation of the Camp David talks has left many questioning the Trump administration's dealmaking abilities, particularly in light of his 2016 campaign promises. As the 2020 election approaches, the success or failure of these negotiations will likely be a significant factor in voters' decisions.",
    " Title: Trump's Legal Team Reveals Potential Questions from Mueller, Tensions Escalate over Russia Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets Wednesday morning, President Donald Trump denounced the ongoing Russia investigation as a \"setup & trap,\" asserting that there is \"no Collusion\" and \"no Obstruction of Justice.\" The president's comments come after it was reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller suggested to Trump's legal team that he could subpoena the president to appear before a grand jury if he refuses an interview with investigators.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, John Dowd, Trump's former lead attorney, confirmed Tuesday night that Mueller raised the possibility of a subpoena during a meeting with Trump's legal team in March. Dowd, who resigned as Trump's lead lawyer weeks later amid a dispute over how to answer Mueller's request for a presidential interview, reportedly told investigators, \"This isn't some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.\"\n\nThe suggestion that Mueller could try to compel an appearance by the president escalates tensions over the investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials ahead of the 2016 election. The escalation comes a day after Fox News, The New York Times, and other outlets obtained a list of questions that Trump's legal team believes Mueller wishes to ask him.\n\nThe possible questions cover Trump's interactions with key figures in the Russia saga, including former FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn. The queries also touch on Trump's businesses and his discussions with his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, about a possible Moscow real estate deal. Cohen's business dealings are part of a separate FBI investigation.\n\nOne question asks what discussions Trump may have had regarding \"any meeting with Mr. Putin,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Another question asks what the president may have known about a possible attempt by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to set up a back channel with Russia before Trump's inauguration.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Trump said it was \"disgraceful\" that the list of potential questions had been leaked to the media. In a brief phone conversation with Fox News, Dowd denied that he had leaked the list to the media and denied that he was the source of the initial Washington Post report on the Mueller meeting. The White House has not yet responded to requests for comment.",
    " Title: Obama Administration Awards Navigator Grant to Registered Lobbying Firm for Obamacare Enrollment\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that contrasts with President Obama's campaign pledge to exclude lobbyists from his administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) last month awarded a half-million-dollar grant to a registered lobbying firm, Chatman LLC, to help enroll people for Obamacare as Affordable Care Act navigators.\n\nThe grant, totaling $510,577, was given to Chatman LLC, which has disclosed its lobbying activities on behalf of a private hospital client and the health care law itself. The firm was awarded the grant to provide navigator services in Delaware.\n\nCraig Holman, legislative representative for the watchdog group Public Citizen, commented that it is unusual for a lobbying firm to secure a government contract, but the company may have won the grant due to its grass-roots outreach capabilities.\n\nThe award comes amidst President Obama's campaign promises to rein in the influence of lobbyists in Washington. In January, Priscilla Chatman, the firm's principal, was denied entry to an Obama inauguration party after organizers discovered she was a registered lobbyist. However, this did not prevent her firm from securing work under the CMS navigator program.\n\nMore than 100 organizations received grants from CMS last month to help the public apply for Obamacare coverage. Although most of the organizations winning those grants were nonprofit and educational, Chatman LLC appears to be the only entity that is a registered lobbying firm, according to a review by The \u2588\u2588\u2588.\n\nMr. Holman suggested additional restrictions on Chatman LLC, including clear segregation between lines of business and ensuring that no grant money can be used toward lobbying. He stated, \"These are a few of the reasons why lobbying firms tend to shy away from government contracts.\"\n\nNavigators, including Chatman LLC, are barred from lobbying on behalf of the health insurance industry and must adhere to strict conflict-of-interest standards, according to CMS spokeswoman Rachel Maisler. She emphasized the importance of navigators in helping Americans learn about their health insurance options, enroll in the Marketplace, and find the plan that is best for themselves and their families.\n\nCMS stated that grants were awarded competitively and that Chatman LLC was in compliance with all conflict-of-interest rules. Chatman LLC did not respond directly to questions from The Times about whether its lobbying work surfaced during the grant application process. Instead, the firm released a statement highlighting its relevant experience in the health care sector.\n\nAccording to the firm's lobbying disclosure forms, Ms. Chatman works for the Livingston Group\u2014another lobbying firm\u2014on behalf of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. CMS was the only federal agency that the firm lobbied during the most recent quarter, along with the Senate and House. During the summer, the firm filed a separate disclosure form showing it had lobbied, among other issues, on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRecent weeks have seen scrutiny of several recipients of the navigator grants. The New York Post reported that Seedco, a community development group that won contract work to enroll people for Obamacare, had been sued by the federal government on claims of fraud. Seedco told the paper that it had made important changes, including installing new management.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have raised questions about the vetting process for organizations and navigator personnel. Sen.

    " Title: The Debate on Free Speech and Social Media: A Closer Look at YouTube's Decision to Terminate Steven Crowder and the Implications for Free Market Advocates\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, YouTube, a privately-owned media platform, has decided to terminate the account of American conservative commentator Steven Crowder for violating the rules of their Partner Program. This decision has sparked a debate among free market advocates, with some questioning whether they should support the company's right to remove content that Silicon Valley finds triggering, even if a disproportionate number of such removals are made by conservative commentators.\n\nThis article aims to explore the nuances of this issue, drawing parallels with the electricity industry to illustrate the complexities involved.\n\nThe argument posits that if a private enterprise, such as an electric company, were to restrict service based on political beliefs, free market advocates would likely object. However, in the case of social media giants like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, the argument shifts.\n\nThe electricity industry, like social media, is characterized by \"bigger is better\" economics, where size confers advantage. Disconnecting a few customers would be costly for a competing power company, and the former customers would likely go unpowered. In contrast, being excluded from popular social media platforms could impose a significant cost on users due to network externalities, where the value of the platform is proportional to the number of customers on it.\n\nThe U.S. government requires electric utilities to provide power to everyone in their service area willing to pay the standard price. Similarly, it is argued, the government should prohibit big tech social media from engaging in viewpoint discrimination.\n\nHowever, the comparison between electricity and social media is not without its differences. While food is more essential than power, social media is crucial for many in contributing to the national political debate. Anonymity protects consumers from offending big businesses, but social media companies can effectively stop users from accessing their platforms by banning accounts.\n\nCritics argue that social media companies need to remove disruptive customers who degrade other users' experiences. However, users can block other accounts, and big tech could make it easy for their customers to subscribe to block lists created by others.\n\nEconomic blogger Tyler Cowen suggests that despite social media deplatforming, information technology has given us far more publishing options than in the 1990s. Right-of-center commentators may currently be better situated than in recent history. However, if social media companies fully supported a future president, they could, under current laws, cancel the accounts of anyone who too effectively criticized him.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate on free speech and social media is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. As we move forward, it is crucial to ensure that the principles of free speech and the free market are balanced, and that the power dynamics of these platforms do not stifle diverse perspectives.",
    " Title: U.S. Intelligence Community Warned of Coronavirus Threat Ahead of White House Response, Reports Indicate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community had been warning of the potential danger posed by the novel coronavirus as early as January and February, while the White House downplayed the threat and was slow to implement nationwide measures, according to reports from The Washington Post.\n\nU.S. officials familiar with spy agency reporting revealed that these reports did not specify when the virus might spread in the U.S. or recommend specific steps to prevent an outbreak. However, they did track the international spread of the coronavirus and warned that China was initially dismissing the seriousness of what is now a pandemic.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, through his spokesperson Hogan Gidley, did take early action to close the border to any travelers from China, where the coronavirus first appeared. However, the White House was slow to make test kits available and largely ceded the response to state governments.\n\nA U.S. official who had access to intelligence reporting told the Post, \"Intelligence agencies have been warning on this since January. Donald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were \u2014 they just couldn't get him to do anything about it.\"\n\nThe White House has defended the president's response, dismissing claims that the administration was caught flat-footed and insisting that Trump took early and significant action. In a statement to the Post, Gidley said, \"President Trump has taken historic, aggressive measures to protect the health, wealth and safety of the American people \u2014 and did so while the media and Democrats chose to only focus on the stupid politics of a sham illegitimate impeachment. It's more than disgusting, despicable and disgraceful for cowardly unnamed sources to attempt to rewrite history \u2014 it's a clear threat to this great country.\"",
    " Title: President Trump Defends Syria Withdrawal, Affirms No Plans to Withdraw from Iraq During Surprise Visit\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected trip to Iraq, President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria, where they have been aiding the battle against Islamic State militants.\n\n\"We're no longer the suckers, folks,\" Trump told American servicemen and women at a base in western Iraq. \"We're respected again as a nation.\"\n\nTrump said it was due to U.S. military gains that he could withdraw 2,000 forces from Syria. During his first visit to a troubled region, Trump also said he has no plans to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq.\n\n\"I made it clear from the beginning that our mission in Syria was to strip ISIS of its military strongholds,\" Trump told troops clad in fatigues at al-Asad Airbase west of Baghdad.\n\n\"Eight years ago, we went there for three months and we never left,\" he said. \"Now, we're doing it right and we're going to finish it off.\"\n\nHe said that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has agreed to take out \"any remnants\" of IS left in Syria. The U.S. presence in Syria was not meant to be \"open-ended,\" he said, adding that other wealthy nations should pay for rebuilding Syria.\n\n\"The nations of the region must step up and take more responsibility for their future,\" said Trump, who said there would be a \"strong, deliberate and orderly withdrawal\" of U.S. forces from Syria.\n\nTrump's trip to Iraq came a week after he stunned his national security advisers by announcing the U.S. troop withdrawal from Syria. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis abruptly resigned following the announcement, and Trump's decision rattled allies around the world, including in Iraq.\n\nTrump's trip was shrouded in secrecy. Air Force One flew overnight from Washington, landing at an airbase west of Baghdad under the cover of darkness Wednesday evening. It is his first visit with troops stationed in a troubled region.\n\nFifteen years after the 2003 invasion, the U.S. still has more than 5,000 troops in Iraq supporting the government as it continues the fight against remaining pockets of resistance by the Islamic State group. IS has lost a significant amount of territory in Iraq and Syria but is still seen as a threat.\n\nTrump, who speaks often about his support for the U.S. military, had faced criticism for not yet visiting U.S. troops stationed in harm's way as he comes up on his two-year mark in office. He told The Associated Press in an October interview that he \"will do that at some point, but I do not think it's overly necessary.\" He later began to signal that such a troop visit was in the offing.\n\nTrump had planned to spend Christmas at his private club in Florida, but stayed behind in Washington due to the shutdown. It's unclear whether his trip to Iraq was added after it became apparent that the government would be shut down indefinitely due to a stalemate between Trump and congressional Democrats over the president's demand for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAdding to the tumult, the stock market has been experiencing heavy losses over concerns about a slowing global economy, Trump's trade war with China, and the president's public slamming of the Federal Reserve and its chairman over interest rate hikes by the independent agency.\n\nTrump's visit comes at a time when his Middle East policy is in flux. He went against the views of his top national security advisers in announcing the Syria withdrawal, a decision that risks creating a vacuum for extremists to thrive. There are dire implications in particular for neighboring Iraq. The Iraqi government now has control of all the country's cities, towns, and villages after fighting its last urban battles against IS in December 2017. However, its political, military, and economic situation remains uncertain, and the country continues to experience sporadic bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations, which most people attribute to IS.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi recently said Iraqi troops could deploy into Syria to protect Iraq from threats across its borders. Iraq keeps reinforcements along its frontier to guard against infiltration by IS militants, who hold a pocket of territory along the Euphrates River.\n\nTrump campaigned for office on a platform of ending U.S. involvement in foreign trouble spots, such as Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The Syria decision will ultimately affect all of the approximately 2,000 troops deployed in the war-torn country. The Pentagon is also said to be developing plans to withdraw up to half of the 14,000 American troops still serving in Afghanistan.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump blamed Democrat Hillary Clinton for the rise of IS, due to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011 during her tenure as secretary of state. President George W. Bush is the one who set the 2011 withdrawal date as part of an agreement with the Iraqi government to gradually shrink the U.S. footprint and slowly hand off security responsibilities to the government and Iraqi security forces.\n\nHis successor, President Barack Obama, wanted to leave a residual force in Iraq to help the government manage ongoing security challenges. But he ultimately went ahead with the scheduled pullout in 2011 after Iraqi's political leaders rejected terms the U.S. sought for legal protections for the U.S. troops that would have remained.\n\nTwo of Trump's recent predecessors visited Iraq early in their terms. Bush visited Iraq in November 2003, about eight months after that conflict began. Due to security concerns, Bush waited until 2006 to make his first visit to Afghanistan. Obama visited Iraq in April 2009, the first year of his eight years in office, as part of an overseas tour. He visited Afghanistan in 2010. Vice President Mike Pence visited Afghanistan in December 2017, not long after Trump outlined a strategy to break the stalemate in America's longest war. Pence met with Afghan leaders and visited with U.S. troops stationed in the country. Trump has not visited Afghanistan.",
    " Title: Nurses Speak Out Against Police Violence and Tear Gas Use on Protesters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Sacramento, California, registered nurse Asantewaa Boykin found herself in the midst of chaos during a recent protest in Cesar Chavez plaza. The peaceful demonstration was disrupted when protesters were met with tear gas from the Sacramento police. Boykin, a social justice advocate and a registered nurse at Sacramento's UC Davis Medical Center, was among those affected by the tear gas.\n\nBoykin, a member of National Nurses United (NNU), has witnessed the brutal consequences of police violence during protests. She has seen injuries ranging from skull fractures to abrasions, and the use of tear gas, flashbangs, rubber bullets, and other forms of police violence.\n\nTear gas, a chemical weapon banned in warfare, has been used liberally by police departments across the country on protesters. It can cause symptoms including vomiting, blurred vision, shortness of breath, tearing, difficulty swallowing, temporary blindness, pain, coughing, and sneezing. During a pandemic, the use of tear gas is particularly concerning, as it can spread the virus causing COVID-19.\n\nIn addition to tear gas, militarized police have used flashbangs, which can cause burns, hearing loss, temporary blindness, injuries from shrapnel, and death. Rubber bullets, often with a metal core, have been responsible for deaths, organ damage, internal bleeding, and bruising.\n\nNurses, as advocates for public health and safety, are calling for an end to this violence. Heather Honstein, RN, a cardiovascular surgical ICU nurse at Washington D.C.'s MedStar Washington Hospital, joined the protests peacefully in Lafayette square near the White House on June 1. Honstein, an NNU member, left before federal police violently dispersed the crowd, using gas canisters, grenades, and significant force.\n\nBonnie Castillo, RN, the executive director of National Nurses United, emphasizes that the only people who come to protests dressed for war are police officers. The use of force against protesters exercising their constitutional right to assembly is a threat to democracy and a colossal waste of public resources.\n\nAs nurses, we are on the front lines of a pandemic at work, and now, on the front lines of a local battlefield in our free time. The use of violence and so-called \"less lethal\" weapons of force is not the solution to keeping our patients safe. Standing up for racial justice and the issues that matter should not be lethal in any amount.",
    " Title: U.S. and China Agree on 90-Day Trade War Ceasefire, Expectations for Immediate Action on Tariffs and Intellectual Property\n\nThe United States and China have agreed to a 90-day ceasefire in their ongoing trade war, with the expectation that China will take immediate action to cut tariffs on U.S. car imports and end intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers as the two countries move toward a broader trade deal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to the ceasefire during their meeting in Argentina on Saturday. The two leaders have agreed to hold off on imposing more tariffs for 90 days starting December 1 while they negotiate a deal to end the dispute.\n\nDuring the meeting, China offered more than $1.2 trillion in additional commitments on trade, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. However, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow stated that the figure was a broad benchmark that would depend on private transactions for U.S. goods and was subject to market conditions.\n\nChina has committed to start lifting tariffs and non-tariff barriers immediately, including reducing its 40 percent tariffs on autos, according to Kudlow. \"We expect those tariffs to fall to zero,\" he told reporters. Americans would also get a majority ownership in Chinese companies for the first time, Kudlow said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a working dinner after the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina on December 1, 2018. (Photo by Kevin Lamarque)\n\nAdministration officials expressed a mixture of skepticism and optimism on Monday over whether China would deliver on its commitments. None of the commitments were agreed to in writing, and many specifics have yet to be worked out. Kudlow said U.S. officials would monitor Chinese progress closely.\n\nNegotiators will actually have less than 90 days to reach a deal because of holidays in both countries over the next three months, Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, told reporters on Monday.\n\nTrump has appointed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who just completed a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico and is one of the administration's most vocal China critics, to oversee the new round of talks. The appointment may signify a harder line with Beijing and marks a shift from the past, when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin had a lead role.\n\nThe White House is stepping up efforts to prod other countries to build more vehicles in the United States. Lighthizer and other officials, including Kudlow, are set to meet with German automakers, including the chief executives of Volkswagen AG and Daimler AG, on Tuesday. Kudlow said the meeting was not meant to focus on potential tariffs, though Trump still has that option in his \"quiver,\" and the automakers would be encouraged to build engines in the United States.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump tweeted that China had agreed to cut import levies on American-made cars. Chinese regulators did not respond to requests for comment on the tweet. Neither country mentioned auto tariffs in their official briefings of the meeting on Saturday.",
    " Title: \"The Unraveling of the First 100 Days: A Closer Look at the Trump Administration's Recent Challenges\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the past ten days, the United States has witnessed a series of events that have shaken the political landscape, causing a significant shift from the relative normalcy of the first 100 days of the Trump administration. The country is currently grappling with a whirlwind of internal turmoil, as the President's actions have led to a wave of controversy and uncertainty.\n\nThe most notable events include the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey, the disclosure of classified information to the Russians, and the alleged attempt by President Trump to influence an ongoing investigation involving former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.\n\nThe firing of Comey, initially attributed to a Justice Department recommendation, has since been surrounded by layers of falsehoods, creating an impression of an elaborate cover-up in the absence of a clear crime. The disclosure of classified information to the Russians, while not an irreparable national-security calamity, has led to a cover-up that has far exceeded the initial crime.\n\nThe President's actions have also led to a series of contradictions and confusion, with top officials initially denying the disclosure story, only for the President to contradict them within 48 hours. This has led to a state of chaos, with the country seemingly caught in the internal maelstrom that is the President's mind.\n\nThe recent events have left the Republican party in a state of panic, with some suggesting the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the President. However, this idea has been met with criticism, as it is seen as a potential coup and a departure from the original intent of the amendment, which was designed to address a president's incapacitation, not their behavior or actions.\n\nThe future remains uncertain, as the country navigates through these challenging times. The focus now lies on strengthening the guardrails, redoubling oversight, and following the facts to ensure accountability and stability in the political landscape.",
    " Title: U.S. Revokes Travel Privileges for Bill Browder, Stirring Controversy on Capitol Hill\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States government's decision to revoke the travel privileges of Bill Browder, a prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has sparked concern on Capitol Hill. Browder, a key advocate for the Magnitsky Act, found himself barred from entering the U.S. in recent days, a situation that appears to be linked to Russia's decision to place Browder on the Interpol wanted list.\n\nSenators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) issued a joint statement on Monday, urging the Department of Homeland Security to expedite a review of the decision to revoke Browder's visa. They expressed their concern that the U.S. might be barring him based on the same Russian officials targeted by the Magnitsky Act, a bipartisan legislation aimed at punishing human rights abusers in Russia.\n\nBrowder, a British citizen, revealed in an interview on Monday that his Global Entry status, a program administered by Customs and Border Protection that allows expedited entry into the U.S. for trusted travelers, had been revoked. When he attempted to book a flight to the U.S., he was denied boarding due to a visa issue. Browder uses the Electronic System for Travel Authorization to gain entry into the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program.\n\n\"I discovered that my Global Entry status had been revoked,\" Browder said. \"We then checked into a flight to Newark and the airline wouldn't let me check in, wouldn't let me board because of the visa issue.\"\n\nBrowder added that he learned of Russia's actions on October 17, when they added him to the Interpol diffusion system.\n\nBill Browder is a British financier who has been a significant driving force behind the Magnitsky Act, a law passed in 2012 that is named after Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was jailed after exposing a tax fraud scheme and died under suspicious circumstances. Browder was one of Magnitsky's clients.\n\nBrowder's support for the law has made him an adversary of Moscow. Russia has previously, on four occasions, petitioned Interpol to secure Browder's arrest, but the international police organization has rejected these requests, deeming them politically motivated.\n\nIn the past, Browder's visa privileges were revoked as a result of Russia's actions, but he said the U.S. government had previously resolved the issue within hours.\n\n\"I am hopeful that this is just a technical issue driven by Interpol and it will be resolved quickly,\" Browder said on Monday.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for more information. Browder said he received little information from Homeland Security when he inquired about his Global Entry status in recent days.\n\n\"After waiting for an hour and a half, I got through to a representative who told me that they couldn't disclose why my Global Entry had been revoked, and if I wanted to find out, I should file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request,\" Browder said. \"I only learned why when I went to my law enforcement contacts about Interpol.\"\n\nBrowder discovered that he had again been targeted by Russia just after Canada passed its version of the Magnitsky Act last week. Russia is seeking Browder's arrest on charges of tax evasion and murder.\n\nIn a public address on Thursday, Putin accused Canada of playing \"unconstructive political games\" and labeled Browder as a criminal. The revelation that Browder's visa had been revoked prompted immediate criticism from opponents of the Trump administration.\n\n\"This is outrageous. @realDonaldTrump, @StateDept et al, fix this now. Now. Do not join Putin's campaign against @Billbrowder,\" tweeted Michael McFaul, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Moscow under the Obama administration.",
    " Title: North Korea's Internet Service Restored After Days of Outage, According to Reports\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing a prolonged disruption of more than nine hours and 30 minutes, Internet service in North Korea has reportedly been restored, according to technology news service Dyn Research. Although access remains partial, the country's main news service and newspaper are now back online.\n\nThe outage, which began late Friday and continued through Monday, had left North Korea's Internet access unstable, according to Doug Madory, the director of Internet analysis at Dyn Research. He shared this information with The New York Times and other news organizations.\n\nSan Francisco-based CloudFlare, a network and security company that monitors global Web access, told The Times that North Korea's Internet access was \"toast.\" The cause of the outage remains unclear.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Marie Harf stated today, \"We are not going to discuss publicly operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way except to say that as we implement our responses, some will be seen, some may not be seen.\"\n\nIn an interview with NPR's Elise Hu, Matthew Prince, chief executive of CloudFlare, outlined four possible scenarios for the outage: North Korea turned off its own Internet; China's upstream provider turned it off; the country's routers failed at an unfortunate time; or it was the result of a denial-of-service attack from either a hacking group or the U.S. Prince expressed doubt that the U.S. was behind the reported outage.\n\nNorth Korea has one of the lowest Internet penetrations in the world, with access limited mostly to the country's elite. The U.S. has linked the recent hacking of Sony Pictures to North Korean hackers, though North Korea itself has denied responsibility. There are computer security experts who question whether Pyongyang is behind the hack.\n\nLast week, Sony canceled the planned Christmas Day release of The Interview, a comedy that centers on a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The decision followed threats against moviegoers and theaters that showed the film. The threats were attributed to the group that claimed responsibility for hacking Sony.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Grants Stay on Injunction Against Border Wall Funding, Casts Doubt on Plaintiffs' Standing\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Supreme Court of the United States has granted the Trump administration's request to stay a district court's permanent injunction against the diversion of $2.5 billion in military spending for the construction of portions of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. This decision effectively allows the wall construction to proceed.\n\nThe background of the case is relatively straightforward. When President Trump announced his intention to build the border wall without specific congressional authorization, he identified multiple funding sources to finance the project. The source at issue in this case is the $2.5 billion transferred under the Department of Defense funds transferred for Support for Counterdrug Activities (Title 10 United States Code, section 284), not the $3.6 billion reallocated from Department of Defense military construction projects under the national emergency declaration.\n\nThe Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition filed a lawsuit, alleging that the funding diversion would harm the environment and that it represented an improper, unlawful diversion of funds in violation of specific congressional appropriations. However, the private parties' claims of concrete and legally-recognized injuries as a result of the government's action were less clear, leading to questions about their standing to enforce the conditions in the statute.\n\nIn its application for a stay, the Trump administration argued that the \"injunction was entered at the behest of private parties whose asserted recreational and aesthetic interests in the enjoyment of public lands do not fall within the zone of interests protected by the transfer statute, and who are thus not, in any event, proper plaintiffs to sue to enforce the conditions in that statute.\"\n\nFive justices of the Supreme Court agreed, at least for now, holding that it \"among the reasons\" it granted the stay \"is that the Government has made a sufficient showing at this stage that the plaintiffs have no cause of action to obtain review\" of the relevant administrative action.\n\nIt is essential to note that this is not a final judgment for the administration, nor does it represent a ruling that the administration's diversion of funds was lawful. It merely casts substantial doubt on whether the plaintiffs are the right parties to seek to protect Congressional authority. The stay remains in effect while the Ninth Circuit decides the case and until ultimate disposition in the Supreme Court.\n\nThis decision is significant because it raises questions about the ability of private parties to enforce Congress's appropriation power. The Supreme Court may ultimately decide this case on the merits, but for now, it is right to cast doubt on a sweeping lower-court injunction granted on behalf of plaintiffs who have yet to adequately articulate the legally recognized harms they've suffered in what is ultimately a battle between Congress and the president of the United States.",

According to local news station KOIN 6, Kitzhaber met with administration officials Friday morning to announce his plans.\n\nReports emerged earlier this week that Hayes had accepted nearly $200,000 in payments from green nonprofits to work on controversial low-carbon fuel standard policies, simultaneously as the administration was promoting new legislation on the issue.\n\nKitzhaber's resignation will take effect at 10 a.m. on Wednesday. Oregon Secretary of State Kate Brown is expected to assume the office, making her the nation's first openly bisexual governor.\n\nOregon Senate Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli expressed his sentiments Friday morning during a gathering of the Oregon Wheat Grower League outside the capitol, stating, \"What should be a day of celebration is turning into a day of reflection and mourning.\"\n\nFerrioli further stated that he would not attend Brown's swearing-in but instead would return home \"to grieve for the departure in disgrace of one governor and to hope for the healing that can only come if the next governor turns away from policies that put symbolic gestures ahead of the real needs of our citizens.\"\n\nOregon House Republican Leader Mike McLane described the situation as \"a sad day for Oregon.\" He added, \"I take no delight in John Kitzhaber's resignation but understand his decision.

    " Title: Supreme Court Declines to Hear Challenge on Origination Clause and Obamacare\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to take up an appeal that contends Congress violated the Constitution by initiating the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in the wrong chamber. The court has previously ruled on various aspects of the Affordable Care Act, including its mandates, government subsidies, and birth control rules, but has now opted against delving into a conservative group's bid to nullify the entire law based on the origination clause.\n\nThe Pacific Legal Foundation argued that the Affordable Care Act of 2010, with its implementation of hundreds of billions in taxes, falls under the Founding Fathers' vision of revenue bills, which should originate in the House of Representatives. Since the key language of Obamacare originated in the Senate, opponents claim this violates the Constitution's requirement that money bills begin in the House.\n\nLower courts have ruled that the primary purpose of the law is to ensure more Americans have health insurance, not to generate revenue. They also argue that Congress used an acceptable maneuver to bypass the origination clause.\n\nThe origination question has been a point of contention since Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.'s 2015 decision, which declared that while the individual mandate was not allowed under Congress' powers to control interstate commerce, it was valid as an exercise of its taxing power.\n\nThe Pacific Legal Foundation's plaintiff, Matt Sissel, is an Iraq War veteran and small business owner who pays for his own medical bills and objects to being compelled to purchase health insurance he does not need or want. The foundation stated that Sissel's opposition is based on financial, philosophical, and constitutional grounds.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit dismissed Sissel's suit in August, arguing that the primary purpose of the law was not to raise money. Other judges on the panel suggested that Obamacare should be classified as a revenue bill, but concluded that Congress did not violate the origination clause, as the Senate inserted text into a legislative shell from the House.\n\nOpponents of the overhaul have not had much success before the high court. The justices upheld the law as constitutional in 2012, although the court did allow states to opt out of expanding Medicaid under the law. Last year, plaintiffs in King v. Burwell argued that the law's text limited subsidies to states that established their own exchanges. However, the court ruled that the law, when read in its entirety, allowed qualified Americans to qualify for tax credits regardless of their state of residence.\n\nThe Constitutional Accountability Center stated on Tuesday that \"the ultimate outcome of challenges like this one aren't in doubt,\" suggesting that opponents of Obamacare should cease their legal efforts. \"They are simply meritless,\" said the center's chief counsel, Elizabeth Wydra. \"The Court upheld the ACA for the second time just last June, with Chief Justice Roberts picking up a sixth vote to send a clear signal that he's had enough of what has become a blatant ideological crusade. One questions whether anti-Obamacare legal activists have gotten the message.\"",

Trump, who reportedly watches the show most mornings, has a close relationship with \"Morning Joe\" host Joe Scarborough, and they communicate regularly.\n\nFox News' \"The O'Reilly Factor\" and other prime-time programs on Fox News have seen a 50% increase in their ad rates. Trump is also a regular viewer of Fox News' prime-time shows.\n\n\"The president's media habits are so predictable, advertisers migrate to those areas,\" said one media buyer.\n\nA prominent D.C. consultant revealed that some of his clients, including a major bank and a significant pharmaceutical company, were in negotiations this week to purchase ads on \"O'Reilly\" and \"Morning Joe.\" These clients aim to reach the president, who is known to respond directly to what he sees on television and tweet about it.\n\n\"It's like speaking directly into the president's ear,\" the consultant said, adding that some companies are proactively placing ads to avoid a Trump tweet, or in at least one instance, to prompt Trump to tweet against their competitors.\n\nAn MSNBC source acknowledged that ad rates for \"Morning Joe\" would likely increase due to strategically placed ad buys in New York and D.C.

    " Title: Camp David's History of High-Stakes Diplomacy: A Look at Past Presidential Meetings\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The recent controversy surrounding President Donald Trump's proposed meeting with the Taliban at Camp David has brought renewed attention to the historic presidential retreat's role in high-stakes diplomacy.\n\nBuilt by Depression-era Works Progress Administration workers in the 1930s, the secluded camp, tucked into a mountainous national park in Maryland, has been a venue for world leaders to discuss and resolve complex international issues.\n\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt converted the facility into a presidential retreat, renaming it Shangri-La. In 1943, he hosted British Prime Minister Winston Churchill there during World War II, a meeting that took place as Germany was pushing across Europe. The Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum holds a photograph of the two leaders fishing at the retreat, with Roosevelt holding a fly rod and Churchill his trademark cigar.\n\nIn 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who named the retreat Camp David after his father and grandson, met with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev there. At a point of high Cold War tension, the two leaders made some progress, such as agreeing to open talks on the administration of war-torn Berlin. However, much of the goodwill was scuttled when an American U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union months later.\n\nPerhaps the most famous international gathering to take place at Camp David happened under President Jimmy Carter. In 1978, Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the site to broker a peace accord named for the retreat. The touch-and-go negotiations took place over 12 days \u2013 all of it in secret.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton attempted to recreate the sense of momentum in the Middle East with his own summit in 2000, but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat failed to reach an agreement.\n\nEisenhower wasn't the only president to host Russians at Camp David. President George W. Bush hosted Vladimir Putin in 2003, and President Barack Obama held a G8 summit at Camp David in 2012, when the Russians were still part of the group of the world's most industrialized economies. Obama hosted the Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nThe meeting, had it occurred, would have delivered the kind of drama that appeals to Trump, a former TV star. However, it wouldn't have been the first time the sprawling retreat has been used for high-stakes diplomacy.",
    " Title: Conservative Groups Scramble to Prove Election Impact as Spending Reaches Unprecedented Levels\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 elections, outside groups, which have been notorious for their secretive spending, are facing the possibility of spending over $1 billion without electing Mitt Romney or delivering a GOP Senate. As a result, these groups are taking steps to prove their effectiveness and justify their substantial investments.\n\nFor two years, these conservative super PACs and outside groups have maintained a veil of secrecy, withholding details about their strategies, methods, and donors. However, with the elections behind them, the need to demonstrate their impact has become paramount.\n\nOne of the most secretive groups, Americans for Prosperity, the political arm of the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, has recently begun to disclose its spending, revealing $72 million worth of ad buys. This shift in strategy is a response to the potential outcome of the elections, as conservative super PACs and outside groups may have failed to elect Romney or secure a GOP Senate.\n\nOperatives running these super PACs and nonprofits are now working to position themselves as influential players, claiming credit for successes, avoiding blame for failures, and demonstrating their versatility beyond narrowly targeted advertising.\n\nKarl Rove's Crossroads outfit, which primarily focused on television ads supporting Romney and GOP Senate candidates, has expanded its efforts to include House races and get-out-the-vote activities, collaborating with Ralph Reed's evangelical mobilization group, Faith and Freedom Coalition.\n\nA coalition of groups within the Koch brothers' network, including Americans for Prosperity, 60 Plus, Concerned Women for America, and CitizenLink, recently convened to discuss strategies for demonstrating their value to donors.\n\nThe pro-Romney Restore Our Future super PAC has been highlighting its advertising in Michigan and Wisconsin, claiming it made both states competitive, while the American Future Fund has distinguished itself by spending on anti-Obama ads in traditionally Democratic states such as Minnesota.\n\nAs the election concludes, these groups anticipate a significant restructuring of the conservative organizations that benefited from an unprecedented influx of cash due to wealthy Republicans' antipathy towards President Barack Obama and the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which loosened campaign finance rules.\n\nIdaho businessman Frank VanderSloot, who has contributed $1.1 million to Restore Our Future and hinted at donations to Crossroads, expressed his expectations for the post-election reshuffling, stating, \"Without question, after it's over, there is going to be a sorting out of who got the job done, and I think there will be some who might lay claim to accomplishments that they maybe didn't personally accomplish.\"\n\nVanderSloot further added, \"Some of these organizations will gain in stature, and some will probably fall by the wayside.\" The post-election period is expected to reveal which groups have made a significant impact and which may struggle to maintain their relevance in the future.",
    " Title: Special Counsel Acquires Communications of Erik Prince in Russian Probe\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, special counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly acquired the communications of Erik Prince, the Blackwater founder who has acknowledged cooperating with the Russian probe. According to a report, Prince, a close ally of President Donald Trump, has provided investigators with complete access to his phones and computer.\n\nPrince's spokesman confirmed to ABC News that he has spoken voluntarily with Congress and cooperated fully with the special counsel's investigation. The spokesman added that Prince will keep his opinions to himself and allow the investigators to carry out their work.\n\nThe spokesman also stated that much of the reporting and speculation about Prince in the media is inaccurate, and they are confident that when the investigators have finished their work, they will be able to put these distractions aside.\n\nIn March, Mueller's probe reportedly uncovered evidence that a secret meeting in Seychelles shortly before President Trump's inauguration was intended to create a back channel between the incoming administration and the Kremlin. The January 2017 meeting between Prince and a Russian official close to strongman Vladimir Putin was coordinated to discuss how the Trump administration could communicate with Moscow, according to a Washington Post report.\n\nPrince has previously testified that the meeting with Kirill Dmitriev, the Putin-appointed head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, was a chance encounter \"over a beer.\" However, ABC News reported earlier this year that Mueller had obtained evidence that created doubt about that testimony.\n\nInvestigators believe the meeting was intended to establish a line of communication between the countries that was outside normal diplomatic channels. The information came to light after it was revealed that Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, a representative of the United Arab Emirates who was part of the Seychelles meeting, was cooperating with Mueller's probe under immunity.\n\nIt was unclear whether Mueller's office would prosecute Prince or even make a referral to the US attorney for the District of Columbia if they found convincing evidence of perjury, according to ABC News.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, welcomed the renewed focus on Prince. \"I have a lot of questions about whether he was being straight with us,\" Swalwell told ABC News. \"I'm heartened to hear that the special counsel is doing what Republicans on the committee were not willing to do... and follow up and not take Mr. Prince at his word.\"",
    " Title: Obama Seeks Congressional Support for Limited Ground Operations Against Islamic State, Clarifies 'No Boots on the Ground' Pledge\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift from previous U.S. military interventions, President Barack Obama has requested Congressional support for limited ground operations against the Islamic State (ISIL) in Iraq and Syria. This move comes after more than 1,900 airstrikes over the past six months, which the President has maintained are authorized under existing law.\n\nIn a letter to lawmakers on Wednesday, Mr. Obama emphasized that the proposed authorization does not signify the commencement of another ground war akin to Afghanistan or Iraq. He reiterated his stance against prolonged ground wars in the Middle East, stating, \"I'm convinced that the United States should not get dragged back into another prolonged ground war in the Middle East.\"\n\nThe President clarified his earlier pledge against \"boots on the ground,\" stating that the proposed measure would rule out \"enduring offensive ground combat operations.\" However, he left room for limited ground action, such as rescue operations or the use of Special Operations forces to target ISIL leadership.\n\nFurthermore, the legislation would allow for the use of ground forces for intelligence gathering, spotting ground targets for airstrikes, and planning assistance to ground troops of allies like the Iraqi government.\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Obama also addressed the potential use of U.S. forces in the event of actionable intelligence about a gathering of ISIL leaders. He stated, \"If we had actionable intelligence about a gathering of ISIL leaders, and our partners didn't have the capacity to get them, I would be prepared to order our special forces to take action, because I will not allow these terrorists to have a safe haven.\"\n\nThis move towards seeking Congressional approval for limited ground operations marks a departure from the historical precedent of U.S. presidents engaging in military action without explicit authorization from Congress, as seen in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the two Iraq Wars.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Primary Results: Ted Cruz Secures Victory, Altering GOP Presidential Race Landscape\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift for the Republican presidential race, Sen. Ted Cruz has been projected to win the Wisconsin primary Tuesday, dealing a substantial blow to GOP front-runner Donald Trump. The victory marks a turning point in the race as it moves east later this month.\n\nAccording to network projections based on exit polling, Cruz led Trump by 53 percent to 30 percent with 37 percent of precincts reporting. John Kasich trailed with 15 percent.\n\nCruz, speaking at his election night party, hailed the victory as a \"rallying cry\" and a \"call from the hardworking men and women of Wisconsin to the people of America.\" He emphasized his growing momentum, citing the backing he has received from five of his former GOP presidential rivals and recent victories in Utah, Colorado, and North Dakota.\n\n\"Either before Cleveland or at the convention in Cleveland, together we will earn the majority of the delegates and together we will beat Hillary Clinton in November,\" Cruz said.\n\nCruz's victory is seen as a consolidation of anti-Trump voters within the GOP, as he and Trump went head-to-head in Wisconsin, making multiple appearances to build support. Trump, however, struggled to recover from a difficult week that included his campaign manager's battery charge and his own stumbles on abortion and other conservative issues.\n\nTrump's campaign has been marked by a decline in poll numbers among female voters, prompting him to bring his wife Melania onto the campaign trail.\n\nThe Cruz victory makes it more challenging for Trump to secure the nomination outright on the first ballot at the July convention. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the third man in the race, has vowed to stay in the race despite another loss.\n\nKasich's campaign strategist, John Weaver, issued a memo before polls closed, stating, \"This week will be remembered as the one in which Ted Cruz and Donald Trump both effectively admitted they will not reach the GOP Convention with enough bound delegates to be the nominee.\"\n\nKasich argues, and polling confirms, that he runs the best of the three GOP candidates against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. However, GOP primary voters have shown little interest in this aspect, focusing instead on choosing their champion.\n\nTrump is hoping to avoid a contested convention, which would give most delegates, many of them party regulars not thrilled with Trump, the chance to cast their support behind whoever they please after the first ballot.\n\nExit polls from Wisconsin showed that 56 percent of GOP voters believe the candidate who has collected the most votes in the primaries should win the party's nomination. Four in ten favored a contested convention, with delegates selecting the nominee.\n\nTrump's proposals, such as a temporary freeze on non-US Muslims entering the country, were popular among seven in ten voters, according to exit polls. Trade was a significant concern for over half of Republican voters, who felt the United States was getting the raw end of trade deals.\n\nSix in ten GOP voters supported a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, while a third called for their deportation. Half of the voters sought a candidate with political experience, and about half wanted a candidate from outside the political establishment.\n\nCruz was seen as the GOP's best bet to beat Hillary Clinton in a general election match-up, followed by Trump and Kasich.",
    " Title: Parallels and Divergences: The Midterm Elections of 2018 and 2006 Compared\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape of 2018, the indictments of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, and the arrest of Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) on insider trading charges, along with the guilty plea of Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr. (R-Calif.) and his wife Margaret Hunter on charges of using campaign funds for personal expenses, have raised questions about the potential impact on the upcoming midterm elections. This series of events, reminiscent of the political scandals that unfolded in the final days of September 2006, has led some to draw parallels with the midterm elections of that year, when the Democratic Party made significant gains.\n\nIn 2006, the war in Iraq was not going well, and a series of political scandals involving top White House aide Scooter Libby, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, and other high-profile Republicans, including Reps. Bob Ney (R-Ohio) and Duke Cunningham (R-Calif.), unfolded. However, these scandals did not seal the deal for the rival party in the midterms. The turning point came when it was revealed that Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.) had sent inappropriate text messages to male, teenage House pages. The Foley news erupted in the final hours of Congress trying to wrap up work in Washington and head home to campaign for the midterm elections.\n\nThe Foley scandal, coupled with the political scandals that preceded it, led to a Democratic victory in both the House and Senate. It remains to be seen if the events of August 21, 2018, will have a similar impact on the midterm elections.\n\nOne key difference between the two periods is the response of President Trump and his supporters. In 2006, the Republican Party was in disarray, with many members of Congress distancing themselves from the unpopular President George W. Bush. In contrast, President Trump has maintained high approval ratings among his base, and his supporters have remained loyal despite the ongoing scandals.\n\nAnother difference is the political climate. In 2006, the country was deeply divided over the war in Iraq, and the public was growing increasingly disillusioned with the Bush administration. In 2018, while there are certainly issues that divide the country, the political landscape is more complex, with a variety of factors at play.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the indictments and guilty pleas of Manafort, Cohen, and the Hunters have nothing to do with each other, and the Collins charges are not related in any way to the Manafort and Cohen cases. However, the timing of these events has raised questions about the potential impact on the midterm elections.\n\nSome have suggested that the events of August 21 offer keen insight on the midterm elections, but others caution against drawing too many conclusions. The midterms are still several months away, and there are many uncertainties about seats in play in Virginia, Texas, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Nevada, and Minnesota.\n\nOne thing is certain: the midterms are shaping up to be a critical test of the political landscape, and the events of August 21 may provide some clues, but they do not tell the whole story. The midterms are still several months away, and there is still much that can happen, including an \"October Surprise\" that could tip the balance one way or the other. As always, the political landscape is dynamic, and the outcome of the midterms remains uncertain.",
    " Title: Analysis: Trump's Speech to Congress: A Mixed Bag of Unity and Division\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, a recurring pattern emerged: whenever Donald Trump's erratic behavior and self-created controversies threatened his campaign, his aides would schedule a prepared speech before a sober audience. Trump would dutifully read what had been written for him, usually looking bored, but sounding calm and tempered compared to his usual self. This led many to wonder if this was a new, more presidential Trump. However, within 24 hours, the old Trump would return, with one of his brutish rallies and petty, vindictive tweets.\n\nTuesday night's speech before a joint session of Congress was not as insincere as those earlier ones, and it was far better written\u2014even if it contained the usual load of misleading statements and outright falsehoods. The speech, however, was a testament to the internal tension within Trump's administration, between the desire to let Trump be Trump and the urge to reach for rhetoric that might make it seem as though, if only for a moment, Trump actually wanted to be a president for all Americans.\n\nThe speech began with a paragraph that seemed to be pasted on at the last minute, addressing the recent rise in anti-Semitic incidents. This section, in particular, raised questions about Trump's understanding and empathy towards these issues. The president has been criticized for his response to the rise in anti-Semitic incidents, and his comments about these attacks being potentially false-flag operations have been particularly controversial.\n\nDespite these issues, the speech contained moments of unity and calls for cooperation. Trump spoke about the need to build bridges of cooperation and trust, and he emphasized the shared values and destiny of all Americans. However, these approving words about common purpose and identity were often juxtaposed with the usual Trumpian notes of division, fear, and dismissal of those who do not already support him.\n\nThe speech also contained several instances of fear-mongering, such as Trump's description of a fictitious crime wave and his pledge to \"dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation.\" The establishment of the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement office, which is intended to tally and publicize crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, was particularly controversial.\n\nIn conclusion, while Trump's speech to Congress was better written and contained moments of unity, it was still a reflection of the internal tension within his administration and the real Trump administration in action. The speech was a reminder that, despite Trump's ability to act almost presidential for an hour, there are few Americans left who believe that Trump truly wants to bring us all together. And, as history has shown, within a matter of hours, he will likely return to Twitter and his true self.",
    " Title: Egypt's Interim President Delays Appointment of ElBaradei as Prime Minister\n\nArticle:\n\nCairo, Egypt - Egypt's interim President Adly Mansour has delayed the appointment of Mohammed ElBaradei as interim prime minister, following a reversal in the decision that was initially announced on Saturday. The move comes amidst ongoing political turmoil and deepening divisions in the country.\n\nMansour, who was installed by the military as an interim leader following the ouster of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, on Wednesday, had earlier announced ElBaradei's appointment. However, the appointment was later rescinded due to objections from the ultraconservative Salafi el-Nour party, according to a senior opposition official, Munir Fakhry Abdelnur.\n\nThe initial announcement of ElBaradei's appointment was made in a room at the presidential palace, where reporters were gathered, leading to speculation and anticipation. However, Mansour's spokesman, Ahmed el-Musalamani, later denied that the appointment of the Nobel Peace laureate was ever certain.\n\nTensions remain high in Cairo, with tens of thousands of Morsi supporters rallying for a third day near a mosque in a Cairo neighborhood that has traditionally been a stronghold of Islamists. The protesters are chanting angry slogans against Wednesday's toppling of Morsi by General Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who has denied the military staged a coup, stating he was acting on the wishes of millions of Egyptians protesting the ex-Islamist leader.\n\nMansour, 67, the former chief justice of the country's constitutional court, met with el-Sissi, Interior Minister Mohammed Ibrahim, and the three young leaders of Tamarod, the youth opposition group behind the series of mass protests that led to Morsi's ouster, on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood has vowed to boycott the political process, labeling the military's actions as a coup that overturned a democratically elected government. Morsi, a U.S.-trained engineer, remains under detention in an undisclosed location.\n\nThe political situation in Egypt remains fluid, with the interim president and the military facing opposition from Islamist groups and calls for support from the youth opposition. The events of the past few days underscore the deep divisions in the country and the challenges that lie ahead for the interim government.",
    " Title: Congress Faces End-of-Year Deadline as Leaders Disagree on Tax Rates, Fiscal Cliff Negotiations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Tuesday's election, both Democratic and Republican congressional leaders have agreed that the current fiscal situation, often referred to as the \"fiscal cliff,\" requires compromise to avoid. However, they continue to disagree over the key issue of whether top tax rates should be raised as part of the solution.\n\nThe fiscal cliff refers to the combination of massive spending cuts and the expiration of tax breaks, including the Bush-era tax cuts, set to take effect at the end of December. The fiscal cliff also includes automatic across-the-board spending cuts, known as sequestration, set to trigger at the beginning of 2013 if Capitol Hill fails to create a deficit-reduction plan.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner sounded conciliatory in a formal speech on Capitol Hill, even as he made it clear that higher tax rates would be unacceptable to Republicans who control the House. Boehner proposed a framework for a bipartisan agreement that includes new revenue, but only under the right conditions, and not from higher tax rates on higher earners. Instead, he suggested revenue come from a simpler, cleaner, fair tax code with fewer loopholes and lower rates for all.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, on the other hand, insisted that raising taxes on wealthier Americans has to be part of any compromise to resolve the crisis. Reid argued that the American people sent a message during the election that those making all this money have to contribute a little bit more.\n\nBoehner and top House GOP leaders held a conference call with all House Republicans before the speaker made his speech. According to two participants on the call, the speaker gave a full readout of what he planned to say publicly, and while he reinforced his pledge not to agree to tax increases, he did urge rank and file members to give him some room to negotiate with the White House.\n\nAs the end-of-the-year deadline approaches, both parties will need to find common ground to avoid the fiscal cliff and its potential negative impact on the economy. The stakes are high, and the clock is ticking.",
    " Title: Bush's Legacy Lives On Through Supreme Court Appointments: A Comparison with Trump's Legacy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of former President George H.W. Bush's passing, his legacy has been a topic of much discussion, particularly in comparison to the current President, Donald Trump. While their political styles differed greatly, their legacies share a striking similarity: both nominated Supreme Court justices who faced allegations of sexual misconduct, and both stood by their nominees during their confirmation battles.\n\nClarence Thomas, nominated by Bush in 1991, has served on the Supreme Court for 27 years, his decisions affecting Americans long after Bush, a one-term president, left office. Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's appointee, is also likely to serve for decades, outlasting Trump's presidency regardless of the 2020 election results.\n\nBush's nomination of Thomas was controversial from the start. After the retirement of Justice Thurgood Marshall, Bush could have honored his legacy by naming a respected African-American judge or legal scholar. Instead, he selected a staunch conservative in Clarence Thomas, who today is known as the most conservative member of the Court.\n\nAfter Thomas was nominated, Anita Hill's allegations against him surfaced. She claimed that he had subjected her to unwanted sexual comments during their time working together at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Bush was undeterred. He declared his \"total confidence\" in Thomas, and after Hill and Thomas testified before the Senate, he called Thomas' statement \"very powerful and convincing.\"\n\nHill was mocked and criticized in the press and in the Senate. As a result, the Thomas confirmation battle could have been a turning point in American history, one where women's rights in the workplace and in the public square might have vaulted forward. Instead, Bush chose to side with a man who multiple women described as harassing them.\n\nThomas was confirmed on October 15, 1991. He went on to vote consistently against abortion rights, in such cases as Gonzales v. Carhart, which upheld a ban on so-called \"partial-birth abortions.\" In a joint opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, he wrote that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided.\n\nHe also voted with the majority in 2010's Citizens United v. FEC, leading to an explosion of Super PAC spending and dark money in elections. And in 2000's Bush v. Gore, his vote helped George H.W. Bush's son become president of the United States.\n\nAt 70, Thomas likely has years left on the Court. (Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the oldest justice, is 85.) And while Thomas is not necessarily considered influential, his vote continues to matter. Now that Kavanaugh and Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch sit on the Court, anti-abortion advocates believe they have enough votes to overturn Roe. Perhaps the surest of those votes is Thomas, a staunch opponent of abortion throughout his career. Without him, opponents of abortion on the Court might still be one short of a majority.\n\nMany have commented on the similarities between Thomas' confirmation process and Kavanaugh's. Those similarities extend to the role of the president. Bush, as many obituary writers have pointed out, is more polished than Trump. But Trump's defenses of Kavanaugh in many ways mirrored Bush's defense of Thomas.\n\nBush, as many obituary writers have pointed out, is more polished than Trump. But Trump's defenses of Kavanaugh in many ways mirrored Bush's defense of Thomas. \"A man's life is in tatters. A man's life is shattered,\" Trump said of the allegations against Kavanaugh, echoing Bush's claim that Thomas had been smeared and should be allowed to clear his name.\n\nTrump also publicly mocked Christine Blasey Ford, who said that Kavanaugh assaulted her when they were in high school, making fun of her for being unable to remember certain details of the evening she described. Bush didn't do the same to Hill, but he may have had a role in the way she was mocked by others.\n\nNew York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, who covered the Bush White House, lays some of the blame for Hill's treatment on the late former president in a remembrance published Sunday: \"his White House directed the defense of his Supreme Court nominee, Clarence Thomas, that tried to discredit Anita Hill.\"\n\nAnd now that Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed, the effect of Trump's and Bush's defenses will be the same. Both men have succeeded in pushing onto the Court someone accused of sexual misconduct against a woman, whose decisions will affect all American women\u2014indeed, all Americans\u2014for decades to come.\n\nWhen it comes to the Supreme Court, Trump's legacy might look a lot like Bush's. Style matters less than substance, and there are few decisions more substantial than the decision of what kind of person deserves to spend his or her life on the country's highest court, handing down rulings that can shape the country for generations.",
    " Title: Global Carbon Emissions Decline During Pandemic, But Climate Change Remains a Concern\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the global carbon emissions have seen a significant decline during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. However, this decrease does little to address the pressing issue of climate change, as the planet continues to break climate change records.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, the atmospheric concentration of carbon hit a new record of 416.21 parts per million in April, marking the highest level in 800,000 years based on ice core records. This indicates that one year of relatively declining carbon output will not be enough to combat climate change without long-term transformations in the biggest climate fuel sources, including electricity, industrial activity, and transportation.\n\nA new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change by the University of East Anglia and scientists with the international consortium Global Climate Project reveals that global carbon emissions fell by 17 percent between January and April of this year compared to daily levels in 2019. The aviation sector, which contributes the smallest portion of the global footprint, saw a 75 percent decrease, while ground transportation, cars, industrial manufacturing, and power demand were all down, though less dramatically.\n\nThe declines are unprecedented, but they only bring us back to the 2006 carbon emissions levels, and the effects are likely to be short-lived. The extent to which world leaders consider the net-zero emissions targets and the imperatives of climate change when planning their economic responses to COVID-19 will influence the pathway of CO2 emissions for decades to come, according to the authors of the Nature paper.\n\nClimate policy think tank Energy Innovation modeled economic projections from organizations such as Goldman Sachs and the U.S. Energy Information Agency and found that U.S. emissions will bounce back to business-as-usual by 2025. From 2030 onwards, the pandemic will have no material impact on pollution levels.\n\n\"We're still going to be relying on the same fossil fuel technology we relied on before the pandemic,\" says Megan Mahajan, an energy policy analyst with Energy Innovation. \"The types of fuels we're relying on have not changed. There isn't a fundamental shift from how we power our electricity, our homes, and modes of transportation. We can't just do things to make modest shifts in our energy demand of the nation.\"\n\nThe pandemic-induced shutdown has cut back on demand from the biggest consumers of energy, including industry, transportation, and power sectors. The outlet Carbon Brief estimated a 5 percent global drop in carbon, while the International Energy Agency estimated 8 percent. Last week, the U.S. Energy Information Agency projected that carbon emissions from the electric sector alone will fall 11 percent nationally this year, and renewable use is on track to eclipse coal for the first time ever.\n\nThese developments seemed impossible a few months ago. However, the uncertainty surrounding what happens next and everything depends on how governments respond. The Nature paper points out that emissions could eventually rebound to levels worse than before if politicians choose to delay climate programs, such as weakening standards for more efficient buildings and cleaner cars.",
    " Title: Arizona Governor Appoints Rep. Martha McSally to Fill John McCain's Senate Seat\n\nArticle:\n\nArizona Governor Doug Ducey has appointed Rep. Martha McSally to fill the Senate seat previously held by the late Sen. John McCain, just over a month after losing the race for Arizona's other Senate seat. The appointment was announced Tuesday morning, days after Sen. Jon Kyl confirmed his resignation from the role.\n\nIn a press release announcing her appointment, Ducey said that McSally \"is uniquely qualified to step up and fight for Arizona\u2019s interests in the U.S. Senate.\" McSally, a two-term congresswoman, gained national attention when she faced off against Democrat Rep. Kyrsten Sinema this fall as they both vied for the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Jeff Flake's decision not to run for re-election.\n\nSinema won the seat in a relatively close race, with Sinema winning 50 percent of the vote to McSally's 47.6 percent. McSally conceded six days after the election. That election was historic, with Sinema becoming the first female to represent Arizona in the Senate. Now, Arizona will be one of only a few states to be represented by two women.\n\nWith McSally's appointment, she and Sinema will be the only serving bipartisan pair of female senators representing their state. The only other instance of that happening was in New Hampshire from 2011 to 2017. There are several other pairs of female senators who will be in the Senate come 2019 -- in California, New Hampshire, Minnesota, and Nevada -- but the Arizona duo are the only ones of opposite parties.\n\nSix-term Republican Sen. John McCain passed away in late August, just days before the Republican primary in the race for Flake's seat. McCain held his seat for decades, but it lies within the power of the governor and not McCain's family to determine who will fill the spot until a special election can be held to formally fill it in 2020.\n\nAt a news conference today, Ducey said that he was grateful that McSally and Cindy McCain \"were able to get together and visit earlier this week and clear the air.\" Cindy McCain posted a tweet supporting the decision and calling on McSally to remember her husband's legacy.\n\n\"My husband\u2019s greatest legacy was placing service to AZ & USA ahead of his own self-interest. I respect @dougducey's decision to appoint @RepMcSally to fill the remainder of his term. Arizonans will be pulling for her, hoping that she will follow his example of selfless leadership,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nFor her part, McSally said that she looks forward to working with her recent rival Sinema, whom she accused of treason during the campaign, while they both serve as the state's representatives in the Senate for the next two years.\n\n\"I am humbled and grateful to have this opportunity to serve and be a voice for all Arizonans. I look forward to working with Senator-Elect Kyrsten Sinema and getting to work from day one,\" McSally said in Ducey's news release announcing her appointment.\n\nShe echoed that sentiment at the news conference hours later, saying that she texted Sinema this morning and plans to work with her in the Senate \"just like we did in the House.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of common ground between us and I'm ready to hit it running,\" McSally said.\n\nDucey noted that Sinema will be sworn in before McSally, making Sinema the senior Senator from Arizona. He said that decision was made in an effort to \"respect the will of the voters.\" Assuming McSally's appointment progresses, the special election for McCain's seat will be held in 2020, and then would be up for its regularly scheduled re-election in 2022. Should McSally continue forward, and run for re-election, she will have campaigned three times in six years, losing once.\n\nAnd since McCain won his sixth term in 2016 and Sinema's seat is up for re-election in 2024, Arizonans will have gone through five Senate elections in a decade.",
    " Title: Urgent Call to Temporarily Close Liquor Stores Amidst Rising Domestic Violence Rates During COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nArticle:\n\nIn response to a surge in domestic violence cases across the United States, a call for the temporary closure of liquor stores has been proposed as a potential solution to mitigate the crisis. The Fresno Sheriff's Department has reported a 77 percent increase in domestic violence reports over the past two weeks, while the Seattle Police Department has seen a 22 percent increase in calls, totaling 614 reports in the last fortnight. Similar trends are being observed in Boston, with domestic violence prevention organizations warning of a significant increase in cases.\n\nThe economic downturn, stay-at-home orders, and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic have created a volatile environment that experts believe is contributing to the rise in domestic violence. The combination of family confinement, sudden home-schooling demands, job loss, and the stress of an invisible viral threat has been identified as a \"toxic domestic brew.\" Alcohol, however, is the ingredient that turns this volatile mixture into a second public health crisis.\n\nAccording to data, just 10 percent of adults account for 75 percent of all alcohol sold, consuming 10 or more drinks per day. This excessive use impairs judgment, engenders anger, agitation, and dysphoria, and can lead to violent behavior. By reducing access to alcohol during the crisis, the frequency of home violence could be significantly reduced.\n\nHistorical examples such as Finland's liquor store employee strike in the 1970s and Sweden's curtailment of liquor store sales in the 1980s have shown a decrease in domestic violence. South Dakota's implementation of twice-daily sobriety breathalyzer checks for individuals with multiple arrests for drunk driving also resulted in a decrease in both drunk driving rates and domestic violence cases by about 10 percent.\n\nThe current situation, however, presents a unique challenge due to the isolation measures in place to combat the spread of the coronavirus. These measures have made it more difficult to identify domestic abuse, as victims are often identified through contact with professionals outside the home. With telemedicine visits replacing in-person contact, victims remain in their homes with their abusers, and video encounters provide no privacy or the perception of privacy that in-person consultation offers.\n\nThe cascading effects of domestic violence also exacerbate the pandemic. Each house call by police or paramedics is another opportunity for the disease to spread. It consumes time and personal protective equipment that are in desperately short supply. Any preventable visit to the emergency room chokes off that bottlenecked resource. And even trips to the liquor store are an avoidable reason for people to come into contact under stay-at-home orders.\n\nWhile the temporary closure of liquor stores will come at some cost, the benefits to domestic violence victims and potential victims during this crisis should be prioritized. Doctors will need to be on the lookout for patients who may be in need of extensive assistance during alcohol withdrawal, as many who are addicted to alcohol will have to endure the physical effects of withdrawal. For most, it lasts days and is deeply unpleasant. For about 5 percent, it can be life-threatening without medical care.\n\nDr. Peter B. Bach, a physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City, emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the benefits to domestic violence victims and potential victims during this crisis. \"When supports for sobriety are low and alcohol supply is high, more people get intoxicated and inflict harm on themselves and their families,\" he stated.\n\nIn conclusion, the temporary closure of liquor stores could be an effective measure in reducing domestic violence rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it may present challenges, the potential benefits to victims and potential victims should be prioritized during this unprecedented time.",
    " Title: Unprecedented Upset in Michigan Primary: Bernie Sanders Defeats Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump Sweeps Michigan and Mississippi\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders pulled off a significant upset in Michigan's Democratic primary Tuesday night, beating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a race that most polls had him trailing by double digits. This victory eclipses Clinton's earlier win in Mississippi, marking the ninth and largest state that Sanders has won so far in the Democratic presidential campaign.\n\nOn the Republican side, front-runner Donald Trump regained any momentum lost last weekend against challenger Ted Cruz, securing convincing victories in Michigan and Mississippi. Cruz was projected to pick up a win in the Idaho GOP primary, while Trump was projected to easily win the Hawaii Republican caucus.\n\nTrump's earlier victories were more valuable in terms of delegates. Tuesday's results may also seal the fate of Marco Rubio, who, once again, failed to gain any delegates. Cruz appeared to have beaten John Kasich for second place in Michigan by approximately 8,000 votes. Kasich is counting on a win in his home state of Ohio next week to salvage his campaign.\n\nIn Mississippi, Trump defeated Cruz by 47 percent to 36 percent of the vote, with Kasich a distant third at 9 percent and Rubio garnering just 5 percent of the vote. Trump celebrated his wins at a lengthy press conference Tuesday night, teasing the \"special interests\" and others that ran ads against him.\n\nLooking ahead, Rubio is looking for a comeback win in his home state next week, all the while battling calls from his rivals to drop out. Clinton, meanwhile, is still trying to regain her footing as Sanders has demonstrated his grassroots support in several recent contests. Over the weekend, he claimed three victories to Clinton's one.\n\nThanks in part to so-called \"superdelegates\" \u2013 party leaders and officials free to support whomever they want \u2013 Clinton maintains a huge delegate lead over Sanders. She had 1,221 to Sanders' 571, as of early Wednesday morning.\n\nIn terms of the delegate count on the GOP side, Trump leads Cruz 446 to 347, with Rubio trailing at 151 and Kasich at 54, as of early Wednesday morning. Both Trump and Clinton had a mixed performance this past weekend, where they effectively split the delegate field with their top rivals. The stakes on Tuesday arguably were higher for Trump, whose delegate lead over Cruz shrunk on Saturday as they each won two contests. Cruz has been pushing to consolidate conservative support on the heels of those races, arguing Trump is not the candidate he claims to be.",
    " Title: Influential Church Figures Allegedly Push for Recognition of Homosexual Relationships at Upcoming Vatican Synod\n\nArticle:\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that a group of influential church figures, primarily from Germany and northern Europe, are making concerted efforts to steer the upcoming Vatican Synod on the Family towards accepting homosexual relationships. The synod, called by Pope Francis and attended by over 400 bishops and experts, is intended to explore pastoral applications of the church's teaching on marriage and the family. However, some fear that the meeting's purpose may be undermined by powerful lobbies with a hidden agenda.\n\nOn Monday, 50 participants, including nine bishops and over 20 liberal theologians, attended a secretive \"study-day\" at Rome's prestigious Gregorian Jesuit university. The meeting, which took place at the invitation of the heads of the German, Swiss, and French bishops' conferences, was criticized by some as promoting views with \"schismatic potential.\"\n\nCardinal Reinhard Marx, president of the German bishops and one of nine cardinals advising the Pope on church and Vatican reform, gave the meeting's closing address. Professor Manfred Spieker, a German church expert, wrote on the website Kathnet that the meeting was \"divisive\" and an abuse of the presidents' offices, as only those bishops sympathetic to the homosexual agenda were invited.\n\nGerman Cardinal Walter Kasper, whose theology Pope Francis admires, has publicly stated that the church needs to address the question of same-sex couples more fully and that the issue has become \"central\" since the last Synod on the Family in October 2014. He believes the church should honor long-lasting same-sex relationships.\n\nThe church's stance on homosexuality has been a contentious issue, with some faithful Catholics viewing the proposed approach as a surrender to secular values and a source of confusion. The church homosexual lobby, driven by ideology more than the well-being of homosexuals themselves, is unlikely to be deterred.\n\nOne of the tools the lobby is using to achieve its goal is the media. A large book, titled \"Who Am I to Judge?\", is set to be published by a German publishing house in September, just a month before the synod. The book, which calls for more acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle, is likely to stir debate and potentially influence the synod's discussions.\n\nPope Francis has warned of a homosexual lobby in the church, but his response to the issue remains unclear. Some faithful Catholics argue that his silence and inaction in the face of dissent are causing distress, while others feel that his popularity could have influenced the outcome of the recent Irish referendum on same-sex marriage had he spoken out more forcefully.\n\nAs the synod approaches, the church finds itself divided, with some bishops and theologians advocating for a more accepting stance on homosexuality, while others remain steadfast in upholding traditional teachings. The potential damage to the church and the souls of its followers could be significant, as the homosexual lobby continues to push for recognition and acceptance.",
    " Title: \"Obama and Romney in Deadlock as Election Day Approaches: A Look at the Final Stretch\"\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the clock ticks down to Election Day, both the Obama and Romney campaigns are making a final push to secure votes in a race that remains too close to call. According to top campaign advisers interviewed by The Wall Street Journal, President Obama's re-election strategy has been described as \"high risk, high reward.\"\n\nWith five days remaining, both campaigns can make a compelling argument for why they will have the edge on Tuesday. Team Obama argues that the tide has turned in favor of Mitt Romney, but not enough to carry him to an electoral victory in Ohio and the Rust Belt. A series of polls showing Romney falling just short in this region provides a powerful argument for the president's closing theory of the race.\n\nOn the other hand, Romney's advisers argue that a close race is good enough for the Republican nominee. They point to high voter intensity on the Republican side and a strong performance for the GOP nominee with several groups that were key to Obama's 2008 victory. The Romney theory is that they have the edge in a race that goes down to the wire.\n\nThe riskiest part of President Obama's re-election strategy was to spend so much of his campaign and his campaign's money on the attack. Knowing that voters remained unsatisfied with the status quo, Obamaland focused on disqualifying Mitt Romney, often to the detriment of making the president's own case. However, the latest polls show Romney and Obama tied on favorability, and both over 50 percent.\n\nIn the final five days, Obama will make a more positive closing argument, but he will do so in an atmosphere in which he and his challenger are both deemed plausible. The Obama Democrats have been suffering with an enthusiasm gap since the early days of the Obama era. The president's decision to move left after taking office and stay there hardened Republican opposition and boosted a traditional turnout advantage for the Red Team.\n\nThe Obama Democrats argued that superior resources and a community organizing approach to governance and campaigning would allow Obama to overwhelm the organic advantage of the Republicans. However, the Blue Team did not deliver.\n\nEarly voting is the best indicator we have for base enthusiasm. The weeks of early voting that now precede Election Day are the best chance for Democrats to win elections. This is not a time when undecided or even many persuadable voters go to the polls, but instead partisans show their ardor.\n\nThe latest Pew study and a slew of others show that what had been a huge advantage for Obama has been erased and maybe even reversed. In 2008, Obama led Republican nominee John McCain 52 percent to 34 percent among early voters in the Pew survey. Now, Romney leads 50 percent to 42 percent.\n\nDemocrats have long assumed that Romney would win among the votes cast on Election Day but were counting on early votes to carry Obama through. If the early vote in swing states is even close, it will be hard for Obama to win.\n\nRomney leads widely among the most passionate voters and Republicans have managed to match Democrats when it comes to contacting voters directly. Team Obama staked nearly as much on ground game superiority and getting out the vote as it did on the \"kill Mitt\" strategy. Again, the Blue Team did not deliver.\n\nIndependents are the most promising field of persuadable voters. Self-identified Democrats usually outnumber self-identified Republicans. Republicans therefore rely on the aforementioned turnout advantage combined with support from independents to win elections. That's certainly the case this year.\n\nIf the combination of organic enthusiasm and effective ground game for Republicans can offset the Democrats' numerical advantage, then it would be support from independents that could put Romney over the top. And in that measure, Romney is succeeding by a wide margin.\n\nIn the latest poll, Romney holds a 7-point lead among independent voters, with 16 percent on the fence or supporting a marginal candidate. Romney lost 2 points of his advantage with the group from the beginning of the month as the pool of undecided voters shrank from 25 percent. But it seems highly unlikely that the incumbent will get half of those remaining. Of those who consider themselves unaffiliated and undecided, the challenger, especially one with majority favorability and an equally matched voter outreach, has a clear advantage over the incumbent.\n\nIn conclusion, the race between President Obama and Mitt Romney is too close to call, and both candidates are making a final push to secure votes. The independent vote is the most promising field of persuadable voters, and Romney is currently leading among them by a wide margin. The final outcome of the election remains uncertain, but the race is shaping up to be a close one.",
    " Title: McConnell Adopts Aggressive Strategy for Reelection Bid in Kentucky\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of Kentucky, known as the Bluegrass State, the political landscape is heating up as Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican, gears up for a fierce reelection campaign. McConnell's strategy, reminiscent of recent efforts by Senate veterans like Harry Reid and John McCain, is being described as a'scorched-earth' approach.\n\nMcConnell, who has already invested nearly $200,000 in TV and radio ads, is leaving no stone unturned in his bid to retain his seat. He is assembling data streams to tailor messages for individual voters and has secured the support of almost every state GOP legislator. McConnell, who is certain to exceed the $21 million he spent in 2008, has made it clear that he intends to be aggressive from day one.\n\nThe political heat on McConnell has never been more intense. Tea party activists are displeased with some of his compromises over his three-decade career, and Democrats see an opportunity to flip the seat and challenge the opposition GOP leader. However, neither party has yet to field a challenger, and McConnell is not waiting for one.\n\nThe focus now shifts to Alison Lundergan Grimes, the 34-year-old Kentucky Secretary of State. If Grimes decides not to run, Democrats could be left without a top-tier candidate to challenge the GOP leader.\n\nMcConnell is walking a tightrope, appealing to the GOP base with policies like repealing Obamacare, while also highlighting his bipartisan deals that could attract middle-of-the-road voters. He is considering backing a gun control bill being drafted by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) as a Republican alternative to the Democratic legislation expanding background checks on firearm purchasers. However, he has expressed opposition to a more sweeping gun-control measure.\n\nOn spending, McConnell, who once touted the pet projects he brought home as a sign of his clout in Washington, now attacks President Barack Obama and the Democratic budget plans. Yet, he promotes his central role in drafting three controversial bipartisan deals with the White House: the year-end tax accord in 2010, the 2011 Budget Control Act, and the 2013 New Year's Day law to avert the fiscal cliff.\n\nAs the political landscape in Kentucky continues to evolve, McConnell's aggressive strategy is a clear indication of the intensity and stakes involved in this high-profile reelection bid.",
    " Title: White House Outlines Potential Consequences of Looming Spending Sequesters\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an attempt to build political pressure on Republicans, the White House has outlined the potential costs of the looming spending sequesters, detailing the impact on various government programs and the economy as a whole.\n\nThe White House has warned that the $85 billion in cuts, primarily in defense but also covering basic domestic spending, could result in the reduction of 70,000 youngsters from Head Start, a decrease in federal loans to small businesses, and a decrease in the number of food safety inspectors on the job.\n\nDavid Werfel, the federal controller for the White House's Office of Management and Budget, stated that the sequester, which is set to take effect every year for the rest of this decade, poses a serious threat to national security, domestic priorities, and the economy. He argued that the sequester does not represent a responsible way to achieve deficit reduction.\n\nUnder the 2011 debt deal, the automatic cuts are slated to take effect in exchange for Congress giving President Obama the authority to borrow more money. With all of that borrowing space used up, Mr. Obama wants to cancel the cuts and replace them with tax increases, arguing that the wealthy can afford to pay more in order to spend on priorities.\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner has stated that he wants to avoid the sequesters, and would prefer to cut other ways, though they reject tax hikes and any replacement must be alternative spending cuts. Defense-hawk Republicans also express concern over the deep cuts to the Pentagon, which the White House now says would total 8 percent on an annualized basis.\n\nHowever, many rank-and-file Republicans argue that the sequesters are the best deal the GOP can get at this point to actually see some spending cuts. This sentiment was boosted after the \"fiscal cliff\" agreement, which saw Republicans agree to $650 billion in new taxes over the next decade without any corresponding spending cuts.\n\nThe White House has detailed a series of specific cuts from the sequesters that it says would be too devastating to allow to happen. These include:\n\n* 600,000 women and children losing food stamps, which could also cost at least 1,600 state and local jobs due to reduced funding.\n* 100,000 formerly homeless people losing their government-financed housing.\n* Cuts to special-education money would eliminate federal support for 7,200 school employees around the country.\n* Job safety inspectors might have to be furloughed, which the White House warned \"would leave workers unprotected and could lead to an increase in worker fatality and injury rates.\"\n\nThe White House also laid out the broader negative consequences the sequester would have when it comes to the economy as a whole. Private forecasters, the Congressional Budget Office, and others have estimated that letting the sequester take hold would cost the country millions of jobs.\n\nIf Congress can't reach a deal, the White House urged lawmakers to delay the sequester by at least a three-month period to allow time to find targeted spending cuts, instead of an arbitrary across-the-board slash to all budgets, defense and domestic.\n\n\"The notion here is to delay these very severe impacts that I've described so that you have time to work out a deal that can delay and avoid them more permanently,\" said Jason Furman, the principal deputy director of the White House's National Economic Council.",
    " Title: Senate Hints at Revisiting Bipartisan Gun Background Checks Bill in 2021\n\nArticle:\n\nThe 113th Congress's debate over gun control and background checks continues, as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hinted on Tuesday that the Senate may vote on the bipartisan gun background checks bill again this year. The renewed push for the legislation comes in the wake of a mass shooting in Las Vegas, which left five people dead, including the shooter, and two police officers wounded.\n\nSenator Reid argued that the Senate's bipartisan background check legislation, which failed last spring, could have prevented the Las Vegas shooting, as the shooter was a felon and would not have been able to purchase a gun if he had undergone a background check. When asked whether the Senate would take up the legislation again, Reid replied, \"I wouldn't be surprised if we have another vote on it.\"\n\nSenator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), one of the bill's sponsors, said that Reid's message is that if the Senate can secure five more votes, enough to break a 60-vote threshold filibuster, the legislation will be reintroduced. However, Manchin admitted that he has not yet seen a count showing him closer to securing those additional votes.\n\nSenator John McCain of Arizona, one of the four Republicans who supported the Manchin-Toomey bill last year, said he would vote the same way if the legislation comes up again this year and expressed no qualms with Reid calling up the legislation again.\n\nThe shooting in Las Vegas appears to have reignited the gun control debate in the Senate's legislative agenda for the remainder of the year, after months of inactivity. On Monday, Reid stated that the \"American people are counting\" on the Senate to pass the bill, and when the White House tweeted about passing gun legislation on Tuesday, Reid's account tweeted back, \"Very few things that I deal with really cause me the heartache that this issue does.\"\n\nThe renewed push for gun control legislation comes as the Senate grapples with a number of other pressing issues, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, infrastructure, and the budget. It remains to be seen whether the Senate will be able to secure the necessary votes to pass the gun background checks bill this year.",
    " Title: House Speaker John Boehner Moves Toward Lawsuit Over Obama's Immigration Executive Actions, Raising Questions About Selective Legal Action\n\nArticle:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner announced on Tuesday that he is moving closer toward suing President Obama over his executive actions on immigration. According to National Journal, House Republicans will vote on a resolution that would allow Congress to join the existing lawsuit that 26 states have filed against Obama, or file its own lawsuit against the president. The lawsuit is expected to allege that the program President Obama announced last fall, which would grant protection from deportation to unauthorized immigrant parents of US citizens and permanent residents, goes beyond his legal authority.\n\nThe question arises as to why the new deferred-action program would be targeted, while the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which has been in place since 2012, is not included in the lawsuit. The DACA program, which has granted protection from deportation to about 600,000 unauthorized immigrants, follows the same model as the new deferred-action program: unauthorized immigrants who meet certain requirements will be able to apply for temporary protection, and have to renew that protection every few years.\n\nThe DACA program was not controversial when it was first announced, but has become politically controversial in retrospect, as Obama started contemplating and eventually took executive action to give relief to a broader set of unauthorized immigrants. The GOP did not sue Obama in 2012, or even in 2014, over the existing program.\n\nIf the lawsuit targets both programs, it raises questions about why Congress is only now taking legal action over something that's been going on for years, if it really thinks it's such a dire threat to the Constitution. This is relevant to the GOP's legal case, and it's relevant to the politics of the issue as well, since the DACA program was pretty broadly popular when it was rolled out. Polls are mixed on the new executive action, with Americans either favoring letting Obama's actions stand by a margin of 15 percentage points, or wanting it to be blocked, also by a margin of 15 percentage points, depending on how the question is asked.",
    " Title: The Dichotomy of Patriotism and Politics: A Critique on the Politicization of National Devotion\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the realm of American politics, the lines between patriotism and political rhetoric have become increasingly blurred, with recent presidents using their inaugurations as platforms to promote a 'national devotion' that borders on the cult-like. This article aims to examine the issue of politicians directing or defining patriotism and the potential consequences of such actions.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama's declaration of a 'National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation' during his first inauguration, and his call for a 'common purpose of remaking this nation for our new century,' was met with criticism. Similarly, President Donald Trump's proclamation of a 'National Day of Patriotic Devotion' and his assertion that 'a new national pride stirs the American soul and inspires the American heart,' has been seen as a continuation of this trend.\n\nThis self-aggrandizement, reminiscent of cults of personality rather than American republicanism, is a cause for concern. While it is not the author's intention to dictate how one should love their country, it is important to note that if one's devotion to America is contingent upon the party or the person in office, it may not align with the Founding Fathers' vision.\n\nThe politicization of inaugurations, treating them as coronations, is troubling. Furthermore, the conflation of patriotism with political ideologies or office is problematic. The eight-year tenure of a messianic presidency, with its finger-wagging and patriotism-appropriating administration, was a stark reminder of this issue.\n\nDuring Obama's administration, the call for 'economic patriotism' was met with criticism. Then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew's 2014 letter to Congress, echoing the president, advocated for a 'new sense of economic patriotism' that punished American companies trying to lower their tax burden. This is a far cry from the unalienable right of free expression.\n\nSimilarly, Trump's economic nationalism, as evidenced by his campaign rhetoric and the 'devotion executive order,' risks conflating patriotism with protectionist economic policies. The labeling of those who oppose such policies as seditious is a concerning development.\n\nThe distinction between patriotism and nationalism, as famously noted by George Orwell, is crucial. Patriotism, in the American sense, is a fidelity to a place and the Constitution, driven by idealism rather than chauvinism, ethnicity, or power. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power. The call for a 'new national pride' strongly hints at the latter.\n\nIt is possible to hate one's president and love one's country. It is possible to hope for a president's failure and still be patriotic. Presidents are politicians with agendas, and these agendas do not always align with the public's worldview. Let us avoid devotionals venerating political ascendency every four years.",
    " Title: Trump Tweets Doctored Biden Video Amidst Ongoing Allegations of Inappropriate Behavior\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, former Trump campaign staffer Alva Johnson accused Donald Trump of kissing her without her consent in 2016, making her the 16th woman to accuse the president of groping, kissing, or assaulting her. At least seven additional women have also accused Trump of sexual harassment. Trump's infamous remarks about groping women, revealed in the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, further corroborate these accounts.\n\nFast forward to Thursday, and Trump took to Twitter to share doctored footage of Joe Biden, intended to mock the former vice president for a video he shared the day before. In the original video, Biden addressed accusations of invading women's personal space by promising to be \"more mindful.\" In the tweeted video, Biden is shown grabbing himself on the shoulders and kissing himself on the head, mimicking the inappropriate behavior Biden is now addressing.\n\nTrump's decision to capitalize on accusations of inappropriate behavior, despite the numerous allegations against him, underscores the shamelessness of his administration. This is not an isolated incident; White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, during a Fox News interview last Sunday, dismissed Biden's behavior as \"creepy\" while ignoring the far more serious allegations against her boss.\n\nThe video Trump tweeted does not defend Biden. The video falls short of an apology for his behavior, and Biden's statement that \"social norms are changing\" seems to obfuscate the fact that at least two women \u2013 Lucy Flores and Amy Lappos \u2013 have accused him of inappropriate conduct at the time, not just in hindsight. If Biden decides to run in the first post-#MeToo presidential election, his treatment of women will be a significant issue he will have to address.\n\nHowever, Trump is not in a position to make a good-faith case against Biden. The purpose of Trump's tweet remains unclear, but one possibility is to derail Biden's potential candidacy before it officially begins. The vice president continues to outpoll the Democratic presidential candidates who are already officially running, and he currently outpolls Trump by anywhere between five and 13 points.\n\nAs the news continues to evolve, it is essential to stay informed.

Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, spoke at the Presidential Gun Sense Forum in Des Moines, Iowa, on August 10, 2019. The event was attended by Gage Skidmore.\n\nThe article explores the resurgence of socialist ideologies among young Americans, with a particular focus on Sen. Sanders and the progressive \"Squad\" of newly elected congresswomen, including Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib. The piece notes that about half of millennials would prefer to live in a socialist country, according to a recent Harris poll.\n\nThe article delves into the factors contributing to the growing appeal of socialism among young Americans. These factors include the burden of student loan debt, the allure of debt cancellation, the impact of asymmetrical globalization, and the concentration of young people in urban areas with limited job opportunities.\n\nThe article also discusses the role of education in shaping young people's political views. It suggests that the lack of unbiased teaching of economics, history, and politics in schools and colleges has led to a generation that is economically and historically illiterate, romanticizing figures like Che Guevara and Fidel Castro without understanding their bloody careers.\n\nThe article concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the historical and economic consequences of socialist regimes, and the role of education in shaping political views. It warns against the dangers of ignorance in shaping political ideologies, particularly among young Americans.",
    " Title: Trump's Response to Coronavirus: A Disconnect Between Assumptions and Actions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, President Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak has raised eyebrows among his supporters and critics alike. Given his history of emphasizing border security and his skepticism towards China, one might expect a more proactive approach from the President in the face of a foreign threat like the coronavirus. However, the President's initial response has been marked by downplaying the severity of the virus, despite its unknown risks.\n\nThe President's tone shifted in his Oval Office address, but many of his supporters have followed his initial lead, dismissing the threat of the coronavirus with arguments such as it being similar to the flu, only affecting the elderly, or that previous outbreaks like the swine flu were deadlier. This response, however, contradicts the populist nationalist stance that Trump and his supporters often espouse.\n\nThe coronavirus, originating in China, poses a significant threat to the United States, a country that Trump's supporters are wary of and want to be less reliant on. The virus, the borders, globalization, the federal bureaucracy, global supply chains, and the government's response are all factors that have played a role in the spread and potential impact of the virus.\n\nWhile there are honorable exceptions, such as Senator Tom Cotton and Tucker Carlson who have been vocal about the potential dangers from the beginning, many Trump supporters have resorted to denial rather than reacting to a threat that should be in their wheelhouse with tools congenial to them.\n\nBig events often carry a distinct ideological charge, and the coronavirus outbreak is no exception. The September 11 attacks had a strong conservative valence, while the financial crisis had a liberal one. The coronavirus outbreak, with its foreign origin and the need for a government response, could have been a natural populist nationalist issue. However, the response from Trump and his supporters has been lackluster, potentially discrediting their key assumptions rather than vindicating them.",

He expressed support for Democratic candidates, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Kamala Harris, and criticized Republicans, particularly Sen. Rob Portman, for their stance on gun control and school shootings.\n\nIn a tweet on the day of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, Betts questioned Sen. Portman's integrity, asking, \"Hey rob. How much did they pay you to look the other way? 17 kids are dead. If not now, when?\"\n\nBetts also expressed support for gun control, stating, \"This is America: Guns on every corner, guns in every house, no freedom but that to kill.\"\n\nIn addition to his political views, Betts' social media activity revealed a fascination with guns, but he also criticized the Republican party for school shootings. He made controversial statements about the 2017 Las Vegas shooting and the detention facilities at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAs of Sunday, Dayton police have yet to release a definitive motive for the shooting, but the information gathered from Betts' social media activity provides insight into his political and ideological beliefs.",
    " Title: Former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks Declines to Answer Questions in Closed-door Testimony\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closed-door hearing on Wednesday, former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks declined to answer a variety of questions related to her tenure in the White House during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This development was expected, as it was not entirely clear what the House Judiciary Committee was hoping to gain from Hicks' testimony, beyond a few quotes that could potentially be used for fundraising purposes.\n\nRep. David Cicilline (D-RI) expressed his frustration to NPR during a break in the hearing, stating, \"There's a whole bunch of lawyers in there. She's staffed up with many lawyers\u2014her own lawyers, White House counsel lawyers\u2014all there to make sure that she follows White House directions to not share information, to prevent Congress from conducting its oversight.\"\n\nHicks was the first senior administration official to agree to testify before the House committee about Mueller's investigation and President Trump's orders. President Trump criticized Democratic officials in Congress for putting Hicks \"through hell\" months after the Mueller report had already concluded. In a tweet on June 19, 2019, Trump questioned why former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deleted and acid-washed her emails after receiving a subpoena from Congress, stating, \"Anybody else would be in jail for that, yet the Dems refuse to even bring it up.\"\n\nRepublicans, including Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), criticized their Democratic colleagues for wasting taxpayer money and focusing on issues other than the immigration crisis. Collins stated, \"The Democrats can try to re-litigate the Mueller investigation, but they don't have the resources, and they're simply just having dramatic readings. This is not something we need to be doing when we have a border crisis, when we have other things going on... this is just another press release for the Democrats.\"\n\nHicks was originally subpoenaed by the committee, but after negotiations, she agreed to a closed-door testimony.

    " Title: Obama Faces Strategic Decision on Supreme Court Nominee as Republicans Vow to Block Confirmation Before Election\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, President Obama faces a strategic decision on his choice of replacement, as Senate Republicans have vowed to block any nomination before the fall's presidential elections. The new appointment could potentially shift the court's balance of power from conservative to liberal for the first time in decades, and Republicans have shown little indication of backing down from their stance.\n\nMark Hurwitz, a political scientist at Western Michigan University, stated, \"I don't see the Republicans just giving in and giving President Obama the opportunity to do that.\" The Constitution grants Obama the responsibility to nominate a replacement, but without the Senate's approval, he can only generate public pressure.\n\nDemocrats hope that Republicans will at least allow a hearing, even if they block Obama's nominee. However, the lack of a hearing is a possibility, as the political ramifications of filling Scalia's seat and the residual anger over the 2013 changes to filibuster rules for lower court federal judges could be significant obstacles.\n\nOne potential candidate for Scalia's seat is District of Columbia Circuit Court Judge Sri Srinavasan, who was confirmed by the Senate 97 to 0 in May 2013. Democrats believe that an unambiguous endorsement of Srinivasan could make it awkward for Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to block a vote on his nomination.\n\nRepublicans, however, may not be inclined to cooperate. The Washington Post reported that they are still fuming over the 2013 changes to filibuster rules, which allowed for the approval of lower court federal judges by a simple majority vote. Supreme Court justices still require a 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster.\n\nWith Obama having already made Democratic appointees the majority on nine of the nation's 13 circuit courts, Republicans are unlikely to give in on Scalia's replacement easily. This could lead Obama to nominate an overtly liberal candidate, using the political fallout from the stymied nomination to help drive voters to the polls in November.\n\nThe political maneuvering surrounding the nomination is significant, as the appointment is expected to have \"enormous consequences for constitutional law in the nation,\" affecting issues from campaign finance and affirmative action, to religious freedom and the Second Amendment, according to Jay Wexler, a professor at the Boston University School of Law.\n\nProfessor Hurwitz of Western Michigan University added, \"Republicans became very aware, particularly during the Reagan administration, how important judicial nominations were.\" With a presidential election looming, \"they smell the White House right now, and they don't want to lose this.\"",
    " Title: NBC News Announces \"Fifty Percent Challenge\" for Workforce Diversity\n\nArticle:\n\nNBC News, a subsidiary of NBCUniversal News Group, has announced a new initiative aimed at increasing diversity within its workforce. The initiative, known as the \"Fifty Percent Challenge,\" seeks to have 50 percent of its employees be women and 50 percent be people of color.\n\nIn an internal memo, NBCUniversal News Group Chairman Cesar Conde stated, \"As a news organization, we have a unique responsibility to reflect the country and all of the communities we serve.\" He further added, \"We aspire to achieve two concrete goals: that 50 percent of our News organization employees be women and 50 percent of our total workforce be people of color.\"\n\nCurrently, the company employs approximately 3,000 people, with news organizations including NBC News, MSNBC, and CNBC. As of now, women make up 50 percent of the organization's workforce, while people of color make up 27 percent.\n\nConde told the Los Angeles Times, \"We want to increase diversity and inclusion both in front of and behind the camera, and earn the trust of every community in America that relies on us for exceptional journalism.\" He acknowledged that this objective is ambitious and will require time to achieve.\n\nIn addition to diversifying the workforce, the chairman also mentioned that the company will focus on doing more long-form investigative pieces on issues that impact people of color.\n\nThis shift in focus comes amidst a wave of introspection and change within businesses and organizations across the country, sparked by the Black Lives Matter protests and the death of George Floyd.\n\nWhile the memo indicates a focus on diversity, some critics have raised concerns about the potential impact on the organization's journalistic integrity. The memo's emphasis on gender and ethnicity over resume and professional experiences has led to speculation about the future of current hosts such as Joe Scarborough, Rachel Maddow, and Chris Hayes. However, NBC News has not yet provided specific details about how the \"Fifty Percent Challenge\" will be implemented.",
    " Title: \"Rudy Giuliani Weighs in on Presidential Self-Pardon, Legal Experts Divided on Constitutionality\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an interview on ABC News' \"This Week,\" Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's confidante and lead attorney in the ongoing Russian investigation, was asked about a controversial topic: could a sitting president pardon himself?\n\nGiuliani, in a somewhat ambiguous response, stated that Trump \"probably\" has the power to pardon himself, but emphasized that the President has \"no intention\" of doing so. He further explained that the political ramifications of such an action would be challenging, stating, \"Pardoning other people is one thing. Pardoning yourself is another.\"\n\nThe question of a presidential self-pardon has sparked debate among legal experts. P.S. Ruckman, a political science professor at Rock Valley College in Rockford, Illinois, who runs a blog about presidential pardons, told Bloomberg News, \"Literally, yes. He could write his pardon down on a napkin and sign it\u2014that would be a pardon.\"\n\nHowever, other legal scholars argue that the issue is more complex. Alan Dershowitz, Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, Emeritus, wrote in an op-ed that the answer is \"crystal clear\" but \"Nobody knows!\" He cited James Madison's statement in the Federalist Papers that \"no person is allowed to be a judge in his own case.\" Dershowitz questioned whether a self-pardon would violate this principle and bestow jurisdiction on a court to invalidate the self-pardon.\n\nLaw professor Lawrence Tribe, in a Washington Post op-ed, noted that four days before Richard Nixon resigned, his own Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel used the same argument as reasoning for why an embattled president cannot pardon himself.\n\nPresident Trump has maintained his innocence in the Russian collusion \"witch hunt,\" and Mueller has not charged the President with any specific crimes, making the self-pardon question a hypothetical one at this time.",
    " Title: Biden's New York Trip Sparks Speculation of Presidential Run\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the political landscape, speculation has mounted over the possibility of Vice President Joe Biden entering the 2016 presidential race following his recent trip to New York last week. According to John Heilemann of Bloomberg, the Vice President met with a top Obama donor, Robert Wolf, gave a speech in support of a minimum wage hike, stood by Attorney General Loretta Lynch during an announcement of an $80 million effort to test rape kits more promptly, and had an emotional interview with Stephen Colbert.\n\nColumnist David Brooks, a Republican for The New York Times, believes this series of events has rekindled the prospects of a Biden candidacy. He suggests that the emotional interview with Stephen Colbert revealed a moving, compelling, and timely campaign narrative. The story, according to Brooks, is one of dual loss: the death of his wife and daughter decades ago and his son this year. Out of this loss, Brooks argues, comes a great empathy, a connection to those suffering in the economy, and a liberation from the fear of failure that plagues most politicians.\n\nRobert Wolf, a prolific fundraiser for President Obama in the past, confirmed that he met with Biden. The topics discussed during their meeting ranged from the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank to the nation's crumbling infrastructure. However, Wolf stated that Biden had not definitively declared his candidacy, and he himself is supporting Hillary Clinton.\n\nIf Biden does decide to run, securing the support of Robert Wolf would bring several benefits. As a significant fundraiser in Obama's past campaigns, Wolf could provide a substantial amount of campaign funds. Additionally, he could help Biden establish ties to Wall Street, an area where the Vice President has few connections. Wolf's expertise in economic matters could also prove valuable, as the priorities of the two align. Furthermore, Wolf's defection from the Clinton camp would be a significant symbolic blow to her already struggling campaign.\n\nHowever, Biden's potential entry into the race is not without its challenges. He has run twice before and lost both times, and his performance in New Hampshire has historically been poor. Additionally, competing with Hillary Clinton's high approval rating among black voters in South Carolina, a demographic Biden needs to appeal to, could be difficult. The question remains whether Biden has the \"emotional fuel\" to sustain a successful campaign.\n\nAs the political landscape continues to evolve, the possibility of a Biden presidential run remains a topic of much discussion and speculation. The Vice President's actions during his New York trip have certainly added fuel to the fire, but the ultimate decision lies with Biden himself.",
    " Title: Fact-Checking the Political Ads: Obama Campaign's Bain Attacks vs. Romney's Record\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing political discourse, the subjects of Bain Capital, Mitt Romney, and outsourcing have been under scrutiny, with President Obama's campaign facing accusations of repeatedly discredited claims. As Chicago unleashes another negative ad, Boston responds with a counter-ad. However, the new spot only lightly touches upon the core issue: the Obama campaign's ads are not just negative but also factually inaccurate, as pointed out by fact-checkers.\n\nDavid Brooks, in his portion of the ad, briefly discusses this issue. The Obama campaign has earned a series of \"Pinocchios\" for misleading, unfair, and untrue commercials based on \"no evidence.\" Despite this, the Obama campaign persists in their inaccuracies, yet they demand that Romney cease \"whining\" about being baselessly slandered as a felon or a liar.\n\nIn an interview with WAVY, Obama stated, \"We won't be apologizing... Mr. Romney claims that he's Mr. Fix-it for the economy because of his business experience. And so I think voters entirely legitimately want to know, well what exactly was that business experience?\" Chicago's former Mayor Rahm Emmanuel was more direct, stating on ABC's \"This Week\" program, \"Stop whining... If you want to claim Bain Capital as your calling card to the White House, then defend what happened at Bain Capital.\"\n\nThe issue is not about Romney's record at Bain being off-limits. Indeed, former President Bill Clinton has praised Romney for his \"sterling\" private sector career. What the Obama campaign is attempting to do is cherry-pick a few Bain flops that occurred after Romney left and attribute them to him. This does not provide voters with an accurate understanding of Romney's business experience. Instead, it provides them with false information that distorts Romney's record.\n\nYes, Romney should \"defend what happened at Bain Capital\" when he ran it. Obama's attacks make no such distinctions, leading to the poor reviews from fact-checkers. Furthermore, it seems that the Obama campaign's tactics mirror the criticism Democrats levied against John Kerry during the 2004 election, which was turned into a pejorative verb: \"Swiftboating.\"\n\nIn a report, John King revealed that four separate sources at Bain, including three Democrats, have confirmed what Romney has said (and what all the fact-checkers have found): Romney left Bain in February 1999, as he has asserted for over a decade. This confirmation comes in addition to the taxpayer-funded inquiry into this exact subject that Massachusetts Democrats convened in 2002. That commission's conclusion? Romney left Bain in 1999.\n\nThe Obama campaign's claims about Romney's involvement with Bain after 1999 appear to be unfounded, as evidenced by the weight of evidence suggesting that Romney did indeed end active management of Bain in 1999. The Obama campaign's assertions are questionable, and voters should be cautious when evaluating political ads during this election season.",
    " Title: U.S.-Iran Nuclear Deal: Obama and Netanyahu Lobby Congress as Israelis Express Skepticism and Iranians Celebrate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the historic nuclear deal reached in Vienna between the U.S., six world powers, and Iran, the focus has now shifted to Washington, D.C., as both President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seek to persuade Congress to either accept or reject the agreement that has already begun reshaping the Middle East landscape.\n\nPresident Obama, in his defense of the deal, stated, \"With this deal, we cut off every one of Iran's pathways to a nuclear program, a nuclear weapons program. And Iran's nuclear program will be under severe limits for many years.\"\n\nIn Israel, Netanyahu has embarked on a U.S. media blitz against the agreement. He argued, \"I think the inspection regime is full of holes because instead of having instant inspections, say within 24 hours, Iran has 24 days to open up suspect sites. Twenty-four days! Imagine giving a drug dealer 24 days' notice before you check the premises? This isn't going to work.\"\n\nIsraelis, who are on the front lines of the potential risks posed by the deal, are skeptical. According to a poll, 74% believe the deal will not prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. An Israeli man told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, \"It's a bad deal because sooner or later, it's going to reach us.\"\n\nAn Israeli woman expressed her concerns, stating, \"The world doesn't realize that the Islamic people, they want to take over the world.\" An Israeli man added, \"Iran is keeping on saying that Israel and the States and Europe have to be destroyed and everything has to be Islamic. So, they're going to continue to do everything.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Tehran, the people celebrated the deal. However, Iranian-born Middle East expert Menashe Amir expects Iran will cheat on the agreement, which could lead to an Iranian nuclear scientist community that could potentially enhance its nuclear program in the future.\n\nAmir told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News, \"The fact that the Iranian scientists have the permission to continue their research means that Iran will continue to find better ways of enhancing its nuclear program. After six years or eight years, they will begin in a very fast way to make the bomb.\"\n\nAs a result, Amir anticipates a Middle East nuclear arms race, with a potential united Arab force, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and other countries, cooperating to make nuclear bombs or seeking protection from Pakistan, the world's first Islamic nuclear power.\n\nFurthermore, some compare the $150 billion in sanctions relief to Iran, the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism, to a jihadist stimulus bill that could fan the flames of an already burning Middle East conflict.",
    " Title: Sessions' Changing Tune on Comey's Firing: A Look Back at His Previous Statements\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the justification for the dismissal of James Comey as the FBI director by President Trump is facing scrutiny, even from Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Sessions, who reportedly recommended the firing, has publicly defended actions he now cites as reasons for replacing Comey.\n\nThe memo penned by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein outlines the case for firing Comey, focusing on his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices during her tenure as Secretary of State. Rosenstein criticizes Comey for his press conference on July 5, 2016, where he explained why he was not recommending criminal charges against the Democratic presidential nominee. He also faults Comey for announcing, in a letter to members of Congress on October 28, 2016, the discovery of another email trove that might include evidence relevant to the Clinton investigation, just 11 days before the election.\n\nRosenstein's arguments, while compelling, are no stronger now than they were last July or last October, when Sessions rejected them. Yet, Sessions now claims Comey's behavior was so egregious that \"a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI\" to \"reaffirm its commitment to longstanding principles that ensure the integrity and fairness of federal investigations and prosecutions.\"\n\nTwo days after Comey's press conference, Sessions, then an Alabama senator and a leading Trump supporter, appeared on Greta Van Susteren's Fox News show. Sessions, a former U.S. attorney, said there seemed to be enough evidence for at least a misdemeanor charge against Clinton. However, he conceded that \"I have not studied the facts\" and described Comey as \"a skilled former prosecutor\" whom \"I have respected over the years.\"\n\nSessions gave no hint that he disapproved of Comey's press conference, which, as Rosenstein notes, broke with the FBI's usual practice of leaving prosecution decisions to the Justice Department and avoiding the release of derogatory information about people who have been investigated but do not face charges. To the contrary, when Van Susteren said she \"really appreciated [Comey's] transparency,\" since \"the American people wanted to know...what his opinion was and how he arrived at it,\" Sessions replied, \"It's not him that has the problem. It's Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nComey has argued that he needed to announce the outcome of the investigation because Attorney General Loretta Lynch had been compromised by her chumminess with the Clintons, as evidenced by a 20-minute conversation with Bill Clinton aboard her plane at a Phoenix airport on June 27, 2016. The criticism provoked by that \"regrettable\" meeting with the former president had prompted Lynch to announce that she would automatically follow the FBI's recommendations concerning charges against Clinton to avoid any appearance of bias. However, as Rosenstein notes, Comey could have asked Lynch to recuse herself from the case and let another Justice Department official announce the outcome rather than take on that task himself.\n\nSessions nevertheless endorsed Comey's defense of the press conference in an October 28, 2016, interview with Lou Dobbs on the Fox Business Network. \"I did not like the meeting that you mentioned on the airplane that put Comey in a position that he had to make this announcement,\" Sessions said. In the same interview, Sessions emphatically defended the other decision cited in Rosenstein's memo: \"He had an absolute duty, in my opinion, 11 days or not, to come forward with the new information that he has and let the American people know that.\"\n\nLast fall, Sessions said Comey \"had to make this announcement\" and \"had an absolute duty\" to follow up with his letter about newly discovered evidence shortly before the election. Now, Sessions says those are firing offenses. \"Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes,\" Rosenstein writes. But not Rosenstein's boss, at least not when those mistakes were helping the Trump campaign.",
    " Title: Four GOP States Consider Cancelling 2020 Primaries to Support President Trump\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could solidify President Donald Trump's grip on the Republican Party, four states are reportedly planning to cancel their 2020 Republican nominating contests. According to Politico, sources have revealed that South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, and Kansas are considering scrapping their primaries and caucuses.\n\nThe decision, if confirmed, would align with President Trump's efforts to consolidate power within the GOP at the state level. The report comes as President Trump faces primary challenges from former Rep. Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld.\n\nPolitico reached out to the state parties for comment, but has yet to receive a response. In statements to the outlet, state party officials in Kansas and Nevada suggested that the move is aimed at saving costs and using the funds for other races.\n\nNevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald stated, \"It would be malpractice on my part to waste money on a caucus to come to the inevitable conclusion that President Trump will be getting all our delegates in Charlotte. We should be spending those funds to get all our candidates across the finish line instead.\"\n\nKansas GOP Chairman Michael Kuckelman said in a separate statement that his party would have to spend an estimated $250,000 to hold their caucuses.\n\nIncumbent presidents' parties have canceled nominating processes in the past. The Arizona Democratic Party did not hold primaries in 2012 and 1996 when former Presidents Obama and Clinton, respectively, were running for reelection.\n\nSouth Carolina GOP Chairman Drew McKissick told Politico, \"As a general rule, when either party has an incumbent president in the White House, there\u2019s no rationale to hold a primary.\"\n\nThis development could potentially streamline the nomination process for President Trump, as he faces long-shot primary challenges from Walsh and Weld. The move, if confirmed, would also demonstrate the President's stronghold on the Republican Party ahead of the 2020 election.",
    " Title: German Police's Ethnic Profiling Strategy: A Controversial Approach to Crime Prevention\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an op-ed for Bloomberg, Leonid Bershidsky discusses the German police's new approach to crowd control, which involves a form of ethnic profiling, following the 2015 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Cologne. The strategy, which targets North African men, has been met with criticism, but Bershidsky argues that it is a pragmatic response to the disproportionate amount of crime committed by this group in Germany.\n\nThe strategy, technically classified as \"Caucasian\" profiling, has been effective in preventing a repeat of the 2015 incident, as Cologne police chief Juergen Mathies stated that the 2015 New Year's sexual attackers were predominantly North African men. Bershidsky writes that anyone crying \"Racism!\" betrays their own biases, as Mathies did not just allude to ethnicity but also to age and sex.\n\nProfessor Walter Williams defines profiling as a practice where people use an observable or known physical attribute as a proxy or estimator of some other unobservable or unknown attribute. Bershidsky argues that profiling is a common practice, and everyone engages in it, whether it be crossing the street to avoid a group of rough-looking youths, declining to pet a strange dog, or refusing to hire a babysitter with unconventional appearance.\n\nProfiling can be a valuable tool in making decisions based on scant information when the cost of obtaining more information is prohibitive. However, it can also be dangerous if not done properly. For example, doctors take race, ethnicity, and sex into account when evaluating patients, but this does not mean they are practicing discrimination.\n\nThe Israeli airport security's scrutiny of Muslims is not properly called prejudice but prudence, given that terrorism is almost exclusively an Islamic phenomenon. Similarly, the 83% of those stopped during the New York City's erstwhile stop-and-frisk program were from black and Hispanic groups, but this does not mean the program was racist.\n\nBershidsky argues that the real prejudice lies in the selective application of profiling. Fairness means that all overrepresented groups in a crime category should factor into a relevant profile. To say only some such groups will, while others receive a special dispensation from reality's slings and arrows, is discriminatory.\n\nSelwyn Duke, a conservative media personality, argues that \"racial profiling\" is a passion-stoking propaganda term, and there is basically no such thing. There is only good profiling and bad profiling. Good profiling considers many factors, such as age, sex, dress, behavior, religion, and, yes, ethnicity and race, in accordance with sound criminological science. Bad profiling is governed by politics and puerile priorities.\n\nBershidsky's op-ed raises important questions about the balance between individual rights and public safety, and the role of profiling in maintaining that balance. The debate over profiling is complex and nuanced, and it is essential to approach it with an open mind and a clear understanding of the facts.",
    " Title: Senate Republican Tax Reform Bill Faces Challenges as House Prepares to Vote\n\nArticle:\n\nCongressional Republicans are set to take their first significant step towards tax reform today, as the House of Representatives votes on their bill following a speech by President Trump on Capitol Hill. However, passing a tax bill in the Senate may prove more difficult, with at least one Republican senator already announcing his opposition to the bill as it currently stands.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) expressed optimism that the two chambers will be able to reach consensus before Christmas, stating that \"about 60-70 percent of the base policy I think we've already got common ground.\" Tillis also noted that changes to the bill, based on feedback from the business community and economic modeling, will likely be well-received.\n\nOne key difference between the House and Senate plans is the Senate's call for a one-year delay in phasing in the reduction of the corporate tax rate. This delay is intended to make the lower rate permanent under Senate rules. Despite the delay, Tillis asserts that businesses will still receive tax relief in the first year.\n\nTillis, who has experience reducing corporate tax rates in his home state of North Carolina, believes that such reductions can significantly boost economic growth. \"In North Carolina, we focused on reducing the corporate tax rate, and we went from one of the slowest-growing state economies to now one of the fastest-growing state economies,\" Tillis said.\n\nThe Senate bill also takes a step towards weakening the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, by repealing the individual mandate that requires people to purchase insurance or face a penalty. This move is supported by conservatives in both chambers.\n\nOn the House side, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy emphasized the pro-growth nature of the tax reform bill and its benefits for families and churches. \"It lets you put away for a future for your unborn child, which has never been done before in a tax code,\" McCarthy said. \"And also it protects the churches. So many times we had government telling us what we can say inside our churches, a lot of people know about the Johnson Amendment, this one takes care of that.\"\n\nThe Johnson Amendment, which forbids non-profit organizations, including churches and ministries, from supporting or opposing political candidates, is expected to be repealed in the final bill. Republican Sen. James Lankford is confident that the repeal will be included in the final bill in both chambers.\n\nHowever, the tax overhaul could face challenges, with Republican Sen. Ron Johnson announcing his opposition. GOP senators can only afford two \"no\" votes or the bill will not pass. Despite this, they remain optimistic that they will have a bill on the president's desk by the end of this year.",
    " Title: Biden Campaign Acknowledges Warren's Rise in Polls, Prepares for Potential Debate Challenges\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the 2020 Democratic presidential race heats up, Joe Biden's campaign team is not ignoring Elizabeth Warren's debating skills or her rising popularity, acknowledging her formidable standing in the race. However, they emphasize that they are not solely focusing on her.\n\nBiden, who served as Vice President under President Barack Obama, has faced criticism during the first two debates, a reflection of his current lead in the polls. His campaign is preparing for more criticism from various candidates in the upcoming debates.\n\nAllies of Biden argue that he has weathered rough debate performances in the past with minimal impact on his national poll numbers, demonstrating the enduring goodwill he enjoys from the Democratic base.\n\nThe campaign sees several opportunities for Biden to differentiate himself. This includes emphasizing his foreign policy credentials, given his tenure as Vice President and his previous role as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, amid several foreign policy controversies involving the Trump administration.\n\nBiden's team believes the Democratic electorate is more moderate than some activists suggest, and they welcome debates on issues such as healthcare and social programs. On healthcare, Biden supports a public option but opposes eliminating private insurance, a position that contrasts with Warren's \"Medicare for all\" plan.\n\nAllies are eager to strengthen an argument Biden has been making: that it is not enough to have ambitious plans if those proposals cannot survive the political realities of Washington.\n\nSenator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, highlighted Biden's experience in getting things enacted in a divided and partisan Washington. \"The difference,\" he said, \"is that Joe has decades of actual experience getting things enacted in a bitterly divided and partisan Washington, and I think he can and should point to that.\"\n\nWarren, who did not face significant scrutiny from other leading contenders in the first two debates, is expected to be a bigger target for attacks due to her current standing in the race. Biden's allies are hopeful that she will be pressed on the details and practicalities of her proposals by several candidates onstage.\n\nWarren and Biden have clashed before, most notably over the nation's bankruptcy laws, with Biden supporting and Warren opposing a bill that passed in 2005.\n\n[Subscribe to our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.]",
    " Title: California and Oregon Pave the Way for Over-the-Counter Birth Control Access\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move towards expanding women's health access, California and Oregon have become the first states in the nation to allow women to obtain birth control pills and other hormonal contraceptives directly from pharmacists without a doctor's prescription.\n\nCalifornia officials have been finalizing regulations on a state law passed in 2013, while Oregon's governor, Kate Brown, signed a similar bill into law last week. The measures have been welcomed by women's health advocates, who argue that the move removes barriers to women gaining access to birth control and other reproductive health care.\n\nKathy Kneer, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, expressed support for the new regulations, stating, \"We support efforts like these that remove barriers to women gaining access to birth control and other reproductive health care.\" She added that hormonal contraception has been widely studied and shown to be safe, making it suitable for over-the-counter availability.\n\nWhile the contraceptives won't be available like common over-the-counter items such as cough drops or antacids, in California, pharmacists can only dispense them after providing a health screening to women and taking their blood pressure. Oregon will also require a health screening, but the state's specific rules have not been developed yet.\n\nThe laws differ somewhat. California's law has no age restrictions on patients, with minors having the same access as adults. In Oregon, pharmacists may only give new birth control prescriptions to women 18 or older. Women under 18 must show proof of prior birth control prescriptions from a physician. Oregon is also expected to require pharmacists to undergo more training than the one hour of education required of California pharmacists.\n\nThe laws are expected to take effect on October 1 in California and January 1 in Oregon. Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues associate at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank, said other states could follow California's and Oregon's approaches, depending on how they work.\n\nThe new regulations come amidst partisan debate in Congress over access to birth control. While members of both parties support legislation allowing over-the-counter access, there is disagreement over insurance coverage. Democrats argue that Republican legislation would make hormonal contraceptives off-limits to many poor women by not requiring insurers to pay for over-the-counter hormonal contraceptives. They have introduced a bill that would require insurance coverage of over-the-counter hormonal contraceptives.\n\nCalifornia's regulations and Oregon's law do not address insurance coverage of birth control. However, California's pharmacists have voiced concerns that insurers may not pay for the time spent screening women and dispensing birth control, as they would for a doctor's visit.\n\nPharmacists in California are preparing for the new regulations and are hopeful of resolving the reimbursement issue. The expansion of pharmacists' prescribing authority is aimed at relieving the burden on physicians faced with an influx of patients newly insured under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPharmacists in California have been able to provide emergency contraception, also known as the \"morning-after pill,\" without a doctor's prescription. Most major pharmacy chains are expected to participate in offering non-prescription birth control, as they were involved in developing the protocols.\n\nSome patients have welcomed the change, expressing relief at the convenience it offers. Anne Wong, a 26-year-old resident of San Francisco, said, \"It's a drag to have to go to a clinic and talk to the doctor to get birth control pills \u2013 it takes a chunk out of your day.\" Wong, who emigrated from Thailand at the age of 17, believes the new access will help women in her community practice safer sex.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
    " Title: Trump Accuses China of Meddling in U.S. Midterm Elections, Denial from Chinese Foreign Minister\n\nArticle:\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events during a United Nations Security Council meeting, President Donald Trump accused China of meddling in the upcoming U.S. midterm elections to undermine his administration's tough trade policies. The allegation, which was made during a meeting dedicated to the problem of weapons proliferation, was met with a denial from Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\n\nDuring the meeting, President Trump stated that China is attempting to interfere in the U.S. elections, scheduled for November, due to their frustration with his administration's hardline approach towards Beijing in trade matters. Trump's comments marked a departure from the traditionally highly-scripted Security Council proceedings.\n\nLater in the same session, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, seemingly breaking from his prepared statement, denied the U.S. accusation of election meddling. He stated, \"We do not and will not interfere in any countries' domestic affairs.\"\n\nWhile Trump did not provide specific details during the Security Council session, he later indicated that he was referring to China's retaliatory tariffs against U.S. farm products, rather than the type of cyber-hacking that Russia conducted in the 2016 U.S. elections.\n\nIn a conference call arranged by the White House, a senior administration official stated that China is employing a \"whole-of-government approach\" to interfere in the U.S. democratic system, using political, economic, commercial, military, and informational tools. The official added that these activities have reached an unacceptable level.\n\nChina's tariffs, which have targeted U.S. farm exports, have particularly affected farmers in states and districts that voted for Trump. China also placed a four-page ad in the Des Moines Register last weekend, referring to the soybean dispute as \"the fruit of a president's folly.\"\n\nPresident Trump also used his role as this month's holder of the rotating Security Council presidency to issue fresh threats against Iran, stating that new U.S. sanctions against Tehran will be in place within weeks, and that additional, tougher sanctions are being prepared to curb its military programs and support for anti-U.S. proxy groups.\n\nHowever, Trump's criticism of the 2015 nuclear deal found little support during Wednesday's sessions, as European leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May joined Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in urging the deal's preservation. Iran was not represented at the morning session, but Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told a Wednesday press conference in New York that the U.S. pressure campaign was failing and even predicted that an isolated Washington would eventually rejoin the pact.\n\nTrump found virtually no support from the 15-nation Security Council to scrap the 2015 nuclear deal. Rouhani also stated, \"We do not wish to attack [the U.S.]. We do not wish to increase tensions.\"",
    " Title: Political Debate Erupts Over Comparison of U.S. Immigration Detention Centers to Concentration Camps\n\nArticle:\n\nA heated debate has ensued between Republican and Democratic lawmakers over the characterization of U.S. immigration detention centers along the southern border. The controversy stems from a statement made by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) during an Instagram Live session on Monday, in which she likened the facilities to concentration camps.\n\nOcasio-Cortez stated, \"That is exactly what they are: They are concentration camps. I want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say that 'never again' means something.\" She continued, \"I don't use those words lightly. I don't use those words to just throw bombs. I use that word because that is what an administration that creates concentration camps is. A presidency that creates concentration camps is fascist, and it's very difficult to say that because it is very difficult to accept the fact that that's how bad things happen.\"\n\nAs her comments gained traction in the media, Republicans accused Ocasio-Cortez of trivializing the suffering of Holocaust victims and survivors. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) tweeted Tuesday morning, \"You demean their memory and disgrace yourself with comments like this.\"\n\nIn response, Ocasio-Cortez questioned Cheney's stance on the use of \"mass camps of people detained without a trial.\" Cheney suggested that Ocasio-Cortez read testimonies from Holocaust survivors and Elie Wiesel's seminal memoir, Night. The exchange between the two representatives has since continued, with Ocasio-Cortez challenging Cheney to define her own perspective on the matter.\n\nThe back-and-forth echoes a similar exchange that occurred in November, when Ocasio-Cortez referenced past global refugee crises, including the Holocaust, to defend today's migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The debate has sparked a broader conversation about the treatment of immigrants and asylum seekers in the United States, with some arguing that the comparison to concentration camps is an appropriate description, while others maintain that it is an inappropriate and disrespectful comparison to the atrocities committed during the Holocaust.",
    " Title: Unemployment Rate Drops Slightly, but Long-Term Unemployment and Underemployment Remain High in November\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has reported a decrease in the unemployment rate from 7.9 percent to 7.7 percent in November, with total nonfarm payroll employment rising by 146,000. The employment increase was seen in sectors such as retail trade, professional and business services, and healthcare.\n\nDespite Hurricane Sandy making landfall on the Northeast coast on October 29th, causing severe damage in some states, the BLS reported that the storm did not have a significant impact on the new statistics. The BLS stated that their survey response rates in the affected states were within normal ranges, and their analysis suggests that Hurricane Sandy did not substantively impact the national employment and unemployment estimates for November. The regional and state estimates will be released on December 21st.\n\nWhile the unemployment rate has decreased, the number of unemployed people has remained the same, indicating that more people have simply stopped looking for work. The number of long-term unemployed people, those jobless for 27 weeks or more, also remains the same, accounting for 40.1 percent of the unemployed. The number of persons employed part-time for economic reasons, often referred to as involuntary part-time workers, was little changed over the month.\n\nYesterday, Gallup reported their seasonally adjusted numbers for November, putting the unemployment rate at 8.3 percent and underemployment at 17.2 percent. This suggests that while the unemployment rate has decreased, the overall employment situation in the United States remains challenging.",
    " Title: Report Reveals Release of Over 600 Criminal Immigrants by ICE in 2013 Ahead of Sequester Budget Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nA government watchdog report has revealed that more than 600 immigrants with criminal convictions were released by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in early 2013, in advance of the sequester budget cuts. The report, obtained by FoxNews.com, was released by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General on Tuesday.\n\nThe report found that ICE, in an attempt to address budget shortfalls, released 2,226 immigration detainees between February 9 and March 1, 2013. Of these, 629 had criminal convictions, some of whom were involved in serious offenses. The report indicated that many of these releases were problematic, as ICE leadership did not communicate effectively with the division in charge of detentions and did not inform higher-ups about the budget shortfalls.\n\nThe report, requested by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), found that ICE released \"criminal aliens\" from jails across the country as part of a wave of releases in February 2013. The agency came under fire at the time for the decision, which critics described as politically motivated and dangerous.\n\nThe report noted that many of the illegal immigrants were required by law to be held. Adding to the confusion, ICE leaders did not tell local field offices to track the releases. When they started asking questions, officers had trouble providing the information. In the end, while the agency found officers made \"reasonable release decisions\" given the time frame, they ended up redetaining dozens of those they had released.\n\nIn a written statement, ICE said the reductions in 2013 were \"necessary\" due to the \"high levels of detention at the time, coupled with the looming prospect of sequestration.\" The agency said it took \"careful steps to ensure public safety by focusing efforts to reduce the detained population on non-criminal, non-mandatory detention cases and cases involving individuals who posed no serious risk to community safety.\"\n\nThe report comes as the agency, along with other federal departments, grapples with the surge of illegal immigrant children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The IG report did note the constraints ICE is facing, as the agency is required by law to maintain an average daily population of 34,000 detainees, with funding coming from Congress and other sources. However, at the time, the report said, ICE was dealing with an average population of more than 35,000 detainees, facing budget cuts and other fiscal restraints, the agency decided to reduce the number of prisoners.",
    " Title: Economic Shifts and Political Alignment: The Impact of U.S.-China Trade on American Voting Tendencies\n\nArticle:\n\nA new research paper by four leading academic economists suggests that Americans are experiencing an \"ideological realignment\" in congressional districts most affected by competition from Chinese imports. As local manufacturing jobs disappear and economies struggle, voters are favoring either conservative Republicans or liberal Democrats over more centrist candidates.\n\nThe study, which cross-referenced voting records from the 2002 and 2010 congressional elections with district-by-district patterns of job losses and economic trends over the same period, found that in trade-exposed districts already held by Republicans, voters were \"substantially more likely\" to elect a conservative Republican. Conversely, trade-exposed districts with Democratic leaders were more likely to elect either a liberal Democrat or a conservative Republican.\n\nThe researchers attribute this trend, in part, to the \"China shock\" - the significant impact of China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, which led to a near 30% decrease in U.S. manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2010. Despite a slight recovery in U.S. manufacturing jobs to 12.3 million in 2015, many towns across the United States continue to struggle, with boarded-up storefronts, abandoned factories, and shrinking populations.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, this trend is evident in the unexpected runs of anti-establishment candidates such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Trump, a Republican contender, has rallied voters with his populist rhetoric and tough talk against globalization, pledging a 45% tariff on U.S. imports from China. Sanders, a Democratic candidate, has pledged to keep jobs in the U.S. by opposing free trade deals and supporting small businesses.\n\nThe divide has become particularly prominent among unionized workers, who are increasingly inclined to support Trump and his anti-trade rhetoric. Some Democrats and labor officials worry that Trump could capture a large segment of the union vote, historically a crucial part of the Democratic electoral coalition.\n\n\"Exposure to import competition is bad for centrists,\" Gordon Hanson, a professor at the University of California, San Diego and one of the authors, told the New York Times. \"We've now found a mechanism for how much economic changes create further political divisions.\"\n\nThis research sheds light on the complex relationship between economic shifts and political alignment, suggesting that economic changes can contribute to political polarization and further divide the American electorate.",
    " Title: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker Faces Legal Scrutiny Amidst Presidential Ambitions\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing investigation into Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's campaign activities has become a significant hurdle in his presidential aspirations, as he navigates the complexities of a John Doe probe that alleges illegal campaign coordination. The investigation, which began in 2012, has been a source of controversy and has raised questions about Walker's political integrity.\n\nWalker, a Republican governor known for his conservative policies and his battles against teachers unions and liberal activists, has been under investigation for possible illegal campaign coordination between his campaign and certain special interest groups. The investigation, which is similar to a grand jury investigation but conducted under strict secrecy orders, has been a topic of debate in political circles, with some viewing it as an attack on free speech while others see it as a necessary examination of campaign finance laws.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial page has been vocal in its support of Walker, casting the investigation as a partisan witch hunt. However, a recent development in the case has caused concern among Walker's allies. A conservative group, the Wisconsin Club for Growth, has sought to block prosecutors from having settlement talks with Walker's campaign, raising questions about the governor's commitment to the cause.\n\nThe development has sparked criticism from the Wall Street Journal, which has been a staunch supporter of Walker. In an editorial, the Journal expressed concern that Walker might be compromising the cause for short-term re-election reassurance. The editorial stated, \"Walker is a hero to many for his fight against public unions, but he will tarnish that image if he sells out the cause for some short-term re-election reassurance.\"\n\nThe legal civil war has put Walker in a difficult position. He is under pressure to put the political scandal behind him to focus on his presidential ambitions, but his backers expect him to fight the investigation to the end, risking potential legal consequences. The development has raised questions about Walker's commitment to his backers, particularly the big money right-wing groups like Club for Growth and American Crossroads, who have been generous contributors to his campaign.\n\nAs the investigation continues, Walker faces a critical decision: will he prioritize his presidential aspirations or fight the investigation to the end, risking potential legal consequences but demonstrating his commitment to his backers? The outcome of this legal battle could significantly impact Walker's political future.",
    " Title: Midterm Elections: Democrats and Republicans Express Confidence Ahead of Tight Senate Races\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, both the Democratic and Republican parties have expressed confidence in their chances of retaining or gaining control of the Senate. The polls show a slight advantage for Republican candidates in top Senate races, raising hopes among Republicans of gaining six seats and full control of Congress. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is optimistic that the Democrats' ground game, focus on economic issues, and quality of candidates will help them retain a Senate majority.\n\nSchumer told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the Democrats' on-the-ground efforts are so strong that they should \"add 2 to 3 points\" to their candidate's side in each race. He expressed confidence that the Democrats will keep the Senate, despite the pundits' predictions.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, argue that voter intensity is on their side. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) pointed to early voting in Iowa as evidence, stating that it has never happened before and that the polls show this will be a good year for the Republicans.\n\nThe Republicans' strategy for the Senate races involves linking Democratic incumbents and challengers to President Obama, who polls poorly in key red states with seats in flux. Senator Joe Manchin III (D-WV) argued that these people have voted against the president on issues, and that they should not be associated with him.\n\nBoth parties have expressed support for their respective leaders, despite some waffling among party colleagues on the campaign trail. Schumer backed Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), while Portman endorsed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nThe support for McConnell contrasts sharply with endorsements for his Democratic opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, in a pair of Kentucky's top newspapers. The Lexington Herald-Leader's editorial board was particularly scathing in their criticism of McConnell.\n\nDespite the criticism, McConnell can find solace in some of the latest polls, with figures from the CBS News/New York Times Upshot/YouGov Battleground Tracker showing him up by 6 percentage points. The midterm elections are set to take place on November 6.",
    " Title: The Role of Right-Wing Media in the Obama Administration's Approach to Race Relations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the ongoing crisis in Ferguson, Missouri, the call for President Barack Obama to take a more active role in addressing the issue of race relations has been a recurring theme in media commentary. However, a closer examination of the right-wing media's influence on the Obama administration's approach to race reveals a more complex picture.\n\nThe recent pleas for Obama to engage more forcefully in the Ferguson crisis, such as the demand for a national address on race, overlook the corrosive role of right-wing media in America. Over the course of Obama's two terms, the right-wing media has consistently tried to silence and intimidate the president on the topic of race, employing offensive and guttural rhetoric to do so.\n\nThe Beltway press, for the most part, has remained silent about the race-baiting that has become mainstream in conservative media commentary. This silence has allowed the right-wing media to inflict tangible damage on public debate and the chance for open dialogue.\n\nThe right-wing media's attempts to implement a heckler's veto on Obama, effectively shouting him down, have been evident in numerous instances. For example, during Obama's first term, his response to the arrest of Henry Louis Gates was met with accusations of racism from Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, and Rupert Murdoch. In 2012, after the killing of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, Obama's comments were met with naked race-baiting from conservative media outlets.\n\nEven Obama's carefully balanced statements on the situation in Ferguson have drawn fire from right-wing media figures such as Sean Hannity and The Daily Caller, who have accused the president of political ploys and timing his condolences to increase African-American turnout in the midterm elections.\n\nThe conservative flank of American politics has made it clear that it does not want to have a discussion about race or racism. The right-wing media's unapologetic attacks on the president, labeling him as un-American, disloyal, and a race-baiter, demonstrate their unwillingness to engage in a national conversation about race.\n\nIn light of this history, it is understandable that Obama may hesitate to aggressively insert himself into the Ferguson story, as doing so would likely invite a right-wing media hurricane that could overshadow the pressing issue at hand. The dark force of right-wing media hate and irrational Obama loathing should not be ignored in any analysis of the Obama administration's approach to race relations.",
    " Title: U.S. Lawmakers Urge Caution as Obama Administration Weighs Military Response to Alleged Syrian Chemical Weapons Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the Obama administration considers a strong response to the reported use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, U.S. lawmakers have cautioned the president to seek Congressional authorization before taking any full-scale military action.\n\nSen. Bob Corker (R-TN), the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that he believes the president will respond soon with military action, but suggested waiting until Congress returns next week to seek its authorization. Corker urged a \"surgical\" response that would not move the U.S. away from its current policy of supporting the Syrian opposition group on the ground.\n\nNew York Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also called for a U.S. response, but urged cooperation with NATO allies. \"We have to move, and we have to move now,\" Engel said.\n\nTheir comments come after almost a year of lawmakers pressing Obama to make good on his statement about Syria \"crossing a red line\" by using chemical weapons. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel suggested on Friday that the Pentagon might move naval forces closer to Syria in preparation for a possible decision by Obama to order military strikes.\n\nHowever, U.S. defense officials have said the Navy has already sent a fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and lawmakers suggest that using cruise missiles fired from offshore may be the best strategy.\n\nRhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, a member of the Armed Services Committee, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that the U.S. cannot let itself get into a situation in Syria \"where this becomes a springboard for a general military option.\"\n\nThe White House has been reluctant to take direct military action, instead supplying rebel forces with non-lethal aid, weighing military options, and trying to garner international support. The administration official said on Sunday that the U.S. intelligence community made the assessment about likely chemical use based on the reported number of victims, reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, and witness accounts.\n\nThe White House also thinks Assad and his forces originally denied United Nations investigators immediate access to the site of the reported attack to give the evidence time to degrade, and any inspection now will be too late, the official said. The administration's statement follows a meeting Saturday between President Obama and his National Security Council that concluded with the White House saying the administration was still \"gathering facts.\"\n\nSyrian state media accused rebels of using chemical arms against government troops in clashes on Saturday near Damascus, while Doctors Without Borders said it has tallied 355 deaths from the purported chemical weapons attack on Wednesday. The international aid group said three hospitals it supports in the eastern Damascus region reported receiving roughly 3,600 patients with \"neurotoxic symptoms\" over less than three hours on Wednesday morning when the attack in the eastern Ghouta area took place.",
    " Title: Trump's Aggressive Approach Towards U.S. Media Raises Questions About His Ability to Handle International Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nThe recent combative behavior displayed by Donald Trump towards American media during a press conference has sparked concerns about his ability to handle personal challenges from world leaders. If Trump, who has shown signs of losing his cool in response to domestic media, cannot handle scrutiny from ABC or The Washington Post, how could he stand up to Vladimir Putin or other world leaders?\n\nDuring the press conference, Trump attacked reporters for pressing him on his promises of charitable aid to veterans' groups. He called one ABC reporter a \"sleaze\" and complained that the press was not giving him credit for being generous. Trump's anger was focused on a controversy that arose in January when he claimed to have raised $6 million for veterans, but investigations revealed that the actual amount was far less and that Trump himself had not donated anything.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump outlined the donations, stating that his foundation had made many of them, including his own $1 million gift, after the controversy arose. Trump continued to berate the media throughout the press conference.\n\nThe incident raises questions about Trump's ability to handle personal challenges from foreign leaders. Personal relationships are a significant part of geopolitics, and handling them is one of the most important aspects of the presidency. The personality of the person sitting in the Oval Office comes into play, as demonstrated by the blustery Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev hectoring new US President John Kennedy in Vienna in 1961.\n\nTrump's campaign spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, stated that Trump would not behave towards foreign leaders as he did towards US reporters. She explained that Trump would not talk to a roomful of colleagues that way \"because they are not treating him the way the media is doing today.\"\n\nHowever, foreign adversaries can be much rougher than domestic media, and Trump's problem with foreign leaders is not rooted in belligerence as much as in credulity, according to one critic. Trump seems easy to flatter, as demonstrated by his admiration for North Korea's dictator Kim Jong-un.\n\nThe Clinton campaign is eager to bolster the image of Trump as an unstable entity. Clinton's use of the issue to pivot away from questions about the propriety and legality of her use of a private e-mail server as secretary of State highlights the concern that Trump's unpredictable behavior could pose a threat to national security.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's aggressive approach towards the American media has raised questions about his ability to handle personal challenges from world leaders. The personality and demeanor of the President are crucial factors in geopolitics, and Trump's behavior towards the media suggests that he may struggle to handle the personal challenges that come with the presidency.",
    " Title: Trump Explores National Emergency Declaration to Secure Funding for Border Wall Amid Government Shutdown\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the partial government shutdown enters its third week, the White House is exploring various options to secure funding for the construction of a barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border, including the use of the president's emergency powers to bypass Congress altogether.\n\n\"We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly,\" President Donald Trump said Friday. \"But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we are giving that a shot.\" The president repeated this assertion Sunday, and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Trump had directed \"every single Cabinet secretary and the Office of Management and Budget to go out and find money that can be used legally to guard the southern border.\"\n\n\"Presidents have authority to defend the nation,\" Mulvaney added, stating that he was personally involved in the hunt to find funds that could be steered toward a border wall.\n\nThe government shutdown is tied for third longest on record, with no end in sight. The question on the border wall is: Does the president have the authority to declare a national emergency and direct resources to the border?\n\n\"Trump can surely test whether he has the power to declare a national emergency for this purpose,\" said Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor at Princeton University's Center for Human Values. \"The National Emergencies Act allows him to declare a state of emergency without approval from anyone else, but then he has to stay within congressionally delegated emergency powers after that.\"\n\nThe 1976 National Emergencies Act was passed in the post-Watergate, post-Vietnam era to create more structured procedures for the president's use of emergency powers. Under that law, the president must cite the specific emergency powers he is activating under existing statutes. According to the Congressional Research Service, there are hundreds of \"provisions of federal law delegating to the executive extraordinary authority in time of national emergency.\"\n\nOne potential avenue for the president to declare a national emergency could be under the Immigration and Nationality Act. An immigration emergency is defined as an \"influx of aliens which either is of such magnitude or exhibits such other characteristics that effective administration of the immigration laws of the United States is beyond the existing capabilities\" of immigration authorities \"in the affected area or areas.\"\n\nAnother option could be under laws regarding military spending, which say the secretary of defense can undertake construction projects during a national emergency without authorization. The law states that those projects must be \"necessary to support such use of the armed forces.\" The law also permits the Army\u2019s civil works program to build structures necessary for the national defense after the president declares an emergency. The secretary of defense may also reprogram money that had been set aside for military construction projects.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called Trump's invocation of his emergency powers \"really threatening talk\" that \"he doesn't have the power to execute.\"\n\n\"If Harry Truman couldn't nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this president doesn't have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border,\" Schiff told CNN.\n\nHowever, some argue that Trump does have the authority to declare a national emergency but would face legal challenges.\n\n\"There is a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency. It's been done a number of times,\" said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington. \"In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, where is the emergency? You have to establish that in order to do this.\"",
    " Title: House Republicans Criticize Obama Administration's Handling of Bergdahl Incident, Alleging Lack of Congressional Involvement\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a closed-door briefing on Monday, top national security officials provided House lawmakers with an opportunity to assess the Obama administration's decision to trade five Taliban detainees for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. The meeting, which lasted over an hour, saw House Republicans expressing dissatisfaction, claiming they learned little new information about the incident that hasn't already been disclosed in the media.\n\nGOP lawmakers were particularly upset about the estimated 80 to 90 executive branch officials from the Pentagon, White House, and intelligence agencies who were informed beforehand, while no members of Congress were briefed. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) stated, \"It strikes me as unfortunate that they could have 80 to 90 people in the administration and not be able to trust a single Republican or Democrat in the House or the Senate.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has publicly stated that he was informed the day before the Bergdahl exchange, but administration officials now claim that was not the case. The conflicting public viewpoints are rare between the administration and its chief partner on Capitol Hill.\n\nDuring the briefing, lawmakers were shown a \"proof of life\" video of Bergdahl from January, made by his Taliban captors. Bergdahl reportedly told American military officials that he was held in a cage in total darkness for weeks at a time.\n\nWhile expressing sympathy for Bergdahl and his family, Republican lawmakers criticized the swap as improper and possibly illegal, as President Barack Obama was supposed to consult with Congress 30 days before making such a move. Some administration officials have privately claimed that if word of the U.S.-Taliban talks leaked, Bergdahl's life would have been in jeopardy.\n\nRank-and-file Republicans were frustrated by what they see as more stonewalling by the Obama administration as the White House tries to navigate yet another controversy. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) stated, \"They [administration officials] made abundantly clear from the stage that we received no classified information.\"\n\nSome Democrats sought to defend the White House handling of the Bergdahl incident, stating they understood why the administration wouldn't share information with Capitol Hill about such a sensitive matter. However, the lack of congressional involvement remains a point of contention for many Republican lawmakers.",
    " Title: Democrats' Senate Majority Dreams Dim as Key Races Shift Toward Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, the Democrats' hopes of flipping the Senate have taken a significant blow over the past month, with their candidates faltering in key races. The party now faces an increasingly small battleground, with only one Republican-held seat, in Arizona, considered a 50-50 bet. Three other targets\u2014in Texas, Nevada, and Tennessee\u2014have shifted toward the Republican Party following the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nJames Henson, a pollster with Strategic Research Associates LLC, stated, \"The short interval in which there seemed to be some kind of possibility that Democrats could rally in the Senate was probably ill-fated to begin with, and we see less suggestion of that as we get closer to Election Day.\" He added, \"Have the Democrats' hope of a majority in the Senate, have they dimmed? Yes, full stop.\"\n\nThe Democrats' prospects are better in the House, where most analysts predict they will win at least the 23 seats needed to flip control. The key House races are playing out in territory less friendly to President Trump, with more than two-thirds of the seats up for re-election held by Democrats.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, expressed optimism about turnout but declined to make any predictions. \"I am optimistic that we are going to see a big turnout,\" Mr. Van Hollen said Thursday at a forum sponsored by The Washington Post. \"I am not going to make any predictions for this reason. It entirely depends on turnout.\"\n\nThe biggest hurdle to the Democrats' hopes is North Dakota, where Sen. Heidi Heitkamp trails her Republican challenger, Rep. Kevin Cramer, by 16 points, according to a poll this week. Mark P. Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston, said the results showed another sign that the Kavanaugh battle had accelerated the typical partisan tendencies of voters who tune in late in the electoral season.\n\nIn Texas, Rep. Beto O'Rourke outperformed early expectations, but most polling shows him with a small but persistent disadvantage against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, raising questions about how many more supporters he can find in the Republican-dominated state.\n\nThe good news for Democrats is that they appear poised to defend Senate seats in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Sen. Joe Manchin III is also well-positioned to win re-election in West Virginia.\n\nHowever, incumbents are in tight races in Indiana, Florida, Missouri, and Montana. In Missouri, Sen. Claire McCaskill's re-election race against state Attorney General Josh Hawley is so close that she started running a radio ad in which a supporter assures listeners she is \"not one of those crazy Democrats.\"\n\nThe race for the open seat in Arizona between Reps. Kyrsten Sinema and Martha McSally is still considered a toss-up. Ms. Sinema, the Democrat, needs to win an overwhelming percentage of independents and see a massive Democratic turnout to counter Arizona's Republican registration advantage.\n\nMike Noble, a pollster with OH Predictive Insights, said early voting totals instead mirror historic midterm turnout levels in the state, which would give Republicans a double-digit edge. \"Here in Arizona, we are currently not seeing the effect of the blue wave as many have been speculating,\" Mr. Noble said.\n\nPrognosticators also see the Nevada contest between Sen. Dean Heller and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Jacky Rosen, as a toss-up, though the latest three polls this month all showed the Republican with a lead. Early voting in Nevada could bode well for Ms. Rosen, but the Clark County Republican Party chairman, Carl Bunce, had a different take. \"The current turnout indicates no blue wave of any kind unless Democrats turn out in higher numbers than Republicans on Election Day, which would be against precedent,\" Mr. Bunce said.",
    " Title: New Jersey Senator Cory Booker Officially Enters 2020 Presidential Race\n\nIn a move that adds another contender to the growing list of Democratic candidates vying for the White House in 2020, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker officially announced his presidential bid on Friday. The announcement was made in an email to supporters, promising to \"channel our common pain back into our common purpose.\"\n\nBooker, who first rose to prominence as the mayor of Newark, launched his campaign with a video that recounted the racial discrimination faced by his family and emphasized the power of civil rights movements. The video was accompanied by a tweet, \"I\u2019m running for president. Join me on this journey.\"\n\nThe senator, who was elected to the Senate in 2013, made his announcement on the first day of February, which is designated as Black History Month. Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) is the second black candidate in the race, following California Senator Kamala Harris, who announced her run on Martin Luther King Day.\n\nBooker plans to travel to the first caucus state of Iowa the weekend of February 9, followed by early battleground states South Carolina and New Hampshire over the following week, according to his campaign. Like some of the other Democratic contenders, Booker has said he will not accept campaign donations from corporate political action committees and lobbyists.\n\nSince his arrival in the Senate, Booker has been widely viewed as a potential contender for president and was a finalist for Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential nominee in 2016. Branding himself as a progressive, Booker has embraced a 'Green New Deal' and supports Medicare-for-All health insurance provisions, comprehensive immigration reform, and criminal justice reform efforts.\n\nHowever, Booker has faced criticism from left-wingers for his strong ties to Wall Street firms and the pharmaceutical industry. A member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Booker is known for his fiery questioning of nominees and administration officials in the age of Trump.\n\nIn a memorable moment, Booker lashed out at Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen over reports that President Trump questioned the need to accept immigrants from \"shithole countries.\" Booker, who is fluent in Spanish, took part in call-in interviews with radio shows popular with African American and Latinx listeners on Friday morning. Later in the day, he will be interviewed on the popular daytime chat show The View, which has a majority female viewership. His mother will be sitting in the studio audience.",
    " Title: A Comparative Analysis of the U.S. Healthcare System and Other Industrialized Countries: The Quest for Universal Coverage and Cost Control\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United States, with its unique blend of private and government-funded health insurance plans, is grappling with the ongoing debate over the role of government in its healthcare delivery system. Half of all Americans receive their health insurance through their employer or their spouse's employer, while over 40 percent receive it from the government. The remaining portion is either uninsured or obtains health insurance through the private individual market.\n\nThe U.S. spends significantly more per person on healthcare than other industrialized countries, with overall medical spending totaling $3.5 trillion or 18 percent of the national gross domestic product last year. This high expenditure has led to a search for solutions in other countries, but the applicability of their models may be limited due to their smaller size and more homogenous populations.\n\nA Forbes survey reveals that the U.S. accounts for 38 percent of life-saving and life-extending medical innovations, compared to an average of 15 percent in other countries. The U.S. also leads the world in pharmaceutical research and development. However, in all other industrialized countries, the demand for healthcare often exceeds the budgeted funds, leading to chronic shortages and strict rationing.\n\nCountries like Canada and Great Britain, with their nationalized and comprehensive government health-care systems, face long wait times for specialized care. For instance, in 2018, wait times for specialty care in Canada averaged 20 weeks, with 250,000 citizens waiting more than six months for planned treatments within the National Health Service over the past year.\n\nWhile universal health insurance coverage is a desirable goal, the key is finding the best mechanism to provide the most Americans with timely access to healthcare. The American experience with the Veterans Administration hospital system, a comprehensive, government-controlled, single-payer health-care program, demonstrates unacceptable wait times and inefficiencies.\n\nThe U.S. stands out for its broader use of free markets, which offers the best solution to provide the greatest access to healthcare and control costs. Allowing Americans to make their own healthcare decisions and use their own healthcare dollars would give them the best chance to access healthcare. Eliminating third-party payers, greater use of health savings accounts, price transparency, and health insurance reform would put patients, rather than the government, in charge of their own healthcare.\n\nDr. Stark, Health Care Policy Analyst for Washington Policy Center, emphasizes this approach. The U.S. healthcare system, with its unique blend of private and public sectors, offers a complex yet dynamic landscape for reform, one that prioritizes patient choice and cost control.",
    " Title: Analysis: Chris Christie's Bridge Scandal and the Enduring Image of a Bully\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the George Washington Bridge scandal, former Clinton advisor Paul Begala has weighed in on the political implications for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Begala suggests that Christie's attempt to distance himself from the bullying narrative may not be successful, as the scandal aligns with pre-existing perceptions of him as a bully.\n\nBegala argues that Christie's claim of innocence is not convincing, as he is not convincingly portraying himself as a victim. He points out that Christie's assertion that he believed his staff's explanation for the traffic disruption is implausible, given his background as a former federal prosecutor and his one-hour \"investigation\" of the operation.\n\nThe scandal, according to Begala, is likely to persist due to three key factors. First, it reinforces a pre-existing narrative that fits with Christie's negative master narrative as a bully. Second, there are ongoing legal and political processes, including subpoenas and potential lawsuits, which may reveal more information about the scandal. Third, the scandal's location in the media epicenter of the East Coast, particularly New York, has increased its visibility and impact.\n\nBegala concludes that Christie's attempts to deflect blame and apologize will not be effective in resolving the issue. He suggests that the scandal is unlikely to fade away anytime soon, and may ultimately contribute to Christie's political downfall.",
    " Title: Congress Faces Impasse in Homeland Security Funding Showdown as Deadline Looms\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the deadline for a funding extension for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) approaches, lawmakers return to the Capitol without a clear resolution to the ongoing standoff over homeland security funds. The impasse remains as Senate Democrats refuse to negotiate on the issue and House Republicans are determined to block President Obama's immigration amnesty.\n\nCongress managed to buy a weeklong reprieve by passing a last-minute funding extension to avoid a shutdown last weekend. However, the new Friday deadline has not altered the impasse. After a rebellion by rank-and-file House Republicans against their leaders' strategy last week, Speaker John A. Boehner stated on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that his troops were united in the fight to defund Mr. Obama's immigration actions, if not on the tactics.\n\nThe Ohio Republican pointed to the 38 times Mr. Obama unilaterally changed the Obamacare law, though it was Mr. Obama's immigration moves that led to the funding crisis for the DHS. \"The frustration in the country, represented through the frustration of our members, has people scared to death that the president is running the country right off the cliff,\" he said.\n\nHouse Republicans broke ranks over the leadership's plan to pass a three-week funding bill to prolong the fight and avoid a shutdown of the DHS. Enough GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to kill the bill in a surprising rebuke to Mr. Boehner. The Senate later sent a one-week funding measure that the House overwhelmingly approved just two hours before a midnight shutdown deadline.\n\n\"We do have some members who disagree from time to time over the tactics that we decide to employ,\" Mr. Boehner said. \"But remember that Republicans are united in this idea that the president has far exceeded his constitutional authority and we all want to do things to stop the president from his illicit activity.\"\n\nIndeed, House Republican leaders and rank-and-file conservatives were in rare agreement about not backing down. Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the conservative's newly formed Freedom Caucus, threw cold water on the inside-the-beltway chatter about the GOP getting ready to agree to Democrats' demands.\n\n\"That's not going to happen,\" the Ohio Republican said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Mr. Jordan said his party would instead redouble its effort to rally voters against Mr. Obama's actions, which seek to grant legal status, work permits, and Social Security numbers to more than 4 million illegal immigrants.\n\nWith a new deadline looming, House Republicans hope to push Senate Democrats into negotiations on a funding bill that includes anti-amnesty measures. However, Senate Democrats remain adamant that the House pass a \"clean\" bill. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that her party would never compromise on the immigration cause.\n\n\"We want a clean bill. We have passed, taken votes on a clean bill,\" she said. \"I see nothing else happening, other than a clean bill.\" Mrs. Feinstein blamed the stalemate on Republicans, who she referred to as a \"minority,\" despite the GOP having majority control of both the House and Senate.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, last week repeatedly vowed not to go to conference to reconcile the House-passed bill with anti-amnesty measures and the Senate-passed bill without policy riders. Senate Democrats will get to vote Monday on whether to allow a conference committee. They can block it by denying the 60 votes needed to consider forming the committee.\n\nSenate Republicans, who have a 54-seat majority, surrendered last week to demands for a clean bill in order to get Democrats to end their filibuster of the House-passed legislation. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested that Senate Republicans invoke the \"nuclear option\" of changing the chamber's rules to stop filibusters, a tactic Senate Democrats used to push through confirmation of Mr. Obama's nominees when they controlled the chamber.\n\nMr. McCarthy, California Republican, said the move would hardly be \"nuclear\" because the anti-amnesty measure had the support of 57 of the chamber's 100 senators. \"That is not nuclear when 57 percent of the American representation says it's wrong,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"That's not in the constitution. I think they should change the rules.\"",
    " Title: Congressional Republicans Face Challenges as They Return to Washington Amidst Town Hall Controversies and Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nAs Congressional Republicans return to Washington following a week-long recess, they are faced with a daunting to-do list and a contentious political climate. The return to the nation's capital comes after a week in which high-energy town halls featuring contentious exchanges with constituents dominated headlines.\n\nUpon their return, members of Congress are not expected to find much relief. The upcoming joint congressional address by President Donald Trump on Tuesday is likely to color their efforts, if not disrupt their work entirely.\n\nOne of the main tasks for the Republicans is the confirmation of President Trump's Cabinet members. Senators are expected to confirm Wilbur Ross as Commerce Secretary, as well as move forward on the nominations of Ryan Zinke at the Interior Department, Ben Carson at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Rick Perry at the Energy Department.\n\nIn addition to the Cabinet confirmations, Republicans are also hoping to move forward with repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. This seven-year promise has become even more endangered given the tense exchanges with constituents and internal schisms within the GOP over how to move forward. Public opinion is also turning, with two recent polls showing support for the current law at an all-time high.\n\nRepublicans need 50 senators to support their repeal package, but that means they can only afford to lose two lawmakers. Last week, Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski stated in an address to her state legislature that she would not support a plan that repeals Medicaid expansion available through Obamacare nor would she support defunding Planned Parenthood as part of repeal. This could be problematic if the final version of Obamacare repeal looks anything like a leaked draft released last week.\n\nAlabama Republican Rep. Mo Brooks conceded last week in a local radio interview that the town halls were so powerful they might stop repeal in its tracks. \"I'll tell you, Toni, there are in my opinion a significant number of congressmen who are being impacted by these kinds of protests and their spine is a little bit weak,\" Brooks said on \"The Morning Show with Toni & Gary\" on WBHP 800 Alabama radio. \"And I do not know if we're going to be able to repeal Obamacare now because these folks who support Obamacare are very active, they're putting pressure on congressmen and there's not a counter-effort to steel the spine of some of these congressmen in toss-up districts around the country.\"\n\nThe town hall pressure came in the form of organized chants of \"do your job\" or even \"ACA,\" as well as more thoughtful but challenging questions from individual voters. One such constituent asked Tennessee Republican Rep. Diane Black a detailed policy question before citing her Christian faith as her reason for supporting Obamacare. \"The healthy people pull up the sick people right?\" the woman said. \"As a Christian, my whole philosophy in life is pull up the less fortunate. The individual mandate, that's what it does.\"\n\nAt a town hall in Kentucky, a woman confronted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about the high numbers of people on food stamps in Kentucky, the lack of coal jobs, and the lack of health insurance. \"If you can answer any of that, I'll sit down and shut up like Elizabeth Warren,\" the woman said, referencing McConnell's recent use of Senate procedure to stop the Massachusetts Democrat from speaking on the Senate floor.\n\nAfter a rocky start, Trump is expected to focus his joint congressional address on policy goals, including health care and tax and regulatory reforms, as well as increased military spending. However, even though Republicans finally have an ally in the White House to enact their party's agenda, Trump has proven he can be as much a hindrance as a help.\n\n\"In many respects, this administration is in disarray, and they've got a lot of work to do,\" Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain told an audience in Munich last week.\n\nTrump's tone and the content of his Tuesday night speech will ultimately set Republicans' agenda for the near future, and could dictate whether they will be forced to answer new concerns from constituents or focus on their own long-standing wish list.\n\nTrump's propensity to get distracted by personal grievances and his administration's sloppy rollout of its immigration executive order\u2014now stalled in the courts\u2014have put Hill Republicans on defense rather than offense.\n\nRight before the recess, senators were briefed by FBI Director James Comey on the ongoing investigation into possible Trump's campaign ties to Russia.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, remain committed to playing defense on the Affordable Care Act and further investigating Trump's ties to Russia. In an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi argued that Trump's former campaign ally and now Attorney General Jeff Sessions needs to recuse himself from overseeing any investigation into Trump's campaign's ties to Russia.\n\nPelosi also argued that Republicans \"don't have the votes\" to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act despite their rhetoric. \"They do not have a replacement. What they have put forth and outlined will cost more to consumers. It will cover fewer people. It will give tax breaks to the wealthiest people,\" Pelosi said on ABC.",
    " Title: Clinton and Obama Administration Address Obamacare Criticism, Aim to Maintain and Improve Healthcare Legislation\n\nArticle:\n\nFollowing former President Bill Clinton's criticism of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) as \"the craziest thing in the world,\" the Obama administration and the Clinton campaign have sought to clarify his remarks and emphasize the need for improvements in the healthcare legislation.\n\nIn a news briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest defended the Affordable Care Act, acknowledging that there are areas for improvement. \"President Obama has, of course, acknowledged that, with cooperation from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, there are some things that could be done to further strengthen the law,\" said Earnest. \"That's something that Secretary [Hillary] Clinton has vowed to pursue if she is elected president of the United States, and President Obama is certainly going to do everything he can to support that effort.\"\n\nThe controversy began at a rally in Flint, Michigan, on Monday, where Clinton spoke about rising insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. \"You've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people are out there busting it sometimes 60 hours a week wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half,\" he said.\n\nAfter the rally, Clinton's aides and the campaign walked back his comments, stating that he is a supporter of Obamacare but wants to address lingering gaps in the insurance markets. However, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump seized on the opportunity, thanking Clinton for being \"honest\" about Obamacare at a rally in Arizona.\n\nWhen asked about Clinton's comments during the White House news briefing, Earnest said, \"It's not exactly clear to me what argument he was making, and so I'll let him and his team explain that.\" Earnest added that Obama remains \"proud\" of the Affordable Care Act, citing its success in expanding coverage, limiting the growth in healthcare costs, and providing consumer protections.\n\nAngel Urena, Clinton's press secretary, acknowledged that the former president was \"slightly short-handed\" but emphasized the need for improvement. \"That's why Secretary Clinton has proposed measures including tax relief to cover excessive out-of-pocket costs, a public option, and Medicare buy-in for those over 55,\" said Urena. \"She'll build on the progress we\u2019ve made by increasing competition, choice, affordability, and the number of Americans with insurance.\"\n\nHillary Clinton, who was stymied by Congress in the 1990s while trying to create affordable healthcare, said that the current Republican-controlled Congress wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act altogether, making it impossible for Obama to attempt changes in the law, as any changes require willing partners on Capitol Hill. Clinton reiterated her commitment to \"fix what's broken and keep what works.\"",
    " Title: Former US Diplomats and Senior Republicans Criticize Trump's Decision to Withdraw Troops from Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has drawn criticism from three senior Republicans and former US diplomats, President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria has been met with condemnation for its potential consequences. The withdrawal of around 1,000 troops, who are not on a combat mission but are in an advisory role, has been criticized as making little sense, as it could lead to the resurgence of ISIS and provide Turkey with free rein to carry out military operations against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), America's allies in the largely Kurdish Syrian region.\n\nThe SDF, who lost around 11,000 soldiers fighting ISIS, have been the United States' best allies in the region, while the US has had only 17 soldiers killed in action in both Syria and Iraq over the past five years. The withdrawal also risks undermining the US's leverage over events in Syria, a country whose regime is supported by Russia and Iran.\n\nThe criticism of Trump's decision is not new. Last December, Trump ordered the withdrawal of 2,000 US ground troops from Syria, which led to the resignation of then-Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, who saw the move as an abandonment of American allies on the battlefield. The US was eventually talked out of a total withdrawal from Syria due to the possibility that ISIS might return and because it would give Iran greater sway in the country.\n\nThe US has a history of withdrawing troops from Muslim states, which has led to the rise of jihadist terrorist groups. After the US pulled out of Iraq, the group that later became ISIS first organized in Syria in 2011, before it invaded Iraq three years later and took over much of the country.\n\nTrump's policy shift on Syria has been criticized for giving America's enemies an early heads-up about US military plans, a criticism Trump himself leveled against the total American troop withdrawal from Iraq under President Barack Obama in 2011. The announcement on Syria also underlines the collapse of any kind of deliberative national security process, as Trump appears to make unilateral decisions surrounded by a cabinet of yes-men and acolytes, after chasing out advisers like Mattis, former National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and former Chief of Staff John Kelly, all of whom tended to push back against Trump's more ill-advised decisions.",
    " Title: House Judiciary Committee Authorizes Subpoenas for Mueller Report and Associated Materials\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - In a move that brings the U.S. Congress closer to a potential legal confrontation with the Trump administration, the Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee has authorized its chairman, Jerrold Nadler, to subpoena Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full, unredacted report on Russia's role in the 2016 election, as well as all underlying evidence, documents, and testimony from five former Trump aides.\n\nThe Democratic-majority committee voted 24-17 to enable Nadler to subpoena the Justice Department for the unredacted Mueller report, as well as documents and testimony from political strategist Steve Bannon, former White House Counsel Donald McGahn, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, and former White House deputy counsel Ann Donaldson.\n\nNadler has not yet exercised this authority, with the timing of any such move uncertain. The committee vote was along party lines, with Democrats in favor and Trump's fellow Republicans opposed.\n\nAttorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee, issued a four-page summary of Mueller's main conclusions last month, stating that the special counsel did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election. Barr has pledged to release the nearly 400-page report by mid-April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence-gathering sources and methods.\n\nIn addition to Bannon, the committee authorized subpoenas for McGahn, Priebus, Hicks, and Donaldson, who are among 81 people, agencies, and entities the panel has sought documents from as part of its obstruction and corruption investigation into Trump and his associates.\n\nNadler's panel shifted its focus to subpoenas to obtain the Mueller report when it became clear Barr would not comply with a Democratic demand to turn it over unredacted by a Tuesday deadline. Democrats have expressed concern that Barr could use redactions to suppress evidence of potential misconduct by Trump and his campaign.\n\nNadler stated that he would work with Barr \"for a short period of time in the hope that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report and all the underlying materials.\" He added, \"But if that doesn't work out in a very short order, we will issue the subpoenas.\"\n\nThe potential battle between the executive and legislative branches over the subpoenas could end up being resolved by the federal government's third branch - the judiciary.\n\nRepresentative Doug Collins, the committee's top Republican, said Democrats are \"desperate for dirt on this president.\" Collins added, \"This is reckless. It's irresponsible. And it's disingenuous.\"\n\nIn another development, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee, led by Trump critic Adam Schiff, is seeking an interview with and documents from a top organizer on Trump's inaugural committee. The report could not immediately be confirmed by the Associated Press.\n\nBarr's March 24 letter to lawmakers explaining Mueller's \"principal conclusions\" stated that the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice. Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller's inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump.\n\nTrump has denied collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice. Moscow has denied election interference. Mueller and U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump.\n\nDemocrats have pledged to fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to enforce a subpoena and obtain the full report.\n\n\"If the department still refuses, then it should be up to a judge - not the president or his political appointee - to decide whether it is appropriate for the committee to review the complete record,\" Nadler said.\n\nTrump ally Lindsey Graham, Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter that the House panel's demand for classified information and grand jury testimony was \"dangerous and ridiculous.\"\n\nThe Justice Department declined comment. Priebus declined to comment. A lawyer for Priebus, Bannon, and McGahn, as well as a Bannon spokeswoman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nJustice Department regulations give the attorney general wide latitude on how much to release from special counsel inquiries. Nadler told reporters he would also seek a judge's permission to get access to Mueller's grand jury material, which is protected under federal law. Nadler stated that Barr has not been willing to seek a court order to release the data so far.\n\nRepublican Representative Jim Sensenbrenner said he would be willing to join legal action to obtain the grand jury material and predicted other Republicans would as well, noting that the House voted overwhelmingly last month for the full report's release to Congress.",

The second day of protests saw police reinforcements from other cities being sent in, as authorities struggled to maintain order.\n\nDozens of police officers formed moving lines in various parts of the city and used water cannons to disperse protesters from the streets. Hamburg boosted its police presence with reinforcements from around the country for the G20 summit but requested additional support after the situation escalated on Thursday night.\n\nAt least 45 demonstrators were arrested, 15 were temporarily detained, and 160 police officers were injured early Friday, including three officers who were hospitalized. Hamburg's fire department reported that 11 protesters were severely injured and transported to hospitals after falling from a wall during confrontations with police. The fire department also treated 26 people and took 14 of them to the hospital.\n\nHamburg Police tweeted, \"Our fears have been confirmed. Several of my colleagues were injured in yesterday's riots by high velocity projectiles.\" German police also tweeted that all leaders entered the city's convention center safely.\n\nThe leaders, including German host Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and many others, were meeting to discuss issues such as international terrorism and climate change.\n\nGerman Justice Minister Heiko Maas told reporters that the violent protests were a disservice to the large crowd of overwhelmingly peaceful demonstrators. \"Every peaceful protest is welcome,\" Maas said. \"But that is no free pass for unrestrained rampage.\"\n\nThe violence began on Thursday and continued into Friday, with demonstrators breaking windows at the Mongolian consulate and puncturing the tires of a car that belonged to the Canadian delegation. Police also reported that one of their helicopters was almost hit by a rocket flare, and a pilot of a different helicopter suffered eye injuries after a laser was pointed at them.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump arrived in Hamburg earlier Thursday following his speech in Warsaw where he called for defending Western values and rallying against \"dire threats\" to civilizations. \"Just as Poland can not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken,\" Trump said during his speech in Poland. \"Our values will prevail, our people will thrive, and our civilization will triumph.\"\n\nTrump and Merkel met privately after his arrival on Thursday, discussing issues that include North Korea, the situation in the Middle East, the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and \"some issues on the G20 agenda.\" U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel also participated, according to a German government statement. Trump then had dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\n\nOn Friday, Trump is slated to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin for about 35 minutes. Trump tweeted early Friday that he is looking forward to his meeting with the Russian president.",
    " Title: Republican Advantage in Senate Elections Fades as 2016 Approaches, According to Political Analyst Charlie Cook\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2014 midterm elections, the Republicans secured a majority in the Senate with a strategic advantage, as seven Democratic senators hailed from states that former presidential candidate Mitt Romney won handily in 2012, and there were few Republican seats at stake. However, political analyst Charlie Cook predicts a different landscape for the 2016 election cycle.\n\nRepublicans will have to defend 24 seats in the upcoming election, while Democrats will only need to defend 10. All 10 Democratic Senate seats are in states that President Barack Obama won in 2012, and seven of these states are currently held by the Republicans. These states include Florida, Illinois, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\nOne positive aspect for the Republicans is that the Senate seats up for re-election in blue states were not won by Obama by margins as wide as the red states won by Romney, where Democrats were up for re-election in 2014. The reddest state with a Democratic senator up for re-election in 2014 was West Virginia, which Romney won by 27 points in 2012. By contrast, the bluest state up for re-election with a Republican senator is Illinois, which Obama won by 17 points.\n\nAnother silver lining for the GOP is that not all states with Republican senators up for re-election that were won by Obama in 2012 are necessarily competitive. For instance, it is highly unlikely that Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley will lose in Iowa, even though the president won the Hawkeye State by 6 points in 2012. The competitiveness of the other states will depend on the Democratic challengers.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans may end up with an equal number of open seats up for re-election, with the Democrats having three open seats, two in deep blue states, and the Republicans having two open seats, with only one considered competitive.\n\nIf Democrats aim to regain the majority in the Senate, they will need to win four seats if a Democrat wins the presidential election, and five seats if they do not. The outcome of the Senate elections in 2016 will depend on various factors, including the candidates, the political climate, and the strategies employed by both parties.",
    " Title: National Poll Shows Tight Race Between Warren and Biden in Democratic Presidential Nomination\n\nArticle:\n\nA new national poll on the eve of the fourth-round Democratic presidential primary debate has shown a close race between Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden for the Democratic Party's nomination.\n\nAccording to a Quinnipiac University survey on Monday, Warren stood at 30 percent support among Democratic voters and independents who leaned toward the party, while Biden was at 27 percent. Warren's three-percentage-point advantage was within the survey's margin of error.\n\nThe poll marked the third time Quinnipiac has conducted a survey since late last month, with Warren holding a slight edge over Biden in all three. \"For Senator Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm,\" Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy emphasized. \"Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stood at 11 percent, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8 percent and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 4 percent. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, and billionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer each registered at 2 percent in the poll. The other candidates in the shrinking but still large field of contenders stood at 1 percent or less.\n\nQuinnipiac's survey differed from a Fox News poll released last week that indicated Biden at 32 percent, with Warren ten points back at 22 percent and Sanders at 17 percent. No other candidate cracked double digits in the Fox News survey.\n\nTwelve candidates have qualified for Tuesday's debate, which is set to be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. They are - in alphabetical order - Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Harris, Klobuchar, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, Sanders, Steyer, Warren, and Yang.\n\nWhile national primary horserace polls have garnered significant attention, the battle for the nomination is a fight for the states and their delegates. A new poll in New Hampshire, the state holding the first presidential primary, indicated a three-way tie at the top.\n\nWarren stood at 25 percent support among likely Democratic primary voters in the Granite State in a Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey, with Biden at 24 percent and Sanders at 22 percent. Buttigieg stood at 9 percent, and Harris at 5 percent, with no one else in the field topping 2 percent.\n\nIn New Hampshire's Republican presidential contest, President Trump remained the overwhelming favorite against three extreme long-shot primary challengers, but his support has deteriorated from 88 percent a month ago to 71 percent in the survey. One of the primary challengers, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, saw his support jump from 3 percent in early September to 14 percent in the new survey.\n\nThe Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University poll was conducted Oct. 9-13, with 422 likely Democratic primary voters and 405 likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire questioned by live telephone operators. The survey's margin of error was plus or minus 4.8 percentage points for Democratic primary questions and plus or minus 4.9 percentage points for GOP primary questions.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll was conducted October 11-13, with 1,195 self-identified registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The survey included 505 Democratic voters and independent voters leaning Democratic with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points.",
    " Title: Trump Administration and GOP Leaders Push for ObamaCare Repeal and Replacement, Discuss Strategy on Capitol Hill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a high-stakes showdown on Capitol Hill, President Obama and Vice President-elect Mike Pence met with their respective congressional allies on Wednesday to discuss strategies for the Republican's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare). While Obama urged Democrats to \"fight\" for the law's survival, Pence assured Republicans that the Trump administration will make the law's demise its \"first order of business.\"\n\nPence, speaking at a press conference after meeting with House Republicans, said, \"The first order of business is to repeal and replace ObamaCare. People voted for a better health care system, and we owe them that.\" He also sought to reassure supporters concerned about reports that party leaders could delay repeal efforts and lack a replacement plan.\n\nPence outlined a \"two-track approach,\" with President-elect Donald Trump using his executive powers, while leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress draft and pass the necessary legislation. He also mentioned that the incoming White House team is \"already working on a series of executive actions.\"\n\nSources told media outlets that Pence said in the meeting that Republicans hope to have a repeal bill on Trump's desk by Feb. 20, one month after the inauguration. However, both Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan were peppered with questions about when the repeal process would be complete and why they don't have an alternative health care plan.\n\nRyan responded, \"We have plenty of plans. We don't want to pull the rug out on people. We do not want people to be caught with nothing.\" Ending ObamaCare without a substitute plan could result in as many as 20 million Americans losing their health insurance, which would be a political disaster for Republicans.\n\nObama exited his 90-minute, closed-door meeting without comment but reportedly urged fellow Democrats not to \"rescue\" Republicans on what he suggested be called \"Trumpcare.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said afterward that Obama and fellow Democrats had a \"very inspiring\" meeting in which they discussed a strategy to save ObamaCare, then blasted Republicans for their repeal-replace agenda.\n\nThe visits come on the second day of the new, GOP-led Congress. Trump replacing Obama at the White House in 16 days puts the GOP's longtime goal of annulling much of the 2010 health care overhaul within reach. Trump, despite his campaign vows to repeal the law, warned his colleagues on Wednesday not to let Democrats off the hook for a program he called a \"disaster,\" while warning them to be careful in their methods.\n\nTrump has provided few specifics about how he would revamp the nation's $3 trillion-a-year health care system. Steps he and congressional Republicans have mentioned include greater reliance on tax credits to help people afford coverage and keeping such provisions as allowing young adults to stay on their parents' plan and providing access to coverage for Americans with pre-existing medical conditions.",
    " Title: House of Representatives Investigates Potential Lies by President Trump in Mueller Probe and Ukraine Call\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, House of Representatives investigators are delving into whether President Donald Trump may have lied to special counsel Robert Mueller during the Russia probe. This revelation was made in a court hearing on Monday, where Doug Letter, representing the House Judiciary Committee, requested files from the special counsel's inquiry.\n\nThe primary focus of the Democratic-led inquiry is on alleged abuse of power by Mr. Trump in US-Ukraine relations. However, it has been revealed that lawmakers are also scrutinizing the president's statements to Mr. Mueller regarding WikiLeaks.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, led by the House, is investigating whether the president lied to Mr. Mueller during the course of the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Doug Letter, in his court appearance, requested the redacted parts of the Mueller report and the full transcripts related to those portions.\n\nDuring the Mueller investigation, Mr. Trump did not testify, but he did submit written responses to some questions from the Mueller team. During Mr. Mueller's testimony before Congress in July, he was asked whether Mr. Trump's incomplete written responses showed he was not always telling the truth. Mr. Mueller replied, \"I would say, generally.\"\n\nThe exact meaning of Mr. Mueller's response is unclear, but Mr. Letter told the court on Monday he believed it meant the president \"had been untruthful in some of his answers.\" It is speculated that Mr. Letter may have been referring to whether Mr. Trump lied about contacts with WikiLeaks and knowledge that they were going to publish hacked Democratic emails.\n\nThe president has maintained that he did not know of any contact between his campaign and WikiLeaks and that he did not discuss WikiLeaks with his advisor, Roger Stone, who was convicted last week of lying to Congress about his work with WikiLeaks.\n\nA lawyer for the Department of Justice argued that the impeachment inquiry was not a judicial proceeding and thus it was not legal for lawmakers to view classified grand jury material. However, during the impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon, a federal judge granted the House access to grand jury materials.\n\nFollowing Monday's oral arguments, the appeals panel is considering the matter. Ahead of this development, Mr. Trump tweeted that he would \"strongly consider\" testifying to the impeachment inquiry \"in order to get Congress focused again.\"\n\nThis week, eight individuals are due to testify before House lawmakers as part of the impeachment proceedings. On Tuesday, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the National Security Council who listened in on Mr. Trump's July call with Ukraine's President Zelensky, will testify. The July call sparked a whistleblower complaint that eventually led to the start of the impeachment inquiry.",
    " Title: Biden Consolidates Lead in Democratic Race: A Look at the \"Mini Super Tuesday\" Results\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development in the Democratic primary race, former Vice President Joe Biden has consolidated his lead following the \"Mini Super Tuesday,\" a term used to describe the six states that held primary contests on Tuesday. The race now appears to be firmly in Biden's control, with the Vermont senator, Bernie Sanders, falling further behind.\n\nSix states, including Mississippi, Missouri, Michigan, Washington, Idaho, and North Dakota, held primary contests. Results from the latter three states are still pending, but Sanders will hope to do better there. However, the results so far indicate a different narrative.\n\nBiden won Mississippi, Missouri, and Michigan, with the latter state potentially marking a turning point in the campaign. In 2016, Michigan gave Sanders a surprise win, albeit a narrow one, but this time around, the Midwestern state could mark the beginning of the end for Sanders' campaign.\n\nExit polls suggest that the difference was in the demographic groups that Sanders won in 2016. In 2016, Sanders won white voters, union voters, and college graduates. On Tuesday night, Biden won these groups, carrying college graduates 51-44, whites 51-45, and union members - 30% of the primary electorate - 54-42.\n\nBiden's strong performance among black voters, late-deciders, and those looking for someone who can beat Donald Trump contributed to his comfortable win. The ease of the result has raised questions about whether the 2016 Michigan primary was a reflection of Hillary Clinton's weakness rather than Sanders' strength. At the very least, it's evidence that rather than improving on his 2016 performance, the Vermont senator is falling short.\n\nIn Mississippi, more than 60% of the electorate on primary night was black, and Biden dominated that demographic, to the tune of 86-11. The result is significant because it means Biden is likely to win the lion's share of the state's 36 delegates to the national convention, further extending his delegate lead.\n\nBernie Sanders performed best with the youth vote, ages 17 to 29, according to exit polls. He carried it 82-15 in Michigan and 76-19 in Missouri, and only lost it by 4% in Mississippi, despite being routed in the state. However, the youth vote averaged only 12.5% of the electorate in those three states, not nearly enough to save the day for Sanders.\n\nWhile this may be good news in the short term for Biden, it is a flashing warning sign for the general election if he is the nominee. Young voters were a key part of the coalition that delivered the White House to Barack Obama in 2008, as he won them by a record 34% over John McCain. If the former vice-president does not find some way to improve his standing with this age demographic, he may suffer the same fate as Hillary Clinton, who only won the youth vote by 18%.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Biden made his pitch to Sanders' voters, perhaps with the autumn campaign in mind. \"I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,\" he said. \"We share a common goal, and together we'll defeat Donald Trump.\" Of all those in the Sanders camp, the most tireless and passionate were his youngest fans. Perhaps this is the start of Biden's attempt to court their vote.",
    " Title: Migration Trend from High-Tax States to Low-Tax States Expected to Accelerate\n\nArticle:\n\nThe trend of Americans relocating from high-tax states, such as California and those in the Northeast, to low-tax states like Texas and Arizona, is set to increase, according to a report by Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore of the American Legislative Exchange Council. The change is attributed to the Republican Party's tax bill, which caps the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT).\n\nLaffer and Moore estimate that California and New York will lose approximately 800,000 residents over the next three years, nearly double the number from the previous three years. Connecticut, New Jersey, and Minnesota combined are expected to lose around 500,000 people in the same period.\n\nThe authors argue that the accelerated migration will lead to higher real-estate values in low-tax states and lower values in high-tax states. In states with high income taxes, such as California, New York, Minnesota, and New Jersey, high earners will bear more costs of their state government under the new SALT cap.\n\nWhile the law contains tax-rate cuts for businesses and individuals, taxpayers in high-tax states like those in the Northeast are expected to take a hit from the SALT change. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office claims the elimination of full SALT deductibility will cost that state $14.3 billion.\n\nIn contrast, nine states, including Florida, Nevada, Texas, and Washington, impose no tax on earned income. Since 2007, low-tax states like Texas and Florida have gained 1.4 million and 850,000 residents, respectively, from elsewhere in the U.S., while high-tax states like California and New York combined have lost more than 2.2 million residents.\n\nLast week, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott invited residents of high-tax New Jersey to move to Texas, citing his administration's $4 billion tax cut. Abbott's invitation followed New Jersey's newly sworn-in Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy's budget proposal requesting a $2.7 billion increase from the prior year's budget.",
    " Title: Christ Church Removes Memorial Plaques of George Washington and Robert E. Lee\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move aimed at fostering inclusivity and addressing contemporary sensitivities, Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia, has announced the removal of memorial plaques dedicated to its former vestryman, George Washington, and parishioner, Robert E. Lee. The decision, made by a unanimous vote of the vestry, follows a growing controversy surrounding the presence of these historical figures in the church.\n\nThe plaques, which have been a part of the church since 1870, are located on either side of the altar and have been a source of friction for some visitors, who feel they create an unwelcoming atmosphere. In a letter to the congregation, church leaders stated, \"The plaques in our sanctuary make some in our presence feel unsafe or unwelcome. Some visitors and guests who worship with us choose not to return because they receive an unintended message from the prominent presence of the plaques.\"\n\nThe church's Facebook page has since become a battleground, with supporters praising the church for its \"courageous\" stand, while critics have compared the church's leadership to extremist groups such as the Taliban or the Islamic State.\n\nThe plaques, which stand today, read \"In memory of George Washington\" and \"In Memory of Robert Edward Lee.\" The Washington plaque was purchased by the first president when the church opened in 1773, and he was a vestryman and contributor to the church throughout his life. Lee attended Christ Church from the age of 3, and his daughter, Mary Custis Lee, left the church $10,000 in her will upon her death in 1918, which was used to begin the church's endowment.\n\nChurch leaders have not yet decided whether they will return the $10,000 gift from Lee's daughter. The church's senior and junior wardens, as well as the rector, did not respond to questions about the decision.\n\nIn recent years, monuments associated with both Washington and Lee have been under scrutiny. Violence erupted in Charlottesville this year over a Lee statue, and the church Lee attended in Lexington, Virginia, changed its name from R.E. Lee Memorial Church to Grace Episcopal Church. The Washington National Cathedral also removed a stained-glass window with an image of Lee.\n\nDespite the removal of the plaques, Christ Church acknowledged the historical significance of both Washington and Lee, stating, \"George Washington was the visionary who not only refused to be king but also gave up power after eight years, and a symbol of our democracy. Robert E. Lee, for some, symbolizes the attempt to overthrow the Union and to preserve slavery.\"\n\nThe church leaders concluded their letter by acknowledging the ongoing struggle of the nation to grapple with its history of slavery and its aftermath, stating, \"Today our country is trying once again to come to grips with the history of slavery and the subsequent disenfranchisement of people of color.\" The church plans to find a new location for the plaques and to provide a fuller narrative of their history and the influence of these two men on the church and the country.",
    " Title: Obama Adjusts Economic Timeline as Campaign Trail Resumes Amidst Job Report Release\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a shift from his 2009 statement that failing to right the economy in three years would mean a \"one-term proposition,\" President Obama on Thursday seemed to move the goalposts for economic recovery. During a campaign trail appearance in Green Bay, Wis., the President stated, \"Now, we knew from the beginning that our work would take more than one year, or even one term -- because let's face it, the middle class was getting hammered long before the financial crisis hit.\"\n\nThe potential adjustment in the President's timetable for turning around the economy comes a day before the Labor Department is set to release the October jobs report. Last month's survey provided a seemingly positive outlook for the economy and Obama's re-election campaign, showing the jobless rate dipping below 8 percent. However, some economists have questioned the accuracy of the statistic, and the report being released Friday is the last major economic survey to drop before Election Day.\n\nThe President has consistently argued that he needs more time to complete the work he started. In an August 2011 fundraiser, he said, \"When I said change we can believe in, I did not say change we can believe in tomorrow.\"\n\nHowever, the claim that \"we knew from the beginning\" it would take more than one term is a departure from what Obama told NBC's Matt Lauer in February 2009. At the time, Obama said, \"A year from now, I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress, but there's still going to be some pain out there. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition.\"\n\nRomney's campaign responded to Obama's Green Bay remarks, stating, \"Four years ago, President Obama made a series of commitments to the nation and said that he did not deserve a second term if he failed to keep them.\" Romney's spokesman, Ryan Williams, added, \"Now, faced with a record of broken promises and failed policies, the President is trying to reissue and repackage the same pledges and mislead Americans into believing that the results will somehow be different.\"\n\nThursday marked the first day since Super Storm Sandy that both candidates were out on the trail in full force, and they engaged in a debate over who can claim the mantle of the \"change\" candidate. Romney's campaign asserts that the former Massachusetts governor is the only one offering \"real change.\" Obama, on the other hand, argued that his opponent is merely offering to return America to the policies of the George W. Bush administration\u2014policies that he claims unfairly favor the wealthy.\n\nThe President was campaigning Thursday in Wisconsin, Nevada, and Colorado, while Romney made a three-stop swing through Virginia. Notably, Romney's campaign also revealed Thursday that it is planning a rally in Pennsylvania, a state that has backed Democrats in recent presidential races. All four states are important battlegrounds, and Romney's campaign's push into Pennsylvania indicates a strategic move to expand the electoral map.",
    " Title: UN Arms Trade Treaty: A Closer Look at Second Amendment Implications\n\nArticle:\n\nThe United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) may have faced setbacks during the July conference in New York City, but as noted by Ted Bromund of the Heritage Foundation, the concept of the ATT is not easily discarded. The treaty's proponents are numerous, and the push for a new round of talks has already begun.\n\nOne question that warrants further discussion is whether the UN's assertion that the ATT will not infringe upon Second Amendment rights is genuine. Katie's recent post raises this point, and it is a valid concern given the Obama administration's stance on gun control and the president's commitment to the right to bear arms.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the ratification of UN treaties does not require a two-thirds majority in the Senate. As Bromund explains in a separate article, if the ATT produces a treaty open for signature, President Obama may sign it immediately. The U.S. would then be legally bound not to undermine the treaty's \"object and purpose.\" The interpretation of this phrase will rest with the State Department's lawyers, whose decisions may not be easily subject to legislative oversight.\n\nFurthermore, the UN's report titled \"The Impact of Poorly Regulated Arms Transfers on the Work of the UN\" acknowledges the right to self-defense and the lawful ownership and use of weapons. However, it also states that the arms trade must be regulated to minimize the risk of misuse of legally owned weapons due to the problem of diversion.\n\nThe Obama administration has also claimed that the ATT will not pose a threat to domestic gun owners. However, a Washington Times editorial questions the sincerity of these claims, citing the treaty's broad, vague, and poorly defined language, which could potentially be interpreted in ways that infringe upon the Second Amendment.\n\nIt is important to note that the ATT will not prevent violence, terrorism, or intra-state conflicts, as its supporters claim. The logistics of the treaty's implementation are complex, and the fact that the Obama administration is willing to collaborate with dictatorial regimes like Iran is concerning.\n\nGiven the Obama administration's history of questionable honesty and transparency, as demonstrated by issues such as Obamacare and Benghazi, Americans may want to approach the administration's assurances about the ATT with skepticism. Additionally, the surge in gun sales during Obama's first term and the subsequent rise in gun stocks since his reelection suggest that Americans are not taking the administration at their word.\n\nIn conclusion, the UN Arms Trade Treaty raises valid concerns regarding the potential infringement on Second Amendment rights, and Americans should remain vigilant and informed about the treaty's progress and implications.",
    " Title: San Francisco Police Department Instructed Officers Not to Use Body-Worn Cameras During Journalist's Home Raid, Memo Reveals\n\nA San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) memo obtained through a public records request reveals that police were instructed not to use body-worn cameras during the high-profile raid of journalist Bryan Carmody's home last year.\n\nIn the two-paragraph memo, Lieutenant Pilar Torres states that he told law enforcement officers conducting the raid \"not to utilize our Department issued BWC's for this operation\" because the video footage could compromise the \"confidential investigation.\"\n\nKatie Townsend, legal director for the Reporters Committee, commented, \"Body-worn cameras are designed to increase police transparency and accountability. The fact that officers were instructed not to use their bodycams during an illegal raid of a journalist's home is deeply troubling.\"\n\nIn an email response to Reporters Committee questions, SFPD spokesman Sgt. Michael Andraychak said the department is not able to provide additional information about the memo \"due to pending administrative investigations.\"\n\nThe SFPD raided Carmody's home with search warrants and a sledgehammer on May 10, 2019, about a month after the freelance journalist refused to reveal the source of a leaked police report concerning the death of Jeff Adachi, a longtime San Francisco public defender. Officers seized computers, cameras, and phones from Carmody's home before conducting a separate search of the journalist's office.\n\nAll of the search warrants were later deemed illegal under California's \"shield law,\" which protects journalists' confidential sources and materials. In March, San Francisco agreed to pay Carmody $369,000 to settle a claim filed by the journalist.\n\nThe incident sparked nationwide outrage, especially among journalists and press freedom advocates. The unexplained presence of the FBI at the search, and the fact that agents questioned Carmody about his source, amplified the press freedom concerns in the case.\n\nLast May, the Reporters Committee called for an investigation into the raid. The Reporters Committee and a coalition of 60 media organizations then urged a California court to return Carmody's seized materials. The Reporters Committee, First Amendment Coalition, and Northern California Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists also sued to unseal Carmody's arrest and search warrant records.\n\nThe Reporters Committee has also pursued records related to the FBI's presence during the raid. According to an FBI document obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit the Reporters Committee filed in September, FBI agents knew Carmody was a journalist when they questioned him. It is unclear whether the FBI followed Justice Department guidelines requiring authorization from the attorney general before questioning a member of the news media.\n\nThe Reporters Committee regularly files friend-of-the-court briefs and its attorneys represent journalists and news organizations pro bono in court cases that involve First Amendment freedoms, the newsgathering rights of journalists, and access to public information.

The Antifa members reportedly began shouting, chanting, and making threatening remarks towards Kirk and Owens. The situation escalated, with Kirk being doused with water, and the police had to intervene for safety reasons.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Owens described the incident, stating, \"So @RealCandaceO & I were peacefully eating breakfast this morning. Within 20 mins ANTIFA mobilized a protest, started screaming at us, attacked us, & threatened death against us.\"\n\nKirk also shared his account of the incident, tweeting, \"Tolerant leftist says @RealCandaceO and I are lucky we didn\u2019t get tarred and feathered today for having breakfast in Philly.\"\n\nBoth Kirk and Owens appeared on Sean Hannity's show on Fox News Monday night to discuss the incident. The duo's allegations have sparked a heated debate online, with some expressing support and others questioning the details of the incident.\n\nThe Philadelphia Police Department has not yet issued a statement regarding the incident. Antifa, known for their left-wing, anti-fascist ideology, has been involved in several similar incidents across the United States in recent years.\n\nThis incident comes amidst ongoing political tensions and heated debates, with many on both sides of the political spectrum expressing concern over the escalating violence and rhetoric. The Philadelphia Police Department has been urged to investigate the incident and provide a detailed report on the events that transpired.",
    " Title: President Obama Nominates Jeh Johnson as Homeland Security Secretary\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident Barack Obama has announced his intention to nominate Jeh Johnson, former Pentagon attorney, as the next Secretary of Homeland Security. The announcement was made by a White House official on Thursday, with the president set to introduce Johnson at a ceremony on Friday.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Johnson will replace Janet Napolitano, who left the administration to head the University of California education system. Johnson's qualifications for the position are attributed to his service as the senior lawyer for the Department of Defense during Obama's first term.\n\nThe official stated that during his tenure at the Defense Department, Johnson demonstrated \"sound judgment\" and provided \"prior legal review and approval of every military operation approved by the president and secretary of Defense.\"\n\nJohnson, who is set to be the fourth head of the Department of Homeland Security, created in response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, is described as a \"critical member of the president's counterterrorism team\" and someone who worked closely with Homeland Security officials during his years at the Pentagon.\n\nHis areas of expertise include cybersecurity, and he played a key role in repealing the Pentagon's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy that prohibited openly gay servicemembers. Johnson also provided legal guidance in the use of unmanned drones against terrorism suspects overseas, and in the use of military commissions instead of civilian courts to try suspects.\n\nJohnson, who left his Pentagon post in 2012, also led a crackdown on unauthorized news leaks at the Defense Department, including a warning to a former Navy SEAL who wrote a book about the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nDuring a speech at Britain's Oxford University last year, Johnson expressed the view that the nation's war on terrorism should not be endless, and the focus should shift to law enforcement and intelligence operations.\n\n\"War must be regarded as a finite, extraordinary, and unnatural state of affairs,\" Johnson said. \"In its 12th year, we must not accept the current conflict, and all that it entails, as the new normal.\"\n\nThe Senate confirmation hearing will likely delve into these and other topics. Elisa Massimino, president of Human Rights First, praised Johnson for his efforts to balance national security with human rights and American ideals during his time at the Pentagon.\n\nHowever, not all reactions have been positive. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) criticized Obama for nominating a \"loyalist and fundraiser\" to lead what he called a \"mismanaged\" department. Sessions expressed concern that the department needs a \"proven manager with strong relevant law enforcement experience, recognized independence and integrity.\"\n\nAn early political supporter of Obama, Johnson, a native of Wappingers Falls, N.Y., also served as general counsel to the Air Force during President Clinton's administration.",
    " Title: Budget Wars: A Historical Perspective on the Recurring Fiscal Cliffs and the Normalization of Shutdown Tactics\n\nArticle:\n\nThe ongoing budget battles in the United States Congress have become a recurring theme, with each resolution over taxes and spending leading to another round of fighting. The latest standoff, which could potentially lead to a government shutdown this week, has once again brought the nation's broken budget process into the spotlight.\n\nJulian Zelizer, a political historian at Princeton University, notes that the budget battles have grown worse with each passing resolution, and that the tactic of threatening to veto a debt limit increase has become the new normal. Zelizer suggests that this is a good time to discuss reforming the budget process.\n\nOne of the main drivers of the budget wars is partisan strategy. Polarization has made almost every issue more contentious on Capitol Hill. In recent years, Republicans, in particular, have used the budget as a means to handcuff Democratic presidents.\n\nThe strategy has deep roots, with conservative Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans focusing on rising deficits in the 1960s to force President Lyndon Johnson to accept deep spending cuts. In the 1990s, Republicans shut down the federal government with their push for spending cuts, even after the backlash helped President Bill Clinton regain his political standing. Since 2010, a growing number of Republicans have been willing to use aggressive tactics to force President Barack Obama's hand on this issue.\n\nAnother reason the budgeting process is becoming ever more brutal is because, historically, once legislators break the barrier of using a certain tactic, the practice can become normalized. The best example is the filibuster, which was once a rare weapon reserved for high-profile issues. However, since the 1970s, the filibuster has become a routine weapon in partisan combat.\n\nThe budget wars are also fueled by the 24-hour news media, which is constantly in search of dramatic stories to win attention. The budget war offers great fodder, with the possibility of a fiscal cliff providing political junkies a thrill akin to \"Breaking Bad\" fans. As a result, legislators who gain attention through dramatic stands, such as Sen. Ted Cruz, remain in the headlines.\n\nAt some point, there will be pressure to reform the process. The latest round of budget battles has led a larger number of Republicans, like Sen. John McCain, to be openly critical of their colleagues and call for a very different approach. As Rep. Peter King, an opponent of the Affordable Care Act, explained, \"I still think we should try to repeal the bill. But you repeal it the same way you passed it. You get bills through both houses of Congress, and you get the president to sign it.\"\n\nBudget reform is possible, and there have been several moments in U.S. history when Congress overhauled the entire budget process. It might be time to start that debate again.",
    " Title: Former CIA Agent Raises Concern Over Islamic State Presence in U.S.\n\nArticle:\n\nFormer CIA agent Bob Baer has expressed concern over the presence of Islamic State (ISIS) cells within the United States. In an interview with CNN, Baer stated that while the exact plans of these cells are unknown, they pose a significant threat.\n\nBaer, who has worked in intelligence-gathering, revealed that some ISIS members have entered the U.S. by crossing the Mexican border. He emphasized that intelligence agencies are aware of some suspected ISIS members and are working to gather evidence for their apprehension. However, there is a fear that there may be more individuals who have not yet been identified.\n\nISIS, currently known as the Islamic State, has taken control of large portions of Syria and Iraq, declaring a caliphate from which they plan to wage global jihad. A spokesman recently stated that ISIS aims to raise the Islamic flag in the White House.\n\nOn Tuesday, ISIS released a video featuring American journalist Steven Sotloff, marking the second such video in the past two weeks. The group had previously threatened to behead Sotloff if the U.S. did not cease airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. This follows the beheading of American journalist James Foley under similar circumstances.\n\nBaer suggested that the killings were a response to U.S. airstrikes hindering ISIS' efforts in Iraq. He stated, \"They have no choice in their minds but to strike back.\"\n\nAt least four Americans are publicly known to be held by ISIS, according to Baer, who suggested that they were chosen randomly to carry out the gruesome actions seen in the videos.\n\nWith ISIS continuing to be affected by American attacks, Baer expects further beheadings of Western captives. \"I think there will be more,\" he said.\n\nThis development underscores the ongoing global threat posed by ISIS and the need for continued vigilance and intelligence-gathering efforts.",
    " Title: AstraZeneca-Oxford Vaccine Shows Promise in Early-Stage Trials, Boosting Global Efforts Against COVID-19\n\nAn experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University has shown an immune response in early-stage clinical trials, according to data published in The Lancet medical journal on Monday. The vaccine, known as AZD1222, is being hailed as a leading candidate in the global race to combat a pandemic that has claimed over 600,000 lives.\n\nThe vaccine, which has not caused any serious side effects, elicited antibody and T-cell immune responses, with the strongest response seen in individuals who received two doses. The results, while promising, are still at an early stage, and researchers caution that more work is needed to confirm the vaccine's effectiveness in managing the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe vaccine's developers, including Sarah Gilbert of Oxford University, have been cautious in their interpretation of the results. They emphasize that they do not yet know the strength of the immune response required to effectively protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nAstraZeneca shares surged 10% following the announcement, but then gave up most of those gains, closing up 1.45% on the day. The company has signed agreements with governments worldwide to supply the vaccine should it prove effective and gain regulatory approval. AstraZeneca has stated that it will not seek to profit from the vaccine during the pandemic.\n\nAstraZeneca is on track to begin producing doses by September, but the timeline for the vaccine's availability this year depends on the completion of late-stage trials. Late-stage trials are currently underway in Brazil and South Africa, and are due to start in the United States, where prevalence is higher.\n\nThe early-stage trial results suggest a stronger immune response in 10 people given an extra dose of the vaccine after 28 days, mirroring a trial in pigs. However, the number of doses required to provide immunity remains uncertain, with Oxford's Gilbert stating, \"It may be that we don't need two doses, but we want to know what we can achieve.\"\n\nAstraZeneca's biopharma chief, Mene Pangalos, has indicated a preference for a two-dose strategy in later-stage trials, to avoid the risk of a single or lower dose that might not work. The antibody levels generated by the vaccine are \"in the region\" of those seen in convalescent patients, according to Pangalos.\n\nThe global race to develop a viable COVID-19 vaccine continues, with more than 150 possible vaccines in various stages of development. Positive responses have also been reported for vaccines from Pfizer and China's CanSino Biologics. The development and distribution of these vaccines are crucial in the global effort to control the ongoing pandemic.",
    " Title: Trump's Economic Speech in Detroit: A Blend of Conservative Policies and Populist Agenda\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant shift in his political rhetoric, Donald Trump delivered a policy-focused economic speech in Detroit on Monday, aiming to reassure mainstream Republicans and unite the party amidst concerns over his sliding poll numbers. The speech, which saw Trump calmly handling 13 interruptions by protesters, presented a policy agenda that Republicans could rally around, including a sharp critique of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and a focus on trade and tax reform.\n\nTrump's speech, in essence, was a blend of conservative economic theory and his populist appeal, as he sought to address the concerns of both the Republican base and the broader electorate. In an effort to reassure those who favor international trade, Trump emphasized the need for \"only great and well-crafted trade deals where we as a country for once benefit.\" However, he also appealed to the workers who support his \"America first\" philosophy by stating, \"Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.\"\n\nRepublican strategist Ford O'Connell described the speech as a \"reset and contrast speech,\" noting that it was one of Trump's best policy speeches due to its successful integration of conservative economic principles with Trump's populist message.\n\nIn terms of specific policy proposals, Trump outlined his tax plan, which includes lowering the top federal individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, reducing the number of tax brackets from seven to three (33 percent, 25 percent, and 12 percent), and lowering the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. He also proposed allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of child-care spending from their taxes and imposing tariffs against countries that \"cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods.\"\n\nTrump's tax plan is expected to raise more revenue than his earlier proposal, which was forecast to cost $10 trillion over a decade. However, economist Jared Bernstein, a former member of President Obama's economic team, criticized the plan for being \"Republican-orthodoxy tax cuts on steroids with pretty punishing tariffs on imports thrown in.\" Bernstein also raised concerns about the potential loopholes in Trump's plan for \"pass-through\" income, which could benefit the wealthy.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, president of American Action Forum and the chief economic adviser to GOP presidential nominee John McCain in 2008, described Trump's tax plan as a \"peace offering to House Republicans,\" but also noted Trump's outreach to labor by adopting Democratic positions on trade and infrastructure. Trump's infrastructure plan, which is said to be double what Clinton is proposing, was met with praise from economists, but concerns were raised about the lack of details and the limitations of federal government involvement in infrastructure projects.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's economic speech in Detroit marked a shift in his political rhetoric, presenting a policy agenda that Republicans could rally around. However, the long-term implications and feasibility of his proposals remain a topic of debate among economists and political analysts.",
    " Title: One Federal Employee Lost Job Due to Sequestration, According to Government Audit\n\nArticle:\n\nA recent audit by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has revealed that only one employee in the entire federal government lost their job due to sequestration. The audit, released last month, found the only permanent cut came at the U.S. Parole Commission, which eliminated one position.\n\nSen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, commented on the audit's findings on Wednesday, stating that the concerns over sequestration's impact on jobs were overblown.\n\n\"Despite relentless warnings about the dire consequences of sequestration's budget cuts, it appears sequestration resulted in only one layoff,\" he said. \"While that's good news for federal employees and other workers, it is devastating to the credibility of Washington politicians and administration officials who spent months\u2014and millions of dollars\u2014engaging in a coordinated multi-agency cabinet-level public relations campaign to scare the American people.\"\n\nA year ago, sequestration was a significant part of the political conversation in Washington. The cuts, which took effect on March 1, 2013, reduced spending at nearly every federal department and agency. President Obama and Democrats on Capitol Hill warned of devastating impacts on government services and a major dent to the economy.\n\nCongress mitigated some of the impacts, passing legislation to keep air traffic controllers and meat plant inspectors on the job. However, most agencies ended up coping with the cuts, which ran as high as 7 percent.\n\nThe White House famously closed itself to public tours, while other agencies took deeper actions. Seven departments or agencies did furlough employees, but even that was less than a third of government agencies and departments surveyed by the GAO. Instead, those 15 departments and agencies that didn't furlough employees ended up using leftover savings or cutting other programs.\n\n\"NASA slowed down development of the program that will allow the U.S. to stop relying on Russia for trips to the International Space Station. At the same time, NASA\u2014like most agencies\u2014did not furlough any employees,\" Mr. Coburn wrote in a letter to the White House budget office.\n\nHe asked Director Sylvia Burwell to explain why some programs were cut but federal employees were spared. The budget office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAccording to the GAO, nearly every agency or department affected by sequestration canceled or limited bonuses, cut travel and training, and limited overtime. Nearly half of agencies and departments offered employees early retirement or bonus payments to get them to leave early. However, most managed to avoid furloughing or cutting jobs altogether.",
    " Title: Political Analyst Suggests Al Gore as Potential Democratic Presidential Candidate\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent article for Salon, political theorist Sean Illing has proposed that former Vice President Al Gore could be a viable alternative for the Democratic Party in the upcoming presidential election. Illing, who offers 10 reasons for his belief in Gore's potential, suggests that the former vice president could bridge the party's establishment and progressive wings.\n\nAccording to Illing, Gore's candidacy would offer a fresh perspective, despite his political history. His activism and business acumen have kept him in the public consciousness, and the freedom of not having to run for office has improved his image, Illing notes.\n\nThe proposal has garnered positive reactions from various media outlets, including Powerline, Newsbusters, the Legal Insurrection blog, and PJ Media, which summarized the trend as \"Anybody but Hillary!\"\n\nRumors about Gore's potential presidential bid have circulated for about a year, along with reports that he has adopted a vegetarian lifestyle. The former vice president has denied any interest in running, and has been busy with climate matters and the \"Live Earth - Road to Paris\" concert, scheduled for September 19, which aims to promote \"climate action\" with artists like Pharrell Williams.\n\nHowever, there has been a recent development. When asked directly about endorsing Hillary Clinton for the White House during an interview at an advertising awards symposium in France in late June, Gore declined, stating that it was \"too early\" to weigh in. This has sparked renewed speculation about Gore's potential candidacy.",
    " Title: Trump Administration Enforces Church Amendment Against University of Vermont Medical Center Over Abortion Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nThe Trump administration has taken action against the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMC) following a nurse's claim that her supervisors compelled her to participate in an abortion against her will, in violation of the Church Amendment. Jordan Sekulow, an attorney representing the nurse from the American Center for Law & Justice (ACLJ), stated on \"Fox & Friends\" that President Trump, through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the first president to enforce this federal law, passed by Congress in 1973, to protect the conscience rights of medical professionals.\n\nOn May 9, 2018, the anonymous Catholic nurse filed a conscience and religious discrimination complaint against UVMC, alleging they violated the law by forcing her to assist in an elective abortion despite her conscience-based objection. The nurse believed she was assisting in a miscarriage, but later discovered it was an abortion.\n\nIn response to the allegations, HHS's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has given UVMC, located in Burlington, Vt., 30 days to change its policies. Sekulow claims that UVMC's policy, which dates back to 2017 when the medical center began performing elective abortions, disregards the nurse's rights.\n\nAccording to Sekulow, the former Planned Parenthood chairman who came in as a new chairman of the Board of Trustees at UVMC \"definitely has an animus to pro-life nurses, medical professionals, even doctors.\"\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, UVMC asserted that they have \"robust, formal protections that safeguard both our employees' religious, ethical, and cultural beliefs, and our patients' rights to access safe and legal abortion.\" The medical center added that they \"do not discriminate against any employees for exercising their rights to opt out of procedures to which they object, including 'termination of pregnancy.'\"\n\nSekulow, however, contends that UVMC is ignoring the nurse's rights by stating, \"If we can accommodate you, we will. That's not the federal law that was passed by Congress. That's not what HHS enforces... You must accommodate the objector.\"",

The meeting, which will take place in Finland, comes as the United States continues its efforts to restore democracy in Venezuela.\n\nDuring a press briefing on his aircraft en route to Finland, Pompeo discussed the current situation in Venezuela, stating, \"We're trying to make sure the Venezuelan people get the elected democracy they deserve. That's our mission.\" He also emphasized the U.S.'s readiness to assist.\n\nPompeo expressed concern over Maduro's grip on power, stating, \"Maduro has to see that this is falling apart on him. I said earlier today that he still rules, there's no way he can govern. The situation on the ground continues to get worse for the Venezuelan people.\"\n\nThe U.S. Secretary of State further elaborated on the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, noting that while Maduro managed to maintain control over the military in some respects this week, several high-ranking military officials and intelligence officers had departed. He suggested that Maduro's tenure is limited, though he did not specify a timeline for Maduro's departure.\n\nAccording to Pompeo and other administration officials, Maduro was persuaded by the Russians to remain in Venezuela after he was prepared to leave permanently for Cuba last week. In response to continued Russian interference, White House National Security Advisor John Bolton stated on Twitter, \"The United States will not tolerate foreign military interference in the Western Hemisphere. President Trump has made it clear that there will be costs for those who further Maduro's usurpation and repression.\"\n\nIn addition to the Venezuela crisis, Pompeo will also deliver a speech on Arctic policy and meet with several leaders from the Arctic Council during his time in Finland.",
    " Title: Obama and Romney Sharpen Tones Ahead of Final Presidential Debate\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the third and final presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney approaches, the candidates have returned to their campaign trails after a brief respite at the Al Smith dinner. The tone of their jokes at the dinner has given way to more pointed remarks as they prepare for the foreign policy-focused debate in Florida on Monday.\n\nAt an event at George Mason University today, President Obama continued to make jokes, but they carried a punch. \"Romney is changing up so much and backtracking and side-stepping we've got to name this condition he's going through,\" said the president. \"I think it's called...Romnesia,\" he added to cheers and laughter. \"I'm not a medical doctor, but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you because I want to make sure nobody else catches it.\"\n\nFollowing his stump in Virginia today, the president will spend the weekend at Camp David preparing for the debate. Meanwhile, Romney headed to Boca Raton, the site of the debate, where he will hold a fundraiser and begin another round of debate prep.\n\nThe debates this year have taken on an outsize importance, and as the race tightens, the stakes for Monday's faceoff could not be higher. Following their first matchup, Mitt Romney received his most significant bump in the polls all year. And following the second debate, Obama had his best day of fundraising ever, including the 2008 campaign.\n\n\"This race is close,\" said Albert May, a professor of political communication at George Washington University. \"Anything that moves the polls a point or two is going to be important.\"\n\nMonday's debate will focus on foreign policy, an area of expertise on which the president has traditionally polled better. Last week's debate, however, exposed a chink in the president's record, particularly when it came to his understanding and announcing the causes for the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead.\n\nA new report out today suggests that the CIA station chief in Libya reported to Washington within 24 hours of the attack that there was evidence that terrorists were behind the assault. Romney has scored points on foreign policy by criticizing the president for not quickly and categorically ascribing the attack to terrorists.\n\n\"Of course the debate is important,\" said a Romney campaign staffer unauthorized to speak for attribution. \"Given the president's shifting record on Libya, I imagine it will come up in a debate on foreign policy.\"\n\n\"On Monday, the President will discuss how he's kept his promise to the American people to end the war in Iraq in a responsible way, refocus on al-Qaeda, and put forward a plan to end the war in Afghanistan,\" said an Obama staffer on background. \"In contrast, all that Mitt Romney has offered in blunder and bluster. He said he would not move heaven and earth to get bin Laden. He called Russia, rather than al-Qaeda, our number one foe.\"\n\n\"We need a President who not only keeps us safe in the world, but also understands the need for steady leadership and keeping us out of endless wars. On these points, Mitt Romney has failed,\" said the Obama staffer. \"This debate might not have as much impact as the first debate, largely because they've tested each other. It also might not just be about foreign policy, and it won't be just about Libya. They'll talk about Libya, China, and Russia.\"\n\nAccording to a comprehensive Gallup study, only two debates between 1960 and 2004 moved the meter and quantifiably changed the direction of the polls and the outcome of the election. But this year's debates seem to be altering the electoral landscape.\n\nFollowing the first debate two weeks ago, and a lackluster performance by Obama, Romney saw a sustained bounce in the polls, drawing him close to Obama or putting him ahead of the president nationally, according to a flurry of polls. The Obama campaign was bolstered today by fresh NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls that found Obama with healthy leads in two key swing states, holding a 51-43 lead over Romney in Iowa and a 51-45 lead in Wisconsin.\n\nThe debates matter in another way. President Obama had his best fundraising day ever following last week's debate in New York, according to the AP. The AP also crunched the numbers to reveal the biggest campaign contributors. Both candidates have big-name backers. Hollywood director Jeffrey Katzenberg, Obama's single biggest contributor, gave the campaign $2.5 million. And Sheldon Adelson, who has said he would be willing to give Romney $100 million, cashes in as his biggest supporter with a whopping $34.2 million.",
    " Title: Hispanic Advocacy Group Questions Hillary Clinton's Immigration Stance Amid 2008 Presidential Campaign Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nA Hispanic advocacy group has raised questions about Hillary Rodham Clinton's commitment to immigration reform following revelations that former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer canceled driver's license initiatives for undocumented immigrants to support Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nIn an interview with David Axelrod, a former top strategist for President Obama, Spitzer revealed that the Clinton campaign had asked him to abandon the proposal to avoid complicating her campaign narrative. At the time, Clinton was the junior Democratic senator from New York, and her stance on the issue was unclear during a debate.\n\nCarlos Vargas, co-director of the Dream Action Coalition, a group representing undocumented immigrants known as \"Dreamers,\" expressed disappointment with Clinton, stating, \"Dreamers and Latinos are truly disappointed that Hillary Clinton would throw the immigrant community under the bus, especially since she has criticized others for doing the same.\"\n\nThe Dream Action Coalition further stated that Clinton's record is becoming increasingly suspect as she seeks the Democratic presidential nomination once more. Hispanic-rights advocates have expressed dismay as they've observed both parties experimenting with immigration reform bills, only to abandon them when the political climate becomes challenging.\n\nThe issue of driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants was a contentious topic in 2007, arising just a few years after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, during which hijackers used valid licenses to board the planes they crashed, resulting in the deaths of nearly 3,000 Americans.\n\nClinton initially avoided taking a clear stance on the issue, appearing to support and oppose it at different times. She eventually announced that she would not support states issuing such licenses. However, in her current campaign, Clinton has stated that she would now support such policies.\n\nClinton's two main opponents for the Democratic nomination have emphasized their consistent support for Hispanic rights throughout their careers, taking unpopular stands on these issues.",
    " Title: Bernie Sanders Endorses Democratic Primary Challenger of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that escalates the ongoing feud between the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Bernie Sanders campaign, the Vermont Senator has publicly endorsed Debbie Wasserman Schultz's primary opponent, Tim Canova. In an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Sanders expressed his support for Canova, stating that his views are more aligned with the Florida congressional candidate than with Wasserman Schultz.\n\nSanders' endorsement comes amidst a growing rift between the DNC and the Sanders campaign, with the latter accusing the DNC of favoring Hillary Clinton during the primary process. The Sanders campaign has criticized the DNC for factors such as Saturday night debates, closed primaries in major states, and the use of superdelegates.\n\nCanova, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University, was previously part of Sanders' Wall Street reform advisory panel. In response to Sanders' endorsement, Canova expressed his gratitude and shared his campaign's focus on representing the people, not big corporations.\n\nWasserman Schultz, in response, maintained her neutrality in the Democratic presidential race despite Sanders' endorsement of her primary opponent. She stated her commitment to serving the people of Florida's 23rd district and her confidence in her ability to advocate for them in Congress.\n\nThe endorsement could potentially impact the race, as Sanders has a strong fundraising ability. However, Sanders did not fare well in Wasserman Schultz's congressional district during the March Florida primary, with Clinton receiving 68% of the vote compared to Sanders' 30.1%.\n\nThe feud between Sanders and Wasserman Schultz has been ongoing, with the DNC chairwoman criticizing Sanders' handling of his supporters' behavior at the party's raucous Nevada convention last week. Sanders has also criticized the DNC's handling of the primary process and the role of superdelegates.\n\nSanders reiterated his belief that he is the stronger candidate against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, citing polls showing him performing better in a matchup. However, he acknowledged that Clinton also has a good chance of beating Trump.",
    " Title: Nikki Haley Delivers Humorous and Politically-Charged Speech at Al Smith Dinner\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a humorous and politically-charged speech at the annual Al Smith dinner in New York City, outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley poked fun at President Donald Trump, Kanye West, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Elizabeth Warren. The event, which is known for its light-hearted jabs at political figures, provided Haley with an opportunity to showcase her wit and charm.\n\nHaley, a former governor of South Carolina, joked about being invited to the dinner to \"spice things up\" after a \"choir boy\" appearance by House Speaker Paul Ryan last year. She also made light of the controversy surrounding Elizabeth Warren's DNA test, joking that the Catholic charity invited her because they wanted \"an Indian woman,\" but Warren \"failed her DNA test.\"\n\nWarren, who has been criticized by Trump for her claims of Native American heritage, released the findings of a DNA test this week, which opened her up to jokes. Haley, a Republican star with possible presidential ambitions, said Trump called to offer her some advice for her remarks, telling her to \"brag about my accomplishments.\"\n\nHaley did not offer any new insights into her decision to step down as U.N. ambassador, but she did take aim at the \"fake news\" surrounding her departure, including a rumor that rapper Kanye West had been sworn in as her replacement.\n\nHaley also used the high-profile moment to offer her assessment of the state of U.S. politics, noting the \"toxic political environment\" that has prompted politicians in both parties to \"describe their opponents as enemies or evil.\" She emphasized that \"In America, our political opponents are not evil.\"\n\nThe speech also included jabs at other political figures, including Jeff Sessions, whom Haley joked about looking for a job on LinkedIn, and President Barack Obama, whom she criticized for his comments on using the FBI and the Justice Department to punish political enemies. Haley also took a jab at the President's reaction to Bob Woodward's book, comparing him to a fifth-grader.\n\nThe dinner, now in its seventh-decade, raised almost $4 million for the Catholic children's charities this year. The event, hosted by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, attracted a high-powered crowd of some 700 people that included Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, CBS anchor Jeff Glor, and Wall Street financier Stephen Schwarzman.",
    " Title: Vice President Mike Pence Accuses CNN of Dishonest Coverage During Border Facility Visit\n\nArticle:\n\nVice President Mike Pence visited migrant shelters in the McAllen, Texas, area on Friday and took to Twitter to criticize CNN for its coverage of his trip, labeling it as \"dishonest.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets, Pence stated, \"CNN is so dishonest. Today we took reporters to a detention facility on the border for families and children and all told us they were being treated well.\"\n\nThe vice president's tweet came in response to CNN, which reportedly aired a video of a large group of crowded migrants, all of whom were men who shouted \"no shower!\" to cameras. While the prime-time show Anderson Cooper 360 aired Pence's interview with CNN senior White House correspondent Pamela Brown, it split the screen, only showing the sizable group of male migrants and \"none of the footage of Pence visiting with children,\" according to Fox News.\n\nPence also defended U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents from the smears by freshmen Democrats comparing holding centers to concentration camps during the interview with CNN. \"The Nazis killed people. Our Customs and Border Protection as you heard today are saving lives every day,\" Pence said.\n\nThe vice president also emphasized that the crisis at the southern border is not a \"manufactured crisis,\" but a real and overwhelming situation. To illustrate this, Pence and his team also visited an overcrowded facility for adult men, many of whom have been arrested multiple times. These men were in a temporary holding area because Democrats in Congress have refused to fund additional bed space.\n\nPence criticized CNN for not broadcasting the full story, stating that the network only played video of men in the temporary facility and did not show any footage of the family facility at all, ignoring the excellent care being provided to families and children.\n\nThe vice president's tweets concluded with a call for transparency and fairness, stating, \"Our great @CBP agents deserve better and the American people deserve the whole story from CNN!\"",
    " Title: Trump's Promise to Investigate Clinton's Email Scandal and the Double Standard in Government Prosecutions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of the latest presidential debate, a heated exchange between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton regarding the latter's private email server and emails has sparked a wave of commentary, with some pundits suggesting that Trump's call for a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton is a sign of his desire to turn America into a banana republic. However, this perspective overlooks the broader context and the real anger over the perceived double standard in government prosecutions.\n\nDuring the debate, Trump expressed his intention to instruct the Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor to look into Clinton's email scandal, citing her deletion of thousands of emails and the acid washing or bleach-bitting of devices as particularly egregious actions. Clinton responded by stating that it is good that someone with Trump's \"temperament\" is not in charge of the law in the United States, to which Trump retorted, \"Because you'd be in jail.\"\n\nThis exchange has led to a flurry of criticism, with some suggesting that Trump wants to jail his political enemies. However, it is important to note that Trump is not proposing to send Clinton to prison; rather, he is advocating for an investigation. Trump believes that the investigation will lead to Clinton's indictment, as he stated that she would be in jail as a result of this investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, the media has been preoccupied with Trump's controversial comments about women, while overlooking a significant development in a separate case. Jeffrey Hurant, the CEO of gay escort site Rentboy.com, pleaded guilty to federal charges of promoting prostitution and will not appeal the government's demand for $10 million in revenue the site had earned. Hurant is not accused of engaging in nonconsensual activity or human trafficking, but the government seized the site's profits.\n\nThe double standard in government prosecutions is further highlighted by Clinton's own statements during the debate, where she expressed her desire to have a special prosecutor examine trade deals between American companies and foreign countries. Clinton has previously stated that she wants a prosecutor who reports directly to the president to intervene in these trade cases, raising questions about potential targeting of countries or American businesses perceived as taking advantage of sweet deals.\n\nMoreover, Clinton's desire to overturn the Citizens United decision, which allows for privately funded political speech, could potentially lead to the criminalization of certain types of political speech. This, too, is a source of outrage that should not be overlooked.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is understandable to be outraged by Trump's threats to send the Justice Department after Clinton, it is important to recognize that he is merely advocating for an investigation, and that the real outrage should be focused on the double standard in government prosecutions and the potential erosion of free speech rights.",
    " Title: Philadelphia Safe Injection Site Clears Legal Hurdle, Moving Closer to Opening\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a landmark ruling, a federal judge has determined that a Philadelphia nonprofit's plan to establish a safe injection site does not violate federal drug laws, bringing the United States' first medically supervised heroin consumption facility one step closer to reality.\n\nThe Justice Department had argued that the proposed site, known as Safehouse, would contravene a decades-old law known as the \"crackhouse statute.\" However, Judge Gerald Austin McHugh ruled Wednesday that Safehouse aims to \"reduce drug use, not facilitate it.\"\n\nIn a statement issued late Wednesday, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen stated that the Justice Department would \"take all available steps to pursue further judicial review.\" Rosen added, \"Any attempt to open illicit drug injection sites in other jurisdictions while this case is pending will continue to be met with immediate action by the Department.\"\n\nThe Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Safehouse in February, coinciding with the identification of a location in Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood, home to one of the nation's largest open-air drug markets. U.S. Attorney William McSwain argued that Safehouse would be in violation of a part of the Controlled Substances Act, passed in the 1980s, that makes it illegal to operate facilities for the purpose of drug use or distribution.\n\nHowever, many cities and states are already in violation of the statute due to the legal marijuana boom and the proliferation of needle exchanges. McHugh noted that there is no evidence that lawmakers considered safe injection sites when writing the statute, as they were not popular at the time.\n\nSafehouse would not supply the drugs. Instead, it would provide a place for people to inject intravenous opioids with clean syringes, with medical personnel on hand to prevent overdoses. Participants could also access social services. This \"harm reduction\" strategy is favored by advocates and medical professionals, as it allows them to save the lives of people who are not yet ready to completely abandon drug use.\n\n\"Why would anybody want to arrest a bunch of doctors and nurses and board members who aren't getting paid with a laudable goal?\" former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, a Safehouse board member, told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News last year. As Philadelphia's mayor in the 1990s, he risked arrest to open a syringe exchange that was in violation of the crackhouse statute.\n\nThe Trump administration holds a different view, though. Last August, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein argued in an op-ed for The New York Times that safe injection sites would harm neighborhoods like Kensington. \"Injection sites destroy the surrounding community,\" he wrote. \"When drug users flock to a site, drug dealers follow, bringing with them violence and despair, posing a danger to neighbors and law-abiding visitors.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has repeatedly used the \"crackhouse statute\" to try to block or delay proposed sites around the country. With the opioid crisis still ongoing, ten countries\u2014including Canada, Australia, and Norway\u2014have safe injection sites, and several American cities have publicly considered them, including San Francisco, Seattle, and New York. However, these efforts\u2014including a plan to authorize safe injection sites in California\u2014have been hindered by warnings of legal action from the Trump administration.\n\n\"Philadelphia is being devastated. We've lost about three people a day,\" Ronda Goldfein, president of Safehouse, told NPR Wednesday. \"And we say we had to do something better and we couldn't sit back and let that death toll rise. And the court agreed with us.\"",
    " Title: Investigative Analysis: The DNC Hack, the FBI, and the Media: A Closer Look\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the complex landscape of American politics, the narrative surrounding the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack and the Antifa movement has raised questions about media bias and government bureaucracy at their worst.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has attributed the hack on DNC email accounts to Russia, leading to the publication of about 20,000 stolen emails on WikiLeaks. However, this finding, according to reports, was based largely on the DNC's unusual outsourcing of the investigation to a private cybersecurity firm. This arrangement, rarely seen in criminal investigations, has sparked controversy and raised questions about the legitimacy of the conclusion.\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, despite being labeled in various ways, has not been found to have lied about the origin of the leaked documents. Assange has maintained for over a year that the Russians did not provide him with the DNC emails.\n\nIntriguingly, when the emails were found to be compromised, then-DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz refused to allow FBI forensic detectives to examine the DNC server. This refusal, coupled with her subsequent efforts to protect her information-technology specialist, Imran Awan, from Capitol Police and FBI investigations, has fueled speculation about other potential actors involved in the hack.\n\nThe story of the DNC hack is still unfolding, and it may eventually reveal other actors beyond just the Russians.\n\nThe media's portrayal of James Comey, the former FBI director, as a dutiful and unjustly fired public servant has been challenged. A closer examination suggests that Comey may have been the most politicized, duplicitous, and out-of-control FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Comey, quite improperly, assumed the roles of prosecutor, judge, and jury in the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. This role proved disastrous, as Comey has admitted under oath to deliberately leaking his own notes to the media to prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\n\nComey's investigation of Clinton, which concluded that no prosecutable wrongdoing was found, was offered before he had even interviewed Clinton. This sequence of events suggests that Comey may have made ethical adjustments, assuming that the Obama administration would likely drop the inquiry.\n\nComey was also less than truthful when he testified that there were no internal FBI communications concerning the infamous meeting between Clinton's husband, former president Bill Clinton, and then-attorney general Loretta Lynch on an airport tarmac. In fact, there was a trail of FBI discussion about that supposedly secret rendezvous.\n\nBefore he was fired, Trump drafted a letter outlining his reasons for the termination. However, Trump's anguished letter focused more on Comey's private assurances that the president was not under FBI investigation, rather than on obstruction of justice.\n\nThe media's portrayal of the Antifa street protesters has also been questioned. Few have criticized their systematic use of violence. Antifa rioters in Charlottesville were praised by progressives for violently confronting a few dozen white supremacists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis. However, these supremacists were pathetic losers without any public or political support for their odious views, and they were condemned by both political parties.\n\nThe use of violence by Antifa was compared perversely by some progressives to American soldiers storming the beaches on D-Day. Later, Antifa thuggery in Boston and Berkeley against free speech and against conservative groups without ties to white supremacists confirmed that the movement was fascistic in nature.\n\nIt was recently disclosed that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security had warned the Obama administration in 2016 that Antifa was a domestic terrorist organization that aimed to incite violence during street protests. This stark assessment and Antifa's subsequent violence make the recent nonchalance of local police departments with regard to Antifa thuggery seem like an abject dereliction of duty.\n\nIn conclusion, doubts about the official narratives of the DNC leaks and the errant behavior of James Comey, and misinformation about the violent extremists of Antifa, illustrate media bias\u2014not to mention entrenched government bureaucracies that are either incompetent, ethically compromised, or completely politicized.",
    " Title: Secret Service Agents Under Investigation for Alleged Alcohol Impairment During White House Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nTwo Secret Service agents are under investigation following an incident on March 4, where they allegedly disrupted an investigation of an unattended package outside the White House while under the influence of alcohol, according to a report released by the Department of Homeland Security inspector general on Thursday.\n\nThe agents, identified as Marc Connolly, the deputy special agent in charge of the president's protective detail, and agent George Ogilvie, spent five hours at an Irish bar and restaurant less than a mile from the White House, celebrating a colleague's retirement, before driving into the scene of the investigation.\n\nThe report states that the agents' behavior was \"revealing\" and that Connolly, after leaving the bar, asked Ogilvie for a ride back to the White House. Upon arriving, Ogilvie drove his government-issued SUV past barriers that other agents had erected around the package they were investigating. His car passed \"within inches\" of the package, the report said.\n\nThe report also states that Ogilvie bought 14 drinks in three hours at the bar, while Connolly said he had just two beers. Two other Secret Service employees said they consumed three drinks that Ogilvie bought, and he told investigators he gave away the rest but couldn't remember to whom.\n\nThe findings are the latest in a series of embarrassments for the Secret Service, whose main job is to protect the U.S. president. The inspector general's office is investigating two more Secret Service incidents in March alone.\n\nIn one case, agents may have used agency computers to access the job application of Jason Chaffetz, now the U.S. House member who leads the committee with oversight responsibility for the service. In the other, a senior manager allegedly sexually assaulted a female subordinate after another farewell bash that involved drinking.\n\nChaffetz, a Utah Republican, and Maryland Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, said in a joint statement that the report's findings point to the need for a \"cultural overhaul\" within the Secret Service.\n\n\"It is sadly revealing that the watch commander felt it would be a'career killer' for him to administer a field sobriety test to a higher ranking agent, especially given concerns within the agency about potential retaliation for reporting misconduct,\" they said.\n\nSecret Service Director Joseph Clancy said in a statement, \"Behavior of the type described in the report is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.\" Connolly and Ogilvie have been placed on administrative leave, and the Secret Service's Office of Integrity has requested \"supporting information\" behind the inspector general's report. Once that information is reviewed, the service will propose disciplinary actions that the two agents can contest.\n\nConnolly has notified the Secret Service that he plans to retire, according to a government official who asked not to be identified.",
    " Title: Foreign Businesses Wary of Accusations Against Chinese Partners Amidst Industrial Espionage Allegations\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has raised concerns among foreign businesses, companies are hesitant to accuse their Chinese partners of intellectual property theft due to the fear of retaliation. Business groups representing these companies claim that Chinese firms leverage these corporate ties to coerce foreign partners into divulging trade secrets. Furthermore, Chinese officials are said to have pressured foreign companies to grant access to sensitive technology as part of a safety review process for products sold in China.\n\nForeign business groups highlight the renewable energy sector as an area where China has employed such tactics to foster domestic industries. For instance, in 2005, Beijing mandated that 70% of each wind turbine installed in China must be domestically manufactured. Spanish wind turbine leader, Gamesa, trained over 500 Chinese suppliers to manufacture components for its turbines, setting up a plant in Tianjin to assemble them. Other multinational wind turbine manufacturers followed suit.\n\nThe Obama administration questioned this policy as a violation of World Trade Organization rules, but by then, Chinese state-controlled enterprises had already begun assembling turbines using the same suppliers. Today, China is the world's largest market for wind turbines, with Chinese companies dominating the sector.\n\nA similar industrial evolution transpired in the solar energy sector soon after. China mandated that its first big municipal solar project only use solar panels that were at least 80% domestically produced. Companies rushed to produce in China and share technology. The Chinese government also heavily subsidized the manufacture of solar panels, primarily for export. Chinese companies now produce most of the world's solar panels.\n\nSome within the Trump administration fear a similar scenario unfolding in the automotive industry. Shortly after opening China to foreign auto companies, Chinese officials held a competition among global automakers to determine which would be allowed to enter the market.

For months, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has been considering a hybrid approach to Internet regulation, aiming to regulate the relationships between content companies and Internet service providers, while leaving the consumer side largely untouched. However, President Obama's strong endorsement of full net neutrality on Monday has added a new dimension to the debate.\n\nIn his statement, President Obama called on the FCC to reclassify wired and wireless broadband Internet as a \"common carrier\" service subject to strict government oversight. While the FCC is an independent agency, its response to the President's plan remains uncertain.\n\nFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's response on Monday provides some insight into the Commission's stance. Both the President and the FCC agree on the importance of an open Internet platform, where no players are advantaged over others. This means no \"fast lanes\" for those able to pay for content to be delivered more quickly, and no blocking or degradation of content delivery by Internet companies.\n\nHowever, the FCC seems to differ from the President in its enthusiasm for reclassifying Internet providers as \"common carriers.\" This classification would give the government the power to ensure that companies such as Comcast and Verizon treat all traffic that flows across their networks with evenhandedness. However, industry groups argue that such regulation could threaten the entrepreneurial spirit that led to the growth of the Internet in the first place, as government regulation could stifle innovation.\n\nIn his statement, Wheeler acknowledged that common-carrier reclassification \"brings with it policy issues that run the gamut from privacy to universal service to the ability of federal agencies to protect consumers.\" This suggests that the FCC needs more time to consider whether reclassifying Internet providers\u2014including mobile providers such as T-Mobile\u2014as common carriers, subject to increased government regulation, is truly in the best interest of consumers.\n\nThe FCC also wants to ensure its case is legally airtight before announcing any rule changes. The Commission's 2010 Open Internet Rules, which made demands on Internet providers that are similar to what's on the table now, were struck down by the D.C. Circuit Court in January because the FCC wasn't able to prove it had the authority to impose those requirements. Reclassifying broadband providers as common carriers would be one way to establish that authority, but the Commission would need to prove that this change will benefit consumers and the Internet as a whole.\n\nWheeler emphasized the need for more time to examine the issue, stating that the FCC needs \"more time to examine these issues to ensure that whatever approach is taken, it can withstand any legal challenges it may face.\" The FCC's decision will have significant implications for the future of the Internet, and the public can expect a thorough and thoughtful approach from the Commission as it moves forward.",
    " Title: G7 Foreign Ministers Coordinate Effort to Pressure Russia Over Syria\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant move, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, along with six other G7 foreign ministers, is aiming to send a \"clear and coordinated message\" to Russia regarding its continued support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The push comes in the aftermath of a nerve gas attack in Syria that left numerous casualties and the subsequent U.S. airstrikes on a Syrian airbase.\n\nThe U.S., following the airstrikes, received broad support from Europe. Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, who is hosting the meeting, noted that the missile strike had contributed to a \"renewed harmony\" between the U.S. and its partners, marking a positive shift in relations since President Trump took office.\n\n\"We need to remember that not 10 years ago, but 100 or 120 days ago, the concern in Europe was that the United States and the EU were moving apart,\" Alfano told Sky TG24 Sunday. \"I welcome this renewed harmony.\"\n\nDespite this apparent improvement in U.S.-Europe relations, there has been no indication that President Vladimir Putin is planning to alter his stance on the Assad regime in Syria. Russia and Iran issued a joint statement Sunday, stating that they would \"respond to any aggression\" in response to the U.S. airstrikes in Syria.\n\n\"What America waged in an aggression on Syria is a crossing of red lines,\" the countries said, according to The Sun. \"From now on we will respond with force to any aggressor or any breach of red lines from whoever it is and America knows our ability to respond well.\"\n\nH.R. McMaster, President Trump's national security adviser, stated in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday\" that Russia should reconsider its support for Assad. McMaster added that Russia will have to decide whether it wants to continue backing a \"murderous regime\" as President Trump weighs the next steps against Syria.\n\nTillerson is expected to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov after the G7 meeting. The discussions will likely focus on the ongoing conflict in Syria and the international community's efforts to find a peaceful resolution.",
    " Title: U.S. Elections and Foreign Policy: A Neutral Perspective\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent interview, renowned historian and political analyst Vijay Prashad discussed the implications of the upcoming U.S. elections on both domestic and foreign policy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And what do the U.S. elections mean for what's taking place now?\n\nVIJAY PRASHAD: Well, it's clear from your news report at the beginning that, in domestic terms, there is a great difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump has not only been associated with white nationalists, but he himself appears to be a white nationalist. However, seen from the rest of the world, the difference between the two is minimal.\n\nYou have Donald Trump, who is, in many ways, erratic. The extent of his actions once he becomes president is uncertain. He will lead a party that, in some ways, seems to embrace figures like Ted Cruz, who has expressed a desire to bomb Syria, potentially irradiating the desert.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Do you think God knows what he'll do once he becomes president?\n\nVIJAY PRASHAD: Yes, I think God knows what he'll do. If the Republican Party can see someone like Ted Cruz as normal, as rational, then, you know, God help us if the Republicans are in charge of things.\n\nBut let's take the case of Hillary Clinton. Here's somebody who actually pushed Obama to enter the Libyan operation. Obama was reticent to enter the operation in Libya. The French were very eager. And Hillary Clinton led the charge against Libya. This shows, to my mind, a profound dangerous tendency to go into wars overseas, you know, damn the consequences.\n\nAnd I think, therefore, if you're looking at this from outside the United States, there's a real reason to be terrified that whoever becomes president\u2014as Medea Benjamin put it to me in an interview\u2014whoever wins the presidency, there will be a hawk in the White House.",
    " Title: Republicans Struggle to Address Minimum Wage Issue, Citing Misunderstandings and Insensitivity\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate over the federal minimum wage, Democrats have been pressing Republicans to take clear positions on the issue this year, with most GOP candidates and officeholders expressing opposition to raising the federal minimum wage above its current level of $7.25 an hour. This stance has been met with criticism, as some Republicans, such as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, have faced backlash for their comments on the issue, which have been perceived as callous and clueless.\n\nDuring a speech before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Christie made headlines for his comments on the minimum wage. \"I'm tired of hearing about the minimum wage,\" Christie said, according to The Hill. \"I really am. I don't think there's a mother or a father sitting around the kitchen table tonight in America saying, \u2018 You know, honey, if our son or daughter could just make a higher minimum wage, my God, all of our dreams would be realized.' \"\n\nChristie's remarks were met with criticism for their tone-deafness, as many workers are forced to take minimum wage jobs due to a dismal labor market. While Christie argued that most parents aspire to more for their children, his comments were seen as a missed opportunity to address the struggles of low-wage workers and the need for policies to address income inequality.\n\nWalker, who is facing a tough reelection battle in Wisconsin against Democrat Mary Burke, has also faced criticism for his stance on the minimum wage. Earlier this month, his administration rebuffed a workers' coalition's effort to raise the state's minimum wage in accordance with a state law that calls for the minimum to be a \"living wage.\" The administration responded to their effort by asserting that $7.25 an hour is a living wage, despite MIT calculations showing that a single parent would need to earn $21.17 an hour to make a living wage in the state capital of Madison.\n\nWalker's comments on the minimum wage have been met with criticism for their lack of accuracy and sensitivity. Last week, Walker stated that the minimum wage does not \"serve a purpose,\" explaining that he'd rather help Wisconsinites secure higher-paying jobs than raise the minimum wage. However, a raise to $10.10 an hour would benefit over 500,000 workers in the state.\n\nThe Republican Party's approach to the minimum wage has been criticized for its lack of empathy and understanding of the struggles of low-wage workers. While some Republicans argue that minimum wage hikes do not lead to job growth, others have been accused of perpetuating stereotypes about minimum wage earners, such as Joni Ernst's claim that most minimum wage earners are high school students who just need a \"starter wage.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the ongoing debate over the minimum wage has highlighted the stark differences between the two major parties in the United States. While Democrats have been pushing for a raise in the federal minimum wage, Republicans have been met with criticism for their tone-deaf and insensitive comments on the issue. As the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether the GOP will be able to address the concerns of low-wage workers in a more empathetic and fact-based manner.",
    " Title: President Trump Accuses Democrats of Meddling in Midterm Elections Amidst Ongoing Russia Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, President Donald Trump accused Democrats of meddling in the upcoming midterm elections by continuing the Russia investigation. The President's tweets came as the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election enters its second year without a clear conclusion.\n\n\"The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!\" Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nThe President went on to question why the Democrats were not investigating the \"totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton.\" He referred to the investigation as a \"Rigged Witch Hunt\" and asked if they enjoyed her after-election celebration.\n\n\"Sorry, I\u2019ve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe special counsel's investigation, led by Robert Mueller, has been underway for just over a year, but it's unclear when it may conclude. The President's tweets come as the midterm elections approach, with Republicans currently leading in many polls. The investigation has been a source of controversy and division, with some Democrats accusing the President of obstructing justice and some Republicans claiming the investigation is a politically motivated witch hunt.",
    " Title: Pew Report Reveals Political Polarization in American Attitudes Toward Climate Change and Science\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report released by the Pew Research Center on Wednesday has shed light on the political polarization in America regarding climate change and other scientific issues. The report, which surveyed 2,002 adults in 2014, found that global warming is one of the issues most sharply divided across party lines, along with other climate and energy issues such as offshore drilling, fracking, and nuclear power.\n\nThe report reveals that only 27 percent of Republicans believe the Earth is warming due to human activity, compared to 71 percent of Democrats. This trend of political polarization has been growing over the past two decades, with party identification being a more significant determinant of a respondent's stance than even their level of education or scientific knowledge.\n\nHowever, the report also found that politics was not the only factor at play. Respondents with a greater understanding of science proved less afraid of scientific advancements and futuristic-sounding technologies. They were more likely to support using animals in scientific research, approve of expanding nuclear power, and consider genetically modified foods safe to eat. They were \"especially likely\" to approve using bioengineered organs for human transplant.\n\nInterestingly, the report also found that religion played a central role in determining people's stances on some scientific topics, particularly evolution. However, this was not the case for other scientific topics, such as the safety of eating GMO foods, space travel, animal research, and biomedicine.\n\nOne surprising correlation found in the report was that the majority of both parties\u201483 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of Republicans\u2014said government investment in scientific research paid off in the long run. This suggests a shared belief in the importance of scientific research, despite political differences on specific issues.\n\nThe Pew report serves as a reminder of the need for continued education and dialogue on scientific issues, as political leanings can significantly influence people's attitudes and beliefs. The report also highlights the importance of separating political ideology from scientific facts and evidence.",
    " Title: Washington Post Criticized for Placing Story on Kavanaugh Coaching Basketball in \"Public Safety\" Category\n\nThe Washington Post has come under fire for categorizing a story about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh returning to coach his daughter's basketball team under the \"public safety\" section. The story, which was published over the Thanksgiving weekend, was placed above a story about a 6-year-old child struck by a bus in Charles County, Maryland.\n\nThe story, written by a Post author who has previously covered Kavanaugh, was automatically defaulted to the public safety category, according to a spokesperson for The Washington Post. The spokesperson stated that the story should not have been placed under that category and it would no longer appear there.\n\nThe story is still visible on a page cataloging the Post's public safety stories, but is not categorized as \"local.\" The placement of the story in the public safety section has drawn criticism from conservatives, who argue that it is inappropriate and sensationalized.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) was the only Democrat to vote to confirm Kavanaugh, who was confirmed by the Senate on Oct. 5, 2018, mostly along party lines. The controversy surrounding Kavanaugh's confirmation, which included allegations of sexual misconduct, has continued to generate headlines and debate.\n\nThe Washington Post has not yet issued a statement regarding the criticism of the story's placement. The controversy highlights the ongoing debate over the role of media in shaping public opinion and the potential for bias in news reporting.",
    " Title: Tom Steyer's $100 Million Climate Change Campaign: A Potential Game-Changer for 2016 Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that could significantly reshape the political landscape, California billionaire Tom Steyer has announced plans to invest $100 million in the 2014 midterm elections, with a focus on making climate change a key issue in several key races. However, sources familiar with Steyer's strategy suggest that this figure could potentially increase, making it a significant force in the upcoming elections.\n\nSteyer's strategy involves targeting Senate and gubernatorial races in Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida, and possibly Pennsylvania - all crucial battlegrounds in the 2016 presidential race. This approach marks a shift from his earlier efforts to support individual Democrats and address specific issues like the Keystone XL pipeline. Instead, Steyer aims to elevate his signature climate cause to a central role in the next presidential election.\n\nBetsy Taylor, a climate donor and leader of a network of wealthy climate donors, described Steyer's operation as \"aggressive\" and \"fearless.\" She noted that Steyer's approach differs from that of mainstream environmental groups, as he is not concerned with access to Democratic Party leadership.\n\nWhile Steyer has yet to reveal specific details about how he will allocate his campaign war chest through his NextGen Climate Action super PAC, his strategy could position him as a counterweight to big conservative donors like the Koch brothers. However, it remains unclear how far $100 million will go in the post-Citizens United world, or whether climate change can compete with issues like jobs and the Affordable Care Act on the presidential campaign trail.\n\nSteyer's strategy includes influencing Senate races in Iowa and New Hampshire, the gubernatorial contest in Florida, and potentially the governor's race in Pennsylvania, where former Bill Clinton environmental aide Katie McGinty is among the Democrats vying to unseat Republican incumbent Tom Corbett.\n\nIn Florida, Steyer's focus on climate change could be particularly impactful, given the state's vulnerability to sea-level rise. Republican Governor Rick Scott, a potential opponent of Steyer's, has previously stated that he does not believe that humans are causing climate change. Democratic challenger Charlie Crist, who has been a vocal critic of climate change, may benefit from Steyer's financial support.\n\nSteyer's strategy also targets states that are significant in determining whether Democrats can maintain control of the Senate in 2014, including Iowa and New Hampshire. Additionally, he aims to sway governor's races in states where the winner could take action on climate change without waiting for federal approval, potentially leading him to invest in Pennsylvania to support Katie McGinty or other Democratic gubernatorial candidates.\n\nDuring a gathering of wealthy climate donors at Steyer's ranch in early February, Steyer and his PAC's chief strategist, Chris Lehane, outlined the approach. The event included a briefing on potential climate change effects from Columbia University climate researcher James Hansen, as well as fellow billionaires and some of Steyer's oldest friends from the financial community.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Monday that Steyer's goal is to spend about $50 million of his own money and raise another $50 million from green-minded donors for the 2014 elections. However, NextGen officials clarified on Tuesday that $100 million is not the ceiling for what Steyer's PAC may spend this year.\n\nAs the 2014 elections approach, Steyer's climate change campaign could prove to be a significant factor in shaping the political landscape, particularly in key races and states.",
    " Title: Study Reveals Potential Misuse of Tax Credits by Illegal Immigrants, Raising Questions About IRS Oversight\n\nArticle:\n\nA new report released by the Center for Immigration Studies on Monday suggests that billions of dollars in tax credits were paid out to illegal immigrants in 2010, with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) distributing $4.2 billion using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN), a common indicator of an illegal immigrant. The study, authored by CIS fellow David North, claims that the issue is a result of a tax credit expanding beyond its initial scope and mid-level IRS managers manipulating the law, leading to billions of dollars being funneled to illegal immigrants.\n\nThe report alleges that the decision to allow illegal immigrants to collect the tax credit was not made by top IRS leaders, and it was not the intent of Congress. David North, the report's author, stated, \"I've been in government, and I know how these things work out. It struck me that [GS-] 15s, 16s, got together at some point and decided this is how we should handle it, and it stuck.\"\n\nDuring the government shutdown, which began on October 1, the IRS was unavailable for comment. In the past, the agency has maintained that it does not have the legal authority to deny the tax credit to illegal immigrants or to deny claims without supporting documentation showing that the children reside in the U.S.\n\nThe \"Additional Child Tax Credit\" (ACTC) was created to assist those who earn too little to qualify for the full child tax credit. The ACTC is refundable, meaning that even if the taxpayer does not owe income tax, they could still receive a payout from the IRS. This setup has been exploited, particularly when combined with illegal immigrant workers, whose use of the tax credit increased from 796,000 filers in 2005 to 1.5 million in 2008 and 2.3 million in 2010, according to the IRS's official auditor.\n\nThe IRS has attempted to limit the issuance of ITINs to curb fraudulent tax credit payouts. ITINs are now valid for only five years, and a stricter review of identity documents is required. However, abuses persist for existing ITINs, according to the report.\n\nInvestigators identified one address in Atlanta where 23,994 ITIN-related tax refunds were sent, including 8,393 refunds deposited to a single bank account. Mr. North considered these strong indicators of fraud. He also suggested that the IRS should look for cases where an ITIN filer goes from claiming no dependents to claiming four or five dependents the next year.\n\nMr. North used an auditor's report to identify a town in Delaware and another on Virginia's Eastern Shore with large concentrations of ITIN filers. Frankford, Del., had one address where 627 ITINs were registered, despite the town having a population of just 862. Parksley, Va., had a single address with 100 ITINs registered, in a town of 847 residents. Mr. North visited both towns and found that while Frankford seemed oblivious to the situation, Parksley was different. One tax counselor in town told him she suspected a rival business was responsible for the ITIN applications.\n\nThe study raises questions about the oversight and management of tax credits by the IRS and the potential for fraudulent activity involving illegal immigrants. The IRS has yet to respond to these allegations.",
    " Title: White House and Congressional Leaders Differ on Impact and Approach to Federal Spending Cuts\n\nArticle:\n\nAs the $85 billion in federal spending cuts enter a second week, the White House and Republican leaders appear to be at odds over the impact of the cuts and the best approach to limit government spending and hold down taxes. Gene Sperling, the White House's top economic adviser, stated on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the cuts will not have a significant impact immediately but will over the long term.\n\nSperling's remarks contrast with weeks of warnings from President Obama and his Cabinet that the cuts could result in furloughs or pay cuts for middle-class wage-earners such as teachers, Capitol Hill janitors, and air traffic controllers, potentially causing 90-minute delays at major U.S. airports.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, in an interview with CNN's \"State of the Union,\" argued that the cuts are similar to the average American's pay decrease when the payroll tax holiday expired. The cuts, known as sequester, were agreed upon in 2011 after Congress failed to agree on more specific reductions to defense and some domestic spending.\n\nHowever, Sperling rejected several Republican-backed plans and stated that no compromise would be reached unless the party agrees to tax increases. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., responded by suggesting potential pay freezes for federal employees and reforms to the federal food stamps program.\n\nSperling hinted at Democrats' likely strategy for retaking the House in 2014, stating, \"Our hope is as more Republicans start to see this pain in their own districts, they will choose bipartisan compromise over this absolutist position.\"\n\nThe billions in cuts apply to the remainder of fiscal 2013, which ends on September 30. Without a deal, the cuts will continue to slash government spending by about $1 trillion over a 10-year period. The looming March 27 deadline could potentially lead to a government shutdown, and a debt-ceiling clash is expected in May. House Speaker John Boehner stated that his chamber would move this week to pass a measure to keep government open through September 30. McConnell stated a government shutdown was unlikely to come from his side of Capitol Hill. The White House has stated it would avoid a shutdown and roll back the cuts, which hit domestic and defense spending in equal share.\n\nSperling also addressed an email sent to Bob Woodward in which he said The Washington Post reporter might \"regret\" writing a story that said Obama has \"moved the goal posts\" on sequester. He told ABC that he and Woodward share a mutual respect and he hopes they can \"put this behind us.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., stated that any tax increases were unacceptable. \"I'm not going to do any more small deals,\" he said. \"I'm not going to raise taxes to fix sequestration. We don't need to raise taxes to fund the government.\"",
    " Title: Global Economic Downturn Deepens as Job Growth Stalls in U.S. and Europe\n\nArticle:\n\nThe global economic downturn has deepened as job growth stalled in the United States and Europe, with financial markets showing signs of weakness on Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.22 percent, erasing its gains for the year, and the German stock market closed down 3.4 percent.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield fell to another record low of 1.46 percent, and the German two-year bond fell below zero, as investors sought safety in government bonds. The slowing growth in China and India, coupled with Europe's debt crisis, has contributed to the global economic malaise.\n\nSteve Blitz, chief economist of ITG Investment Research, stated that the big improvements over the winter were not a true acceleration but simply a catch-up after last year's dip. He added that the underlying pace of the domestic economy is a slog, driven by manufacturing and restrained by slackening global demand.\n\nUncertainty has become a dominant theme, with manufacturers expressing concern about Europe's debt crisis and its potential impact on global growth. Ellen Zentner, the senior United States economist for Nomura, a financial services firm, said, \"Manufacturers are very concerned about Europe because a blowup in Europe means a global slowdown.\"\n\nDespite the gloomy jobs report, some companies are still hiring, but with caution. Charles Ingram, vice president for marketing and sales at Eriez Magnetics, which produces industrial equipment, said the company was still hiring and still getting orders, but was watching developments closely.\n\nRepublicans seized upon the jobs numbers as an opportunity to criticize President Obama's economic policies, with Mitt Romney calling the report a \"harsh indictment of the president's handling of the economy\" and \"devastating news for American workers and American families.\" The White House emphasized that the report showed the 27th month of job gains and called on Congress to pass the president's numerous job-related proposals.\n\nThe May jobs report showed gains in health care, transportation and warehousing, and wholesale trade, while construction jobs fell by a seasonally adjusted 28,000. Even some bright spots, like booming auto sales, failed to meet expectations or to bolster manufacturing employment by much\u2014only 12,000 jobs.\n\nGovernment cutbacks also contributed to the job losses, with \"In February or March, I thought the labor market had achieved escape velocity,\" said Patrick J. O' Keefe, the director of economic research at J. H. Cohn, a consulting firm. \"It appears to me now that that was a premature call.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve could choose to step up its stimulus campaign in response to the weak jobs report. The economy needs to grow by about 125,000 jobs each month just to maintain the current unemployment rate. When the Fed committee next meets, in late June, it will face the possibility that the recovery has failed once again to take off.\n\nFears of a global slowdown showed up in other economic data on Friday, with cooling exports dampening the nation's major manufacturing index, though it remained in positive territory. The jobs report is based on two surveys, one of businesses and the other of households. The household survey showed a net gain of 422,000 in the number of people employed, and also an uptick in the percentage of the working-age population who have jobs.\n\nHowever, David Rosenberg, the chief economist with Gluskin Sheff, an investment firm, said much of that gain was in part-time work, while the number of full-time workers fell. \"Even the good news in this report was bad,\" he said.\n\nSome analysts said it was too soon to declare a significant slowdown. The recovery's roller-coaster trajectory may be largely illusory, the product of seasonal adjustment distortions and, this year, the unusually warm winter. Many economists say the weather effect, which caused some growth to occur earlier in the year than it otherwise would have, should be over by now.\n\nThe number of long-term unemployed, those who have been looking for work for more than half a year, rose by 300,000, even as hundreds of thousands of jobless workers lost their unemployment checks because of cutbacks. The long-term unemployed have the most difficulty finding jobs, and many of them say they have not seen any improvement in the job market.\n\n\"Nobody has lists and lists of hundreds of available jobs,\" said Glen Barry of Carmel, N.Y., who worked for the government at the county level for 25 years as a computer operator and was laid off in December 2010. \"A lot of people work a job and a half now. Instead of having four people doing the work, they have two people doing the work.\"",
    " Title: Trump Announces Indefinite Continuation of White House Coronavirus Task Force, Shifts Focus to Reopening and Vaccine Production\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 In a sudden turn of events, President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the White House Coronavirus Task Force, initially established in January to coordinate the response to the virus, will continue indefinitely, with a new focus on reopening the nation's economy and vaccine production.\n\nTrump's latest decision on the task force came a day after Vice President Mike Pence and other officials indicated that the group's work would be transferred to federal agencies as early as this month. The sudden change in strategy drew criticism from some quarters who felt it was premature to disband the group amidst the ongoing pandemic.\n\nThe president left the composition of the task force and its focus somewhat unclear. Trump suggested that he may remove some members and add others, without specifying who would be affected. He emphasized that the group's focus would shift to safety, reopening the economy, and vaccine production.\n\n\"The Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY & OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN,\" Trump tweeted on Wednesday. \"The Task Force will also be very focused on Vaccines & Therapeutics. Thank you!\"\n\nDuring a trip to Arizona on Tuesday, Trump seemed to link the decision to disband the group with his broader desire to reopen the nation and recharge its economy. He suggested that winding down the group signaled a new phase in the government's response to the virus.\n\n\"I'm viewing our great citizens of this country to a certain extent and to a large extent as warriors,\" Trump said when asked about the task force. \"Will some people be affected, badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open.\"\n\nDemocrats and other critics criticized Trump's plan to reduce the scope of the task force on Tuesday, especially given the threat that the death toll would rise as states reopen businesses and other parts of their economies. The virus has claimed more than 70,000 American lives, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, criticized Trump's decision, saying, \"President Trump waves the white flag of surrender and winds down his \u2018 task force.' As the death toll soars, it is the task force that gets buried.\"\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the former Democratic presidential candidate, slammed the decision as a \"true American tragedy\" and predicted that \"thousands will unnecessarily die\" because of Trump's \"contempt for science.\"\n\nWhile the number of new daily cases has slowed, it still remains high. The ongoing pandemic continues to pose significant challenges for the nation, and the role of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, whether in its current form or a modified one, will be crucial in navigating these challenges.",
    " Title: Centrist Shift: Libertarian Ticket Gains Momentum Among Moderate Republicans\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Senator Susan Collins of Maine has joined the ranks of other prominent Republicans, such as Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush, in considering a vote for the Libertarian ticket, led by former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson and former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld. This development marks a shift in the political landscape, as the Libertarian Party, traditionally associated with the rightmost precincts, is now gaining traction among moderate Republicans.\n\nCollins, a veteran centrist, expressed her dismay with the choices of Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, and joined Romney in praising Weld, with whom she has worked on various projects. This trend, which might have been unimaginable a year ago, is indicative of a pattern that is beginning to emerge in 2016 politics.\n\nThe Johnson-Weld campaign has been striking a theme of moderation, positioning itself as the \"sane\" and \"responsible\" choice, and the \"adult\" ticket. They are campaigning not on fear and anger but on a positive message of problem-solving, a stark contrast to the bickering and shouting of Trump and Clinton.\n\nThis shift in the Libertarian Party's positioning, from the far right to the center, is a departure from past libertarian campaigns in the US. While the Libertarian ticket has been drawing an unprecedented 8-10 percent in national polls, little of its energy comes from the Republican base. Instead, it is making noticeable gains in the center.\n\nThe Johnson-Weld campaign's emphasis on moderation and problem-solving resonates with many voters who are disillusioned with the polarized political climate. As a more or less lifelong libertarian, I find myself getting used to the idea of the libertarian party being the middle position in an election, the oasis of sanity, the haven from extremism.\n\nLibertarians, with their commitment to upholding rights for all and a strong rule of law, can serve as a balance wheel against the politics of factional revenge. In Europe, liberal parties, often seen as the nearest analogue of libertarian, are often perceived as occupying centrist or middle positions between labor or revolutionary parties on the left and blood-and-soil or religious parties on the right.\n\nThe reaction from many libertarian and conservative quarters to Collins's comments was revealing: a groan. After all, Collins has a not-very-libertarian voting record in the Senate. If she would consider a vote for Johnson and Weld, does this not prove they're sellouts?\n\nHowever, as David Frum once said in another context, if you find yourself under the same party roof with someone who agrees with you on basically nothing, congratulations! That's how parties win in the United States, by assembling different kinds of people who come in for entirely different reasons. Instead of apologizing for more-or-less libertarian candidates who can win votes from non-libertarians, we should study them.\n\nThe future of the Libertarian Party remains uncertain, but its shift towards the center could signal a broader realignment in US politics. The wider significance may come after November, when it comes time to pick up the pieces, whether or not as part of a broader party realignment. It'll play out in how libertarian ideas are regarded by others\u2014and in how libertarians regard themselves.",
    " Title: U.S. Job Growth Slows, Unemployment Rate Drops, but Wage Growth Remains Sluggish\n\nIn a recent report, the U.S. economy added 164,000 jobs in April, marking a slight decrease from the monthly average of 191,000 over the past year. This slowdown in hiring is being attributed to employers' increasing difficulty in finding new workers. The unemployment rate also fell to 3.9% in April, down from 4.1% for six consecutive months.\n\nThe decline in the unemployment rate is partly due to a decrease in the labor force participation rate, which some economists interpret as a sign of decreased job optimism among the population. However, economists expect the unemployment rate to continue falling further in the coming months, with the Federal Reserve forecasting a rate of 3.6% next year.\n\nDespite the tightening labor market, wage growth remains sluggish, with wages rising 2.6% from a year earlier in April. This slow wage growth has confounded many policymakers and investors who expected the tight labor market to force employers to raise wages to secure workers.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's response to the report is expected to remain unchanged, with the central bank set to lift rates next month and consider one or two more increases later in the year. The report shows the economy is generally strong, but inflation is not getting out of hand, which is good enough for the central bank to continue its tightening policy.\n\nInvestors' reactions to the jobs report are becoming increasingly difficult to interpret, with the WSJ Dollar Index jumping after the report, typically a sign of a strong report, but benchmark Treasury yields falling, suggesting some investors see weakness in the numbers. This trend has been observed in recent jobs reports, as the economy enters the later stages of its cycle.",
    " Title: Senator Bernie Sanders Proposes Expansion of Estate Tax, Countering Senate Republicans' Elimination Efforts\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that signals a renewed focus on wealth inequality, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont lawmaker and potential 2020 presidential candidate, has unveiled a proposal to significantly expand the estate tax, a levy that has diminished over the years. This proposal, dubbed the \"For the 99.8 Percent Act,\" aims to leave the majority of estates untaxed while implementing a graduated rate structure for the estates of the extremely wealthy, with a maximum rate of 77 percent.\n\nSanders' plan, in essence, mirrors Senator Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax proposal, although the specifics of implementation differ. Both proposals aim to generate revenue from the wealthiest Americans and curb the accumulation of vast dynastic wealth.\n\nThe estate tax, until recently, allowed wealthy individuals to pass down $5.5 million untaxed to their heirs. The 2017 Trump tax bill doubled this exemption to $11 million. This week, Senate Republicans introduced legislation to eliminate the estate tax entirely, potentially allowing billions to pass tax-free from today's wealthy individuals to their children.\n\nSanders' revised proposal, which follows a lower top rate in his 2016 plan, would establish a multi-tiered structure for taxing the largest estates, including:\n\n- A 55 percent bracket on wealth from $50 million to $1 billion\n- A 50 percent bracket from $10 million to $50 million\n- A 45 percent bracket from $3.5 million to $10 million\n\nWhile the majority of Americans do not inherit such substantial sums, these relatively high rates would significantly impact the tax liability of the wealthiest American families. For instance, Sanders' staff estimates that Warren Buffett's tax liability would nearly double, from $33 billion to $64 billion.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, Sanders' proposal aims to raise revenue from the wealthiest Americans and dismantle the large fortunes that enable a small number of extremely wealthy individuals to exert disproportionate political influence.\n\nConservatives often argue against estate taxes, or \"death taxes,\" by citing the supposed challenges faced by family farmers and other owners of illiquid assets. However, the real policy argument from the right is that wealth taxes are a particularly harmful form of taxation because, over the long term, the accumulation of capital is crucial to productivity and economic growth, and taxing wealth discourages this.\n\nSanders' staff estimates that his proposal would generate approximately $2.2 trillion in a 10-year window, although the exact nature of the window is uncertain due to the impact of his plan being highly sensitive to the deaths of a small number of ultra-wealthy individuals.\n\nIn contrast, Warren's wealth tax proposal would levy an annual fee of 2 to 3 percent on large fortunes, and her team estimates it will raise $2.7 trillion in a standard Congressional Budget Office 10-year scoring window.\n\nThese numbers are similar, reflecting the fact that these are essentially two different ways to achieve the same goal. Warren's plan, by taxing large fortunes at a steady pace rather than in a single large spurt upon death, has the advantage of being less sensitive to timing issues, while Sanders' plan may be more effective in preventing the emergence of an entrenched oligarchy.\n\nOn a more substantive level, experts in tax avoidance have, in recent years, tended to favor the wealth tax direction as potentially easier to enforce. However, under either scheme, the avoidance issue is likely to come down to intricate details that neither senator has yet to delve into.\n\nIn summary, the left wing of the Democratic Party appears eager to tax the rich, but has not yet reached a consensus on the best method to achieve this goal. The dueling plans of Sanders and Warren underscore this ongoing debate within the party.",
    " Title: Trump Nominates Rick Perry for Energy Secretary Despite Previous Call to Eliminate Department\n\nArticle:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has reportedly chosen former Texas Governor Rick Perry to serve as the Secretary of Energy, according to reports by CBS News and NBC News. The nomination comes despite Perry's previous call to eliminate the department he is now set to lead.\n\nPerry, who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, beat out two other contenders for the Cabinet post: Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat representing West Virginia, and Ray Washburne, a Dallas investor working in oil and gas operations, according to CBS News.\n\nDuring a meeting at Trump Towers on Monday, Perry declined to take questions from reporters. The Energy Department is the same federal agency Perry once proposed eliminating, a move he infamously forgot during a 2011 Republican presidential primary debate when he could not recall the name of the third department he intended to eliminate, alongside Commerce and Education.\n\nPerry's nomination comes despite his ties to the Dakota Access pipeline battle. He sits on the corporate board for Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Dakota Access LLC, which is pushing to build the pipeline. The Obama administration blocked the Dakota Access Pipeline easement through Lake Oahe, but the Trump administration is expected to take a different approach.\n\nTrump, who has previously invested in Energy Transfer Partners and supports the pipeline, told Fox News Sunday he would intervene if the conflict isn't resolved by his inauguration. The president-elect's nomination of Perry is a significant move, as it signals his commitment to energy policies that prioritize domestic oil and gas production.",
    " Title: The Unprecedented Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy: Brexit and the Struggle for a Solution\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the heart of London, the British Parliament is grappling with an unprecedented crisis, as the Brexit saga continues to unfold. This week, Prime Minister Theresa May submitted her negotiated deal for withdrawal from the European Union to Parliament, a move that has defined her premiership. The deal, however, was met with a resounding rejection, with a vote of 432 to 202.\n\nHistorians are searching for a parallel example of a government's business being so viciously rejected by Parliament. Losses by 60 votes or 90 votes have traditionally led to prime ministers resigning or triggering no-confidence votes. Yet, despite the overwhelming rejection of her government's main piece of legislation, the most important bill in decades, Theresa May managed to win the no-confidence vote.\n\nThe current situation in Westminster is a complex web of two intertwined crises. The first is a crisis of responsibility within Parliament. Theresa May's deal may not be what hard Brexiteers wanted, but they lack the votes and the courage to oust May and expose their own Brexit to parliamentary and public criticism. They also do not have the votes in Parliament to pass their preferred terms. By rejecting a deal that has been negotiated with over two dozen other European heads of state, with the clock ticking down, their rejection of their party leader's deal increases the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit at the end of March or a delay or cancellation of Brexit altogether, potentially leading to another national referendum on the issue.\n\nThe second crisis underlies the first. In the U.K. system, Parliament is supposed to be sovereign. However, Brexit was won by a national referendum, against the tide of media and parliamentary consensus. This result seemed to give the cause of Brexit a superior form of popular legitimacy. Yet, many Tory and Labour MPs, despite running on election manifestos committing themselves to delivering Brexit, are against the project altogether. They hope to show that Brexit is harmful or \"impossible\" in some way, thinking that the passage of time will increase an ascendant majority for Remain.\n\nThe rejection of May's deal at this late stage is a risky move, as a second referendum would likely yield the same result: a narrow majority for Leave and a reluctant Parliament. Failing to deliver on Brexit at all could do irreparable harm to the Tory party and the government's democratic legitimacy.\n\nTheresa May, to her credit, is not deluding herself into thinking she can save this deal. She is essentially putting herself in Parliament's hands and trying to discover what kind of deal can actually command a majority. The going assumption, fed by reports from Germany, is that a delay of Article 50's ejection of the U.K. from the EU can be had.\n\nHowever, even after such a delay, Parliament may discover that it has no working political majority willing to stand behind any Brexit. Northern Irish ministers don't want Northern Ireland to be treated differently and may be willing to tolerate the U.K. remaining in the customs union. English Brexiteers despair of being in a customs union if the U.K. loses its ability to shape the rules, thinking it vassalage. The Labour party is led by a not-so-secret Red Brexiteer, Jeremy Corbyn. The overwhelming political lagoon forces Labour to reject every May-negotiated Brexit as ruinous, trying to please their Remain and Leave constituencies at the same time.\n\nAn unprecedented opportunity to reshape the laws and regulations governing the U.K. economy is being squandered. Currently, a solution to these twin crises is not within sight. Parliament has voted for its confidence in May's leadership and demonstrated that it has none. Pretend confidence. Pretend governance. But there is no way to keep pretending. The U.K. must Leave or Remain, and it is up to Parliament to decide when and how.",
    " Title: \"Rep. Paul Ryan's Dissent Against Government Shutdown Tactic in Healthcare Debate\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) has distanced himself from the idea of shutting down the government as a means to repeal President Obama's healthcare law, a tactic that has been advocated by some Republicans, such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). In an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Ryan expressed his opposition to this strategy, stating that there are more effective ways to achieve the goal of repealing the Affordable Care Act, without specifying any alternatives.\n\nThe debate surrounding the Affordable Care Act has taken an unusual turn, with Democrats showing no signs of relenting on their support for the law, and the Republican Party lacking the political leverage to force them to repeal it. A government shutdown will not defund Obamacare, nor is it likely to change anyone's opinion about it.\n\nYet, many Republicans remain undeterred, and for good reason. The current discussion of resorting to a government shutdown to defund Obamacare highlights a shift in the character of Capitol Hill. The legislative process has traditionally been about numbers, with the most significant numbers being vote counts. The ability to pass a bill was determined by whether it had the necessary votes, and party leaders were skilled in gauging support and navigating bills to passage.\n\nHowever, a new breed of legislator is emerging, prioritizing ideology over vote counts. Senator Cruz hinted at this new political calculus in his speech about repealing Obamacare to Young Americans for Liberty in Arlington, VA, on Wednesday. \"Right now, we don't have the votes... I'm going to be perfectly candid, we can't win this fight,\" he told the 300 libertarian students. \"The only people who can win this fight are you. The only way we win this fight is if the American people rise up in overwhelming numbers and demand our elected officials to do the right thing and stand for principle.\"\n\nDespite Cruz's plea, demographics suggest that Young Americans for Liberty and like-minded voters may not have the numbers to change Congress enough to make a repeal feasible. However, they can play a decisive role in determining their next Republican candidate for Congress during the 2014 primaries. This is the math that fuels Cruz, or at least ensures that his shutdown-the-government views must be taken seriously by the Republican establishment.\n\nThe political polarization of America, particularly among Republicans, has replaced the old vote-counting strategists with ideologues who are less interested in vote counts than standing fearlessly for their constituents' demands, even if that is at odds with legislative realities. Cruz and his allies are simply seeking any legislative means at their disposal to do what the voters who elected them desperately want them to do: end Obamacare. The fact that there are no viable legislative means at their disposal is less important than the attempt, because in their states, the Republican primaries virtually decide the winner, and failure in a noble cause is seen as better than accession to a hated one.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan finds himself in a precarious position, as he balances his ideological leanings with the need to navigate the complexities of Capitol Hill. His views on strict financial austerity elicit cheers from the ideologues, yet he is also part of the old guard, using his position as House Budget Committee chairman as a bully pulpit from which to move the Congress rightward and toward greater acceptance of his ideas on entitlement reform. He is an ideologue with real power, and therefore must tread carefully or risk losing either his clout or his aura.\n\nThe current political climate in Washington, D.C., is uncertain, with no clear direction as to how this will unfold. The House's 40 failed attempts to kill Obamacare underscore the stakes as Republicans see it. If, instead of entitlement reform, we simply get another entitlement, the die will be cast, and America will be put on the path to becoming another Greece, living far beyond its means thanks to programs imposed upon the people by a massive and expanding government. Liberty will be dead, and the economy won't be far behind.",
    " Title: Secretary of State John Kerry Discusses U.S.-Russia Relations and Syria Conflict at Indiana University\n\nArticle:\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry addressed a packed auditorium at Indiana University on Thursday, where he was speaking at the opening of a school of international studies. In a light-hearted moment, Kerry joked about his 2004 presidential campaign, stating, \"I have managed to completely forget that when running for president in 2004, I was crushed in Indiana.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Kerry discussed the Obama administration's recent international agreements, including deals on Pacific trade and Iran's nuclear program. However, he also addressed darker issues, such as Russia's intervention in Syria's civil war. Russian warplanes have been conducting strikes against what the Ministry of Defense claims are \"terrorist targets\" for the third week.\n\nThe U.S. has been struggling to find forces that can oppose Syrian President Bashar Assad as well as the Islamic State. After his speech, Kerry sat down with NPR's Steve Inskeep, discussing the challenging task of convincing Russian President Vladimir Putin to target only Islamic extremists, not the Syrian rebels who oppose Assad.\n\n\"If they're supporting Assad, they're going to attract great difficulties for themselves and for any hope of a unified, secular Syria,\" Kerry said. \"Putin does not have a simple, easy track here,\" he added. \"This is not a situation where he's just moved in and taken over and everybody says, 'Oh, wow, he's doing something we couldn't.' No, he's not. He is not going to be able to stop the war by being there.\"\n\nRegarding the U.S.'s role in helping U.S.-backed Syrians who are now being attacked by Russian aircraft, Kerry stated, \"We are now having that discussion with the Russians right now. I talked to my counterpart today, to [Foreign Minister] Sergey Lavrov. We raised the issue of this 'deconfliction' process. We're very near coming to an agreement on exactly how that will work, and my hope is that it will lead to a broader set of understandings about where the targeting ought to be and what is truly helpful and what is not.\"\n\nWhen asked about the goals of the \"deconfliction\" talks with Lavrov, and whether they will go beyond the goal of keeping U.S. and Russian warplanes out of conflict with each other, Kerry responded, \"That's the immediate, that's the short-term, de minimus deconfliction, but it is possible that if you have adequate cooperation on the early steps of this horrible word 'deconfliction,' then it may be possible to actually engage in a broader conversation about how ISIL is going to be defeated, and who will bear what responsibility.\"\n\nKerry concluded by stating, \"Syria will crumble under the weight of a prolonged war. Putin does not have a simple, easy track here. This is not a situation where he's just moved in and taken over and everybody says, 'Oh, wow, he's doing something we couldn't.' No, he's not. He is not going to be able to stop the war by being there. It could be ISIL that actually winds up gaining in that process, and that would be absurd, it would be a farce, and I think President Putin understands that.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen what Russia's full strategy is in Syria. Kerry emphasized that if Russia is there to go after ISIL, and to in fact help prevent the takeover of the country and to secure a political track that could result in the end of the war, that could be positive. However, if Russia is there to uphold Assad, and to fake it with respect to the extremists and terrorists, that would be a serious problem. Kerry also addressed the issue of violence in the region, stating, \"There's no excuse for the violence. No amount of frustration is appropriate to license any violence anywhere at any time. No violence should occur.\"",
    " Title: Trump Narrows Supreme Court Nominee List to Five, Including Amy Coney Barrett, Joan Larsen, Brett Kavanaugh, Mike Lee, and Amul Thapar\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has been closely watched by legal circles and political observers alike, President Trump has announced that he will reveal his pick for the Supreme Court on July 9th, with two women among the five finalists. The age of the potential nominees averages at 48, and their conservative backgrounds are undisputed.\n\nThe five finalists, as deduced with the help of legal analysts, sitting jurists, and confidential sources, are:\n\n1. Amy Coney Barrett, 46, of the U.S. Court of Appeals (7th Circuit). A former editor of the Notre Dame Law Review and law professor at Notre Dame, Barrett was also a clerk for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Her appointment to the Court of Appeals in 2017 was met with controversy when Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., questioned whether her Catholic faith would influence her rulings. Barrett responded, \"It's never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law.\"\n\n2. Joan Larsen, 49, of the U.S. Court of Appeals (6th Circuit). A graduate of the Northwestern University School of Law, Larsen has had a rapid legal career, serving as Deputy assistant attorney general under George W. Bush, justice of the Michigan Supreme Court from 2015 to 2017, and U.S. appellate judge for the past two years. A member of the Federalist Society, Larsen is also a former law clerk for the late Justice Scalia.\n\n3. Brett Kavanaugh, 52, of the D.C. Court of Appeals. Kavanaugh, a favorite of Washington, D.C. legal conservatives, has a long history in the legal field, having served as a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. His judicial record is considered more conservative than his mentor, and he was a key figure in the impeachment of Bill Clinton by the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998. He was later appointed to the federal Appeals Court by President George W. Bush. In the Trump administration, Kavanaugh's biggest supporter is White House counsel Don McGahn.\n\n4. Mike Lee, 47, Republican U.S. senator from Utah. Trump has mentioned Lee as a potential high court appointee, calling him an \"outstanding talent.\" Raised in the law, Lee clerked for Samuel Alito when the justice was an appellate judge. He also served as general counsel to former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman (now U.S. ambassador to Russia). Considered one of the most conservative of Senate Republicans, Lee would be the first sitting senator to be appointed to the high court since Harold Burton (Republican senator from Ohio) was named by Harry Truman in 1945, and the first Mormon to sit on the Supreme Court.\n\n5. Amul Thapar, 49, of the U.S. Court of Appeals (6th Circuit). Thapar, who would be the first Indian-American to sit on the high court, has moved from being U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky, U.S. District judge from 2008 to 2015, and since last year, an appellate judge. As a minority, court-watchers say, he might be an attractive prospect for some Democrats in the Senate to support. McConnell and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have reportedly weighed in with the White House on his behalf.\n\nJohn Gizzi, chief political columnist and White House correspondent for \u2588\u2588\u2588, has reported extensively on the Supreme Court nomination process.

    " Title: Biden Reverses Course, Indicates Compliance with Subpoena for Impeachment Trial Testimony\n\nIn a swift turn of events, former Vice President Joe Biden has indicated that he would comply with a congressional subpoena to testify in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. This marks one of the most significant and rapid reversals by a candidate in the Democratic primary, according to the New York Times.\n\nBiden's change of position came after a day of intense scrutiny over the issue, following his statement to the Des Moines Register's editorial board on Friday that he would defy a Senate subpoena. This statement was a confirmation of a position he had earlier expressed during an interview with NPR.\n\nOn Saturday, Biden seemed to double down on his position with a series of tweets, stating that he has always \"cooperated with legitimate congressional oversight requests.\" However, he also emphasized that he would not pretend there was any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for his testimony in the impeachment trial.\n\nDuring a town hall in Fairfield, Iowa, Biden clarified his stance, stating, \"I would obey any subpoena that was sent to me.\" He further explained, \"There would be no basis upon which to call me as a witness.\"\n\nWhen asked about potential legal challenges to a subpoena, Biden said it was too early to say. \"The answer is, I don't think that's going to happen to begin with. Let's cross that bridge when it comes,\" he said, adding, \"I would in fact abide by whatever was legally required of me. I always have.\"\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren also weighed in on the issue, stating that if Congress issues a lawfully issued subpoena to Biden, he should appear. Warren emphasized that the focus should remain on Trump and his actions.\n\nThis development in Biden's stance on the subpoena issue has added another layer of complexity to the ongoing impeachment trial and the Democratic primary race.",
    " Title: Anonymous Donors Fuel Political Advertising Through \"Social Welfare\" Organizations in 2012 Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the 2012 presidential campaign, some of the heaviest advertisers are groups financed by anonymous donors, classified as \"social welfare\" organizations under federal tax law. Peter Overby, NPR's money and politics correspondent, reports that these organizations are spending significant amounts on high-profile ads, rivaling the campaigns themselves.\n\nFour months before the election, the top three advertisers are President Obama's re-election campaign ($40 million), Mitt Romney's campaign ($32 million), and Crossroads GPS, a \"social welfare\" organization, with $29 million in ad spending, according to Overby's report on NPR's Weekend Edition Saturday.\n\nSocial welfare organizations, classified under Section 501 (c) (4) of the tax code, are intended to perform some kind of public or community benefit. They include groups like local volunteer fire departments, Rotary International, and the League of Women Voters. However, these organizations are not required to disclose their donors, creating a gray area where election law meets tax law.\n\nCrossroads GPS, which is led by Republican strategist Karl Rove, ran an ad in Virginia criticizing President Obama and Democratic Senate candidate Tim Kaine. Rove recently explained to Fox News why the group can call itself a \"social welfare\" organization: \"It's a social welfare organization because it spends the vast preponderance of its money in furtherance of its social welfare goals. It's an issues advocacy group.\"\n\nCrossroads GPS, formed in 2010 following the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling that loosened some campaign finance regulations, has raised $77 million in its first two years. Overby reports that 90 percent of that came from at most 24 donors, making the \"social welfare\" organization approach appealing due to its anonymity.\n\n\"This is what makes the social welfare organization approach so appealing,\" Overby explains. \"You've got a couple dozen people who are able to play this incredibly powerful role in the election. It's anonymous. Nobody will ever know who they are. Not their business competitors. Not their political rivals. And not the voters.\"",
    " Title: Obama Reinforces NATO Allies, Urges Russia to De-escalate in Ukraine Crisis\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a visit to Poland, President Barack Obama has intensified the U.S.'s standoff with Russia over Ukraine, announcing a $1 billion plan to bolster security for NATO allies and warning Moscow against further aggression. The plan, known as the \"European Re-Assurance Initiative,\" includes increased military presence, exercises, and training missions throughout Europe, as well as potential assistance for non-NATO nations such as Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova.\n\nDuring his meetings with Polish and Eastern European leaders, Obama emphasized the importance of European security, stating, \"European security is a cornerstone of our own security and it is sacrosanct.\" The U.S. President also reiterated the U.S.'s policy of not providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, but expressed readiness to provide training, advice, and non-lethal assistance to modernize Ukraine's military.\n\nThe U.S. President's visit to Poland, a crossroads of the old Cold War, comes as he prepares to meet with Ukraine's president-elect, Petro Poroshenko, for the first time. Poroshenko, who will be sworn in on Saturday, has stated that he will ask for U.S. assistance, including military equipment.\n\nObama's trip will also take him to the G-7 summit in Brussels, where Russian activity in Ukraine will be a major topic. The president's visit will conclude in Normandy, France, with a commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, featuring a number of world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nObama and Putin do not have a formal meeting scheduled, but the U.S. President said he is sure he will encounter his Russian counterpart. He called on Putin to encourage separatists in eastern Ukraine to \"stand down,\" and urged Russia to \"responsible behavior\" to help rebuild American-Russian relations, which have been \"shattered by Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.\"\n\nObama's visit to Poland serves as a reminder of the nation's role in breaking up the Soviet Union after the birth of the Solidarity labor movement led by Lech Walesa. Since Poland gained independence in 1989, it has been a popular stop for U.S. presidents in the post-Cold War era. However, the visit has also attracted criticism from local critics, including former Polish President Lech Walesa, who has criticized Obama for not being robust enough in the Ukraine crisis.",
    " Title: Trump Proposes Revisions to Diversity Visa Program Following New York City Attack\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the aftermath of Tuesday's deadly attack in New York City, the alleged perpetrator, Sayfullo Saipov, is said to have entered the United States seven years ago through the Diversity Visa Program. This program, which has come under scrutiny following the attack, could potentially be a subject of revision as President Trump proposes changes to his \"extreme vetting\" program.\n\nThe Diversity Visa Program, a State Department program that offers a lottery for individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S., has drawn criticism from Trump. In a tweet early Wednesday, Trump stated, \"The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit-based, not more Democrat Lottery Systems. We are fighting hard for Merit-Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).\"\n\nThe DV program makes up to 50,000 immigrant visas available annually, with visas drawn from random selection among all entries from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S. Applicants must prove they have a clean criminal record, have a high school diploma or its equivalent, or have at least two years of work experience within the past five years to qualify.\n\nThe program was introduced in 1990 by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as part of a bill. Schumer's measure to make a set number of visas available to \"diversity immigrants\" from certain countries was absorbed into a larger House immigration bill, which passed in a bipartisan but contested vote. The program has been in the crosshairs of Congress several times, most recently with the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act, which called for its elimination.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., sponsored the RAISE Act, and the Trump White House came out in support of the bill, calling the DV program \"outdated\" and stating that it \"serves questionable economic and humanitarian interests.\"\n\nIn response to Trump's comments, Sen. Schumer called on the president to rescind proposed cuts to \"vital anti-terrorism funding\" in his budget. \"I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution - anti-terrorism funding - which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, following the attack, Schumer kept his post-attack comments to praise of the NYPD. \"Thanks NYPD for rapidly responding to tragic situation downtown. Worried & saddened to hear about injuries & loss of life,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nThe details of Saipov's travel to America and the implications for the Diversity Visa Program will likely become a topic of further discussion as President Trump proposes revisions to his immigration policies.",
    " Title: A Comparative Analysis of Data Privacy Concerns: Facebook vs. IRS\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate about data privacy, particularly regarding Facebook's collection of personal information, it's worth noting that another entity, arguably less trustworthy, is currently holding a vast amount of sensitive data: the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Unlike Facebook, however, users have no choice but to share this information with the IRS.\n\nWhile Facebook's data-mining practices, which allowed third-party apps to compile detailed user profiles until 2015, have raised privacy concerns, the information was based on voluntarily surrendered data. Users who are uncomfortable with Facebook's policies can choose to close their accounts or strategically fill their profiles with false information.\n\nIn contrast, individuals cannot evade the IRS's demands for financial, business, property, and family information. The tax agency imposes penalties for failing to file a tax return or for late tax payments. This was evident in the case of Boris Johnson, who, as the former mayor of London, was forced to pay a substantial tax bill to the U.S. IRS due to his American birth, despite leaving the country by the age of 5.\n\nThe purposes to which the IRS puts the extracted data are more alarming, encompassing the funding of an ever-expanding government that exerts control and drains resources. Compared to targeted political messages, these uses are far more chilling.\n\nThe IRS's history of handling sensitive data is questionable, with instances of data leaks, careless storage, and unethical employee behavior. For example, Ryan Payne, a former IRS agent, pleaded guilty earlier this year to using other people's Social Security numbers, information obtained during business audits, while applying for a loan and a bank account.\n\nMoreover, Della Ornelas and Randall Ruff, former IRS employees, were involved in a long-term relationship that combined tax collection with fraud. Their shared interests led them to lengthy careers at the IRS, marriage, and eventually prison.\n\nSenators could have grilled IRS representatives about the agency's handling of sensitive information, including the issuance of awards to over 1,900 employees with disciplinary or adverse actions, some of whom had serious misconduct records. The IRS has also been the target of hacking attacks, with over 700,000 Social Security numbers and other sensitive records stolen in the past couple of years.\n\nThe consequences of these breaches can be severe. In 2013, the IRS paid out $5.8 billion in fraudulent refunds due to identity theft, and a breach of the IRS Data Retrieval Tool last year allowed hackers to steal upwards of $30 million from nearly 100,000 college students.\n\nGiven the IRS's history of data breaches and questionable data handling, it's understandable that users might be more concerned about their social media data. However, the logical response when filing tax returns with the IRS should be not annoyance, but a healthy dose of fear.",
    " Title: Iowa Voters Turn Out in Droves for Early In-Person Voting\n\nArticle:\n\nAs early in-person voting begins in Iowa, the first swing state to open polling sites, a surge of voters can be seen at county auditors' offices across the state. Residents can now cast their ballots in person at their local county auditors' offices, by mail, or at additional satellite locations in some areas.\n\nIn downtown Des Moines, a line of voters stretched down the block as the Polk County Auditor's office opened its doors on Thursday morning. Among the early voters was Peter Clay, a 62-year-old supporter of President Obama who has been volunteering for the campaign on his days off from his job as a zookeeper.\n\n\"It's important to have a lot of folks showing up today because it shows there's passion and energy in this campaign,\" Clay said. \"This is our first chance to show how much we care about the outcome and to demonstrate we want this president in office for another four years.\"\n\nDemocrats seemed to dominate the early voting scene in Johnson County, where the polls opened in Iowa City. Victoria Walton, a librarian in Iowa City and an Obama supporter, said she didn't see any reason to wait until Election Day.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about the election, and I wanted to place my vote as soon as possible,\" she said. \"I've already decided, and the debates are not going to change my mind in any way. I've been listening carefully and thinking about this a long time.\"\n\nAleta Alexander, a 63-year-old voter from Waterloo in eastern Iowa, was among several voters who said they were volunteering for the Obama campaign.\n\n\"I voted for him in 2008 because I thought for sure he was the president that was for all the people\u2014not just blacks for whites or whatever but for everybody,\" she said. \"And I still believe that. So that's why I'm voting for him again.\"\n\nWhile there were Romney supporters, they were harder to find. Virginia Sourbeer, a retired state legislative staffer and former teacher from Des Moines, described herself as socially moderate but said she was worried about the federal budget and spending in programs like Medicare and Social Security. Sourbeer said she trusts Romney more when it comes to the economy.\n\n\"I just think that his background, for one thing, and his record in Massachusetts, that he dealt with difficult economic times there, that he'll deal with the issue,\" she said. \"Because we've had somebody who will not deal with the issue the last four years.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee's Iowa spokesman, Tom Szold, said Republicans have intentionally held off on most efforts to promote absentee voting until this week. He said they believe Romney voters will show up on Election Day if not before.\n\n\"It's common knowledge that the Democrats are ahead of us in this,\" he said. \"They start much earlier and they focus largely on their base. And we think that's because they're basically worried that their base is not going to turn out on Election Day.\"\n\nBut Erin Seidler, President Obama's campaign spokeswoman in Iowa, said promoting early voting just makes sense.\n\n\"We have 40 days to vote in Iowa. Why you would let any one of those days go by without getting folks to the polls is surprising to me,\" Seidler said.\n\nThe Obama campaign has pushed early voting across the country, urging Iowans in particular to \"Be the First\" to vote for the president. Democrats have requested the overwhelming majority of absentee ballots in Iowa, but Republicans have an 18,000-person lead in voter registration.\n\nPolk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald said Democrats have a longer track record of working to get out the early vote.\n\n\"Recently Republicans have started doing it,\" he said. \"So the numbers are going to come a little bit closer. But the Democrats have been known for a lot of shoe leather, and working early.\"\n\nIowa is among more than 30 states that allow early voting. The early voting trend is expected to continue as the election approaches, with many voters eager to make their voices heard and ensure their votes are counted.",
    " Title: Hillary Clinton Concedes Presidential Election, Vows to Respect Result and Encourage Open Minds\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a poignant and emotional concession speech on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton acknowledged her crushing defeat at the hands of Republican Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, expressing her own disappointment and empathizing with the millions of Americans who had invested their hopes and dreams in her campaign.\n\nThe former Secretary of State, who was once poised to become the nation's first female president, instead found herself a two-time presidential loser, embroiled in a federal investigation and grappling with the reality of a political career that may have ended with a dramatic thud rather than the historic victory she had anticipated.\n\nClinton's defeat, which shook the nation's political class and erased liberals' hope for a Democratic dynasty in the White House, highlighted deep discontent among voters and exposed the flaws in Clinton's candidacy. The election result underscored the nation's political divide and the American public's desire for change.\n\nIn her concession speech, delivered at the New Yorker hotel with her husband and daughter by her side, Clinton acknowledged the deep division in the country and expressed her belief in America. She urged Americans to respect the result and to give Trump a chance to lead, emphasizing the importance of the peaceful transfer of power in the American democratic system.\n\nClinton's future is uncertain, as she faces ongoing scrutiny over her mishandling of classified information and questions about corruption within the Clinton Foundation. The State Department is still under court order to continue releasing emails from her private server from her tenure as secretary of state, and watchdog groups plan to continue pushing for more disclosures, even though Clinton will no longer be the 45th president of the United States.\n\nThe FBI investigation into pay-for-play accusations involving Clinton's State Department and Clinton Foundation ensures that critics' corruption accusations won't disappear now that the presidential race is over.\n\nPolitical analysts attribute Clinton's election loss to a combination of factors, including her status as a political elitist, her handling of the email scandal, and the groundswell of Republican enthusiasm at the gubernatorial and state legislature level across the country. Lara Brown, an associate professor of political management at George Washington University, noted that the election result was not just about Clinton, but also about the change election that had been brewing for years.\n\nCompounding the tone-deaf nature of her candidacy, Clinton was dogged by deep questions about her honesty and trustworthiness, largely because of her private email server and admitted carelessness with classified information. The FBI cleared Clinton of criminal wrongdoing twice, but critics argue that the FBI announcement merely cemented the notion that she was a political elitist held to a different standard than other Americans.\n\nOutside of the political and legal questions, Clinton's electoral defeat was a personal blow. Her attempts to break the glass ceiling of American politics have been twice thwarted, first by Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary and Tuesday by Trump. Clinton addressed that painful failure in her concession speech and told young women across the country not to be discouraged.\n\n\"To all the women, and especially the young women who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,\" she said. \"I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday someone will, and hopefully sooner than we may think right now.\"",
    " Title: Trump Signs Executive Order Promoting and Protecting Religious Liberty: Mixed Reactions from Faith Leaders\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON -- In a move to uphold religious freedom, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday during the National Day of Prayer, marking a first-of-its-kind event at the White House. The order aims to promote and protect religious liberty, a campaign promise made by the president.\n\nEvangelicals, Catholics, Jews, and others gathered in the Rose Garden for the occasion. The president emphasized the importance of religious freedom, stating, \"We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced anymore.\"\n\nThe executive order includes two main components. First, it reaffirms the government's commitment to uphold and enforce existing religious liberty laws. Second, it addresses the Johnson Amendment, which forbids churches and other non-profits from supporting and endorsing political candidates. The order also protects the conscience of employers who do not wish to provide contraception and abortion-inducing drugs in their insurance plans, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNotable among the audience were several nuns from the Little Sisters of the Poor, who sued the Obama administration over the HHS mandate. The president invited them on stage to acknowledge their efforts.\n\nWhile many evangelical leaders have praised the president's actions as an important first step, they have also expressed disappointment with the order's lack of detail and the absence of comprehensive religious liberty protections. Ryan T. Anderson, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, noted that the order's language addressing the Johnson Amendment does not address the most pressing religious liberty issues facing Americans.\n\nSen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), co-chair of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, and the Alliance Defending Freedom have also expressed their disappointment, urging the administration to take further action to ensure religious freedom.\n\nHowever, other faith leaders, such as Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, and Franklin Graham, have praised the order for its potential to combat the hostility Christians have faced under previous administrations.\n\nThe order has sparked concerns among some on the left, with fears that it could lead to discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, same-sex couples, and women. The ACLU initially threatened to sue the administration but later announced it had decided against legal action.\n\nThe executive order serves as a significant step in the ongoing debate over religious liberty, with both supporters and critics offering their perspectives on its implications. The order's impact and future actions remain to be seen as the administration continues to navigate the complex and sensitive issue of religious freedom.",
    " Title: NRA Faces $100 Million in Legal Costs, According to Secret Recording of Board Meeting\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) has reportedly incurred $100 million in legal costs due to ongoing investigations and internal turmoil, according to a secret recording of a board meeting obtained by NPR.\n\nIn the recording from the NRA's winter meeting in January 2020, CEO Wayne LaPierre criticized ongoing investigations by the New York and Washington, D.C. attorneys general, referring to the investigations as \"the power of weaponized government.\" LaPierre also revealed that the organization had made $80 million in cuts to its budget to stay afloat.\n\nThe NRA's internal strife came to light at the April 2019 annual members' meeting, when then-President Oliver North stepped down in protest following media reports of self-dealing and poor management of NRA funds. These reports included mentions of LaPierre's lavish six-figure spending on clothing and travel. An attempt to oust LaPierre failed at that same meeting.\n\nSince then, the New York and D.C. attorneys general have launched investigations into the NRA's finances. Eight board members have resigned over the past year, and the NRA has been embroiled in costly legal battles with its longtime public relations firm.\n\nIn the recording, LaPierre, who is the CEO and executive vice president of the gun rights group, said the scandals that have plagued the organization since 2018 have cost the group dearly. \"The cost that we bore was probably about a hundred-million-dollar hit in lost revenue and real cost to this association in 2018 and 2019,\" LaPierre said, according to the tape.\n\nTo weather the storm, LaPierre said that he had dramatically reduced the size of the organization's budget. \"What we did in order to survive and adjust is we took in 2019 and 2020... about $80 million in real costs out of the NRA budget,\" LaPierre said. \"I mean, we kinda reframed this entire association. We took it down to the studs.\"\n\nAlthough the NRA has maintained its membership level, LaPierre said that there was still much to be done. \"We're not out of the woods yet. We still got ta wrestle with this financial situation,\" he said.\n\nLaPierre also lashed out at the attorneys general of New York and D.C., comparing their investigations to oppression from autocratic regimes. \"I've never seen anything like that in the United States of America, to tell you the truth. I mean, that is Cuba, that is communist China, that is Venezuela, it's Russia,\" LaPierre said.\n\nThe offices of the D.C. and New York attorneys general declined to comment.\n\nThe recording was made on January 11, 2021, during an NRA board meeting in Virginia. While board members made up most of the attendees, there were also NRA staff and a few dozen NRA members present. One of those present was Ron Carter, the vice president of Save the Second, an organization of NRA members urging financial reform and accountability within the National Rifle Association.\n\n\"The repeated statement from LaPierre about the $100 million cost to the NRA should have come with an apology for having manifested the situation,\" Carter told NPR. \"The lack of accountability is troubling for many members.\"\n\nSave the Second is not associated with the recording obtained by NPR. The National Rifle Association did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe NRA announced layoffs and pay cuts in late March, blaming the coronavirus crisis for these measures. The coronavirus crisis also prompted the cancellation of the group's annual convention, which had been scheduled to take place this past weekend.\n\nWhile the coronavirus crisis has undoubtedly affected the organization's finances, the tape of LaPierre from January indicates that many of the organization's financial cuts were underway well before the emergence of the public health crisis. Legal costs remain a heavy burden on the organization: In the ongoing litigation between the NRA and Ackerman McQueen, its former public relations firm, a brief filed by the firm on April 15 indicates its belief that the NRA has paid its outside legal counsel \"over $54 million\" in the last two years.",
    " Title: Republican Push to Split and Shrink 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Gains Momentum on Capitol Hill\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding President Trump's immigration executive order, a Republican-led initiative to divide the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and form a new 12th Circuit is gaining traction on Capitol Hill.\n\nSenators Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona have proposed legislation that aims to carve six states out of the San Francisco-based court circuit, creating a new circuit encompassing Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Arizona, and Alaska. The remaining states under the 9th Circuit would be California, Oregon, Hawaii, and two island districts.\n\nFlake and McCain argue that the 9th Circuit is too large, too liberal, and too slow in resolving cases. Flake stated, \"It represents 20 percent of the population, and 40 percent of the land mass is in that jurisdiction. It's just too big.\" He further noted that the court typically takes 15 months to deliver a decision.\n\nThe 9th Circuit has long been a target of conservative criticism, often referred to as the \"Nutty 9th\" or the \"9th Circus.\" This reputation stems from the high number of its rulings that have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court is known for its liberal leanings, with 18 of its 25 active judges appointed by Democratic presidents.\n\nUnder Flake's bill, the new circuit would replace the current one, while the House version, introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs and four other Arizona Republicans, would leave Washington state in the 9th Circuit.\n\nEfforts to split the circuit date back to 1941, but the 1998 appointment of a commission to reassess the federal appeals courts' structure ultimately recommended against dividing the 9th Circuit. However, the large size of the circuit, which covers a significant portion of the western United States, is not without precedent. In 1929, Congress split the 8th Circuit to accommodate population growth and increased caseloads.\n\nDemocratic strategist Joe Lestingi countered accusations of the court's liberal bias, stating, \"We don't complain about courts being too conservative. The truth is... the liberal side of that court provides the conflict we need to settle our most basic disagreements.\" He argued that the court's rulings being overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court is a part of the judicial process.\n\nThe future of the 9th Circuit remains uncertain, as the Republican push to divide and shrink the court continues to gain momentum on Capitol Hill.",
    " Title: Rep. Rashida Tlaib Meets with Controversial Pro-Palestinian Organization\n\nArticle:\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has been under scrutiny following her recent meeting with the Palestine Youth Movement (PYM), a pro-Palestinian organization that has been associated with controversial and violent rhetoric against Israel. The meeting took place during the Arab Texas Festival in Dallas.\n\nThe PYM has a history of anti-Israel activity, including a 2018 event in San Francisco where attendees called for the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers. This was reported by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA).\n\nOn social media, the PYM has memorialized individuals involved in terrorist attacks against Israel, with at least three of those honored being known operatives of the Hamas terror group. The organization has also been linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a group that has committed terror attacks on Israel.\n\nIn addition, the PYM has been involved in campus events, including one at the University of California, Los Angeles, where attendees chanted \"long live the intifada,\" a phrase often used by those advocating armed resistance against Israel.\n\nIn July 2019, a PYM event in Toronto, Canada, was canceled after it was revealed that the group had hosted an event with a PFLP member. In response, PYM blamed \"Zionist organizations\" for the cancellation.\n\nTlaib's meeting with the PYM is the latest in a series of interactions she has had with anti-Israel groups and supporters of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Tlaib and her freshman colleague Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) have also faced criticism for their attempts to organize a trip to Israel sponsored by Miftah, an organization that has praised supporters of terrorism and promoted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\n\nThe meeting between Tlaib and the PYM is unlikely to be viewed favorably by the pro-Israel community, and raises questions about Tlaib's willingness to associate with radical and fringe anti-Israel groups as a member of Congress.",
    " Title: Rep. Mark Amodei Supports Impeachment Inquiry, Stresses Need for Fact-Finding in Trump-Ukraine Controversy\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent development, Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) has expressed his support for the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, while emphasizing his reservations about impeaching the President. The Nevada Independent reported that Amodei, during a conference call with reporters, stated, \"Let's put it through the process and see what happens. I'm a big fan of oversight, so let the committees get to work and see where it goes.\"\n\nFollowing the publication of the Nevada Independent's article, Amodei released a statement reiterating his stance on the impeachment inquiry, but not necessarily impeachment itself. He stated that his position mirrors that of Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV).\n\nSen. Cortez-Masto told KTVN-TV, \"I think from all of that information, we have to follow the facts and figure out what happened here.\"\n\nIn response to a Nevada Independent reporter's article, Amodei clarified his position, stating that the article's first paragraph, which reads, \"Rep. Mark Amodei supports the House's inquiry into whether President Donald Trump should be impeached, but is withholding judgment on whether Trump has crossed the legal line,\" is accurate in the sense that both the House and Senate have unanimously supported a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the whistleblower complaint received on August 12, 2019, should be transmitted to the relevant committees. However, Amodei emphasized that he did not indicate support for impeachment and instead stressed his agreement with Sen. Cortez-Masto's statement.\n\nAmodei further clarified that anyone interpreting the article as suggesting a vote to convict before the process has played out is inaccurate. He stated, \"Anyone who reads Mr. Sanchez's article and thinks that somehow there is a vote to convict before the process has played out \u2013 as called for by the resolution unanimously supported by everyone concerned \u2013 is simply, individual fantasy.\"\n\nAmodei expressed his desire to understand the facts of the controversy surrounding President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He stated, \"I think that's why we have the committee process. I won't attribute what was in the president's mind. That wasn't a great way to express concern about it. Part of what the committees will do is try to find some context for that and then based on what a fair reading of the context is, they'll go forward from there.\"\n\nAmodei concluded by stating, \"I don't care if it was a partisan spy or not. The only thing I get a vote on is, if it comes to the House floor... do I think that there is evidence there that is credible, that says he broke a specific law?\" The congressman's comments underscore the importance of fact-finding and due process in the ongoing impeachment inquiry.",
    " Title: FISA Documents Reveal Steele Dossier as Key Component in Carter Page Surveillance Warrant\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant development, the Department of Justice has released documents detailing the government's justification for the FISA surveillance warrant against Carter Page, a former advisor to then-candidate Donald Trump. The materials, which include an October 2016 application for a wiretap and several renewal applications, are highly unusual for their release in the context of FISA wiretap applications.\n\nThe documents, though heavily redacted, show that the infamous Steele Dossier, an unverified opposition research document funded by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton's campaign, was a major component of the 2016 surveillance warrant. The dossier, which contains salacious allegations against Trump, was also a significant factor in subsequent renewals.\n\nVisible sections of the released FISA documents do not indicate that the dossier was ever verified. Instead, the FBI claimed that Steele was \"reliable\" based on his previous work. The FISA records also reveal that a September 2016 Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff was a significant part of the government's warrant application.\n\nHowever, London court records show that Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm behind the Steele Dossier. The newly released FISA warrant application, however, seems to indicate the Yahoo News article was an independent piece of corroborating information that justified the surveillance of Carter Page. Republicans question whether the story is an example of circular reporting that merely repeated information from Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that commissioned former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dossier.\n\nBased on what is visible, the dossier is not described to the FISA court as a political document, as the Democrats have asserted; in fact, the FBI speculates to the FISA court that it was commissioned to damage Candidate 1, who is Donald Trump. Page's denials of the Yahoo News reporting were included in the early renewals to the FISA application. The last renewal in late Spring 2017 is particularly important, as by that point, the FBI had dumped Steele as a source after he misled them over his media contacts.\n\nOne of the documents reads: \u201cThe FBI speculates to the FISA court that the U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit candidate 1\u2019s campaign.\u201d The document suggests that the U.S. person is Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS.\n\nThe unredacted FISA materials also contain only limited references to ex-Trump advisor George Papadopoulos. Media reports had speculated that Papadopoulos' 2016 meeting in London with a professor who had ties to Russia was a key justification for the FISA-authorized surveillance of Page. Papadopoulos has since pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe.\n\nCritics have charged that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who signed off on the FISA application renewals, should not have approved them without more reliable intelligence.\n\nReacting to the document release, Page told [redacted], \"I'm having trouble finding any small bit of this document that rises above complete ignorance and/or insanity.\" President Trump also weighed in on Twitter Sunday, calling the situation a \"scam.\"\n\n\"Looking more & more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC,\" Trump wrote. \"Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!\"\n\nThe surveillance of Page became a contentious matter between Republican and Democratic lawmakers earlier this year. Republicans alleged the FBI had abused its surveillance powers and improperly obtained the warrant, a charge that Democrats rebutted as both sides characterized the documents in different ways. The documents, meanwhile, remained out of public view.\n\nHouse Democrats were quick to say that the documents bolstered their arguments. \"For more than a year, House Republicans have bullied the Department of Justice and FBI to release highly sensitive documents to derail the Special Counsel's and other legitimate national security investigations and cover for the President,\" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. \"For the sake of our national security and our democracy, these vital investigations must be allowed to continue unhindered by Republican interference. The GOP must cease their attacks on our law enforcement and intelligence communities, and finally decide where their loyalty lies.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the documents underscore the \"legitimate concern\" the FBI had about Page's activities. Yet Schiff said the materials should not have been released during an ongoing investigation because of national security.\n\nSchiff blamed Trump for making public the House Republicans' initial memo about the FISA applications, a move by Trump that the congressman called \"nakedly political and self-interested, and designed to to interfere with the Special Counsel's investigation.\"\n\nEarlier this year, GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee voted to release a memo claiming the DOJ abused the FISA warrant process in order to hurt Trump's presidential campaign, claiming the warrant against Page was based in significant part on the Steele Dossier. Trump declassified the memo over the objections of the FBI, which warned that the document contained \u201cmaterial omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo\u2019s accuracy,\u201d the Hill report said.",
    " Title: \"Sen. Sherrod Brown and Rep. Jim Renacci Engage in Allegation Exchange Ahead of Ohio Senate Race\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown and his Republican challenger, Rep. Jim Renacci, are embroiled in a legal dispute following Renacci's sexual harassment allegation against Brown from three decades ago.\n\nRenacci's Senate campaign, through attorney Laura Mills, released a statement detailing the account of an unnamed woman who claims Brown made an \"unexpected, uninvited, unwanted, and sudden advance\" in the late 1980s. The statement alleges that Brown \"roughly pushed her up against a wall,\" but the incident stopped when she expressed discomfort and pulled away.\n\nThe statement does not provide specific details about the location or the events leading up to the alleged incident. The woman met Brown through the \"course of her work.\" The statement also mentions that she chose not to report the incident at the time because it stopped in that moment.\n\nAttorney Mills is a former business partner and political donor of Rep. Renacci, according to Cleveland.com. The statement was released a day after Renacci told the Cincinnati Enquirer that he had heard from \"multiple women\" with abuse allegations against Brown.\n\nIn response, Brown's campaign issued a cease and desist letter demanding Renacci stop \"making unsubstantiated and false claims about something that never happened,\" or face \"legal ramifications.\"\n\nCampaign spokesman Preston Maddock stated, \"Pure and simple this is character assassination by a failed and desperate candidate who every day reaches new lows. This will not be tolerated, all legal means will be pursued against Jim Renacci.\"\n\nRenacci has used Brown's contentious 1986 divorce and separate uncorroborated allegations of abuse as a means to portray Brown as hypocritical for voting \"no\" on confirming Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who faced his own allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nRenacci stated Thursday that the new allegation raises \"even more questions and alarm over Mr. Brown's conduct toward women.\"\n\nCurrent polls show Brown leading Renacci by 16 points in the Ohio Senate race, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls.",
    " Title: Trump Pardons Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, Convicted in Plame Affair, Amidst Ongoing Mueller Investigation\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has raised eyebrows and sparked debate, President Donald Trump has reportedly signed off on a pardon for Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. The pardon, which was announced on Thursday evening, comes as Trump's administration faces an ongoing investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nLibby was convicted in 2007 for lying under oath to a grand jury investigating the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity. The revelation of Plame's identity, which put her life at risk, was a calculated move by some in the Bush administration to retaliate against Plame's husband, Joe Wilson, who had exposed false claims used to justify the war in Iraq.\n\nDuring the Bush administration, there was significant support from the right for a pardon for Libby, with the term \"witch hunt\" commonly used to describe the prosecution for the alleged crime of releasing classified information and lying to a grand jury. However, in the last days of Bush's presidency, he commuted Libby's sentence but did not issue a full pardon, allowing the conviction to stand.\n\nNow, Trump is reaching back over a decade to pardon Libby. While Trump's administration has claimed that the pardon has been on Trump's mind for months, the timing of the pardon and the choice of Libby as the recipient have raised questions.\n\nThe pardon comes as several key figures in the Trump\u2013Russia investigation have pleaded guilty to making false statements and agreed to cooperate with Mueller. Alex Van der Zwaan, the first person sentenced in connection with the investigation, is currently serving time for making false statements. Before Van der Zwaan's sentencing, Mueller made it clear that knowingly making a false statement to an investigator was a crime that carried consequences.\n\nThe pardon of Libby, who was convicted of lying under oath, is seen by some as a signal that Trump views lying under oath as a trivial matter. With the power to pardon anyone, Trump's decision to pardon Libby has raised concerns about the administration's stance on the importance of truth and accountability in the face of investigations.",
    " Title: Trump Associates Face Mounting Legal Fees as Investigations Continue\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a development that underscores the financial burden associated with ongoing investigations, Trump confidant Roger Stone and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn have revealed significant legal expenses.\n\nOn Tuesday, Stone disclosed to TheDC that he anticipates incurring at least half a million dollars in legal fees due to lawsuits and congressional inquiries. To help offset these costs, Stone has established a legal defense fund, which can be accessed at WhoframedRogerStone.com.\n\nFlynn, too, has set up a website to help manage his legal fees as the financial implications of the Russia election interference probes grow for Trump associates.\n\nStone is currently embroiled in a lawsuit by Project Democracy, a group run by former Obama administration lawyers, over allegations of his involvement in the release of emails from Democratic Party officials. Stone stated that this lawsuit will surpass the costs associated with his upcoming hearing before the House Intelligence Committee on Sept. 26, and he also expects an invitation to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nBoth committees are conducting investigations into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. Stone told TheDC that the financial burden is a result of the lack of concrete evidence regarding Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).\n\n\"These folks can\u2019t even prove the Russians hacked the [Democratic National Committee (DNC)], because they didn\u2019t...nobody can prove it,\" Stone said.\n\nStone's claims of connecting with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who released emails from DNC officials, have been a point of contention. Stone stated that the repetition of allegations without proof has become a common tactic in Washington.\n\n\"There\u2019s a mindset in Washington if you just repeat a lie over and over, just keep repeating it, you don\u2019t have to come up with proof,\" Stone said. \"That c**ksucker [former CIA Director John Brennan] can say it as many times as he wants, it won\u2019t become true.\"\n\nBrennan has testified that he has concerns about potential Russian recruitment of Trump campaign aides.\n\nIn a separate report by Reuters, it was revealed that President Trump is using donations to his campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) to cover some of his legal fees, a legal procedure. An RNC spokesman told Reuters that the party covered a little over $230,000 in legal fees for the president.\n\nThe Daily Beast also reported on Monday that Flynn's legal fees are estimated to exceed $1 million. The mounting legal expenses for both Stone and Flynn highlight the financial strain that these investigations are imposing on Trump's associates.",
    " Title: Counterpoint to Trumka: Embracing a 'Grand Bargain' for Economic Stability and Retirement Security\n\nIn a recent op-ed, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka argued against a \"grand bargain\" budget agreement, expressing opposition to any potential fixes to Social Security and Medicare. However, a group of progressive organizations and economists are advocating for a balanced approach to maintaining the safety net and ensuring economic stability for future generations.\n\nFor nearly a century, progressives have worked tirelessly to establish a secure and comprehensive safety net. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the mission of creating a safety net is largely complete. As the nation approaches its most significant demographic aging, the focus now shifts to maintaining the safety net while ensuring its long-term solvency.\n\nA responsible approach to fixing the safety net requires a balance of measures that make the programs sustainable, including new revenue, modest reductions in benefits for some recipients, and a commitment to working-class people that payroll taxes will not be raised in the future. The proponents of this view also argue that the time to make these changes is now, for the following reasons:\n\n1. Acknowledging the collision course between public investments in people and jobs and the safety net: Over the past five decades, federal investments in infrastructure, education, research, and other growth-promoting initiatives have been outpaced by spending on major entitlement programs by a ratio of 3 to 1. By 2012, this ratio was reversed, with the nation spending $3 on entitlement programs for every dollar spent on public investments. By 2022, the ratio will be 6 to 1. This imbalance in spending priorities is unsustainable and must be addressed to create the economic growth and middle-class opportunities desired.\n\n2. Ensuring the long-term solvency of the safety net: By making necessary changes to Social Security and Medicare now, the programs can be made sustainable for future generations. This will require a combination of new revenue, modest reductions in benefits, and a commitment to working-class people that payroll taxes will not be raised in the future.\n\n3. Balancing the budget and promoting economic growth: A balanced budget that includes a mix of spending on public investments and the safety net is essential for long-term economic stability. By addressing the imbalance in spending priorities, the nation can create a more sustainable economic environment that supports both growth and the safety net.\n\nIn conclusion, while some progressive organizations have expressed opposition to a \"grand bargain\" budget agreement, a balanced approach that addresses the long-term solvency of the safety net and promotes economic growth is necessary for the well-being of future generations. By making necessary changes to Social Security and Medicare now, the nation can ensure the security and sustainability of its retirement entitlements while promoting economic growth and opportunity for all.",
    " Title: Trump Criticizes Bipartisan Immigration Proposal, Calls It \"Horrible\" on Border Security and \"Weak\" on Legal Immigration Reforms\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Wednesday expressed his disapproval of a proposed bipartisan immigration deal, labeling it as \"horrible\" on U.S. border security and \"very, very weak\" on reforms for the legal immigration system.\n\nIn an interview with a media outlet, Trump stated that the plan, which aims to address the demands for protections for young adults brought to the United States illegally as children, known as \"Dreamers,\" falls short of what most Republicans believe is necessary.\n\nThe Senate proposal, presented to Trump last week by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, was met with criticism by the President. Trump drew international condemnation after reports emerged that he had questioned the value of taking immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean nation of Haiti during a closed-door meeting at the White House last Thursday, referring to them as \"shithole\" countries. Trump has since denied using that term.\n\nIn the interview on Wednesday, Trump declined to specify the words he used during the meeting, stating, \"I'm not going to get into what I said, but I will tell you, it was a tough meeting.\"\n\nWith a federal government shutdown looming, many Democrats have said they will not vote for spending legislation to keep the federal government funded past a Friday deadline without an immigration deal. Republicans will need at least some Democratic votes to pass the funding extension in the Senate.\n\nTrump said a deal on immigration is still possible, stating, \"Time is running out.\" However, he also indicated a federal government shutdown \"could happen\" at the end of the week, insisting Democrats would be blamed if that occurs, even though Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House.\n\nThe White House has stated it backs a short-term spending measure by the Friday deadline to prevent a shutdown. Trump announced in September that he was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was begun by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, effective in March. The program currently protects roughly 700,000 people, mostly Hispanic young adults, from deportation and provides them work permits.\n\nTrump has said he is open to finding a solution to help the Dreamers. However, he became unhappy when Graham and Durbin, who had told him they had a compromise on the Dreamers issue, presented the details.\n\nIn a statement emailed to the media outlet, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said, \"The president can't seem to take yes for an answer and is heading toward a shutdown, which would fall squarely on his back.\"\n\nTrump called Republican Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, and Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte to join the meeting at the White House, describing them as \"smart guys, with more of a conservative bent, more of a bent like I have.\"\n\nAs Graham and Durbin began describing the deal, Trump said it was immediately clear it would be unacceptable to most Republicans. The proposal was \"horrible for the security of our country,\" Trump said, noting there was not enough funding for the wall he has promised to build on the U.S.-Mexican border, a project opposed by Democrats. The proposal was \"very, very weak\" on curbing visas for extended family members of immigrants, and failed to end a diversity visa lottery program.\n\nTrump blamed Durbin for leaking the language he used in the meeting, a disclosure that prompted critics to denounce Trump as a racist, an accusation he denied.",
    " Title: Koch Network Launches New Super PAC Ahead of Midterm Elections\n\nArticle:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The influential political network associated with free-market billionaire Charles Koch has unveiled a new super PAC, expanding its political influence in the lead-up to the crucial midterm elections in November. The Americans for Prosperity Action super PAC will enable the network to directly advocate for voters to support or oppose specific candidates.\n\nThe new super PAC is an extension of Koch's long-standing grassroots arm, Americans for Prosperity, which operates in 36 states. However, the nonprofit organization is subject to restrictions on its political activity.\n\nSuper PACs are permitted to raise and spend unlimited funds to influence elections, as long as they do not coordinate their spending decisions with the candidates they support.\n\nThe move follows a series of disagreements between Koch officials and President Donald Trump over trade and immigration policies. Koch's aides have criticized Trump's trade disputes with China and other countries, labeling them as protectionist measures that could negatively impact American businesses and consumers.\n\nTensions escalated when the Republican National Committee cautioned Republican donors, as well as GOP candidates who might utilize the Koch network's in-house data program to reach voters, to distance themselves from Koch and his political operation.\n\nIn a statement regarding the new super PAC, Koch officials expressed their commitment to collaborating with anyone to advance beneficial policies.\n\nThe exact spending amount through the new political committee has not been disclosed yet, but Koch's team previously indicated they were likely to allocate up to $400 million over the two-year election cycle to support candidates and promote free-market policies.\n\nRepublicans are currently fighting to maintain their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where Democrats need to win 23 seats to capture the chamber.\n\nAdditional reporting has revealed that the Koch network of donors has opted to support an independent candidate rather than a Republican in a critical Senate race in North Dakota.",
    " Title: U.S. Supreme Court's Asylum Policy Decision Sparks Controversy and Concerns Over Human Rights\n\nArticle:\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision to allow the Trump administration's asylum policy to take effect has sparked controversy and concerns over its legality and potential impact on asylum seekers. The policy, which requires asylum seekers to present themselves at official ports of entry, has been met with opposition from the left, who argue that it disregards international humanitarian law and the legal rights of asylum seekers.\n\n\"President Donald Trump has created an invisible wall to foreclose upon the possibility of migration from Central America,\" said one critic. \"Every day that Trump's asylum ban is imposed is another day of flouting the government's responsibility under international humanitarian law, and another day of ignoring the historical debt that Washington owes to Central America after decades of destabilizing and intervening in the region.\"\n\nThe policy, which has been challenged in court, is based on the argument that asylum seekers can only apply for asylum at official ports of entry. However, U.S. law states explicitly that people can arrive anywhere along the border and ask for asylum. Critics argue that the Trump administration may not have the legal authority to enact the new policy, and that it is a departure from the historical norm of the Supreme Court's involvement in such matters.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision is expected to deepen the crisis by pushing more asylum seekers into Mexico, which is ill-equipped to offer humanitarian aid. Asylum seekers in Mexico face dangers of kidnapping and sexual assault, overcrowded shelters, and slim employment prospects. They also have difficulty finding lawyers, without which their asylum cases are almost surely doomed to fail.\n\n\"Mexico has neither the infrastructure to absorb tens of thousands of asylum seekers nor a legally robust asylum process,\" said Jorge Luis Vasquez, an attorney at the immigrant advocacy group Latino Justice. \"Individuals fleeing persecution in Central America \u2014 for example, on account of sexual orientation \u2014 are not likely to find protection in Mexico.\"\n\nThe decision was both premature and unnecessary, according to critics, and is part of a troubling pattern of deference to Trump's wishes. The Supreme Court's aggressiveness has been spurred by an increase in so-called nationwide injunctions issued by district judges, although many emergency stays have been issued in cases where no nationwide injunction is at stake.\n\nThe controversy over the asylum policy is just one of many issues that has divided the nation during the Trump administration. As the 2020 presidential election approaches, the debate over immigration policy and the treatment of asylum seekers is likely to continue to be a hot-button issue.",
    " Title: \"The Cost and Practicality of Medicare for All: A Closer Look at Single-Payer Healthcare\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn the ongoing debate surrounding the future of American healthcare, the concept of \"Medicare for All\" has emerged as a significant talking point among progressive Democrats. Proponents argue that this system, which provides the same coverage as Medicare for all Americans, is a viable solution to the high cost of healthcare. However, a recent op-ed in The Wall Street Journal by Scott W. Atlas of the Hoover Institution presents a different perspective.\n\nAtlas highlights the cost issue as a major concern. For instance, implementing single-payer healthcare in California alone would cost approximately $400 billion annually, more than twice the state's current budget. Nationwide, \"Medicare for All\" is estimated to cost over $32 trillion over its first decade, a figure that exceeds the current national debt. Increasing federal income and corporate taxes would not be sufficient to cover these costs, and such a burden could potentially lead to further restrictions on health-care access.\n\nIn 2017, a single-payer bill passed by New York's state assembly would have cost $173 billion annually, significantly more than the state's current revenue generation. Even accounting for savings from eliminated insurance premiums and co-payments, the revenue required to sustain such plans remains elusive. In 2014, Vermont abandoned its single-payer healthcare proposal due to the significant financial burden it would impose, requiring an almost doubling of the state's current budget and substantial tax increases.\n\nAtlas also raises concerns about wait times and access to new drugs in single-payer systems. In the United Kingdom, for example, a record 4.2 million patients were on the National Health Service (NHS) waiting lists. In Canada, the median wait time between seeing a general practitioner and following up with a specialist was 10.2 weeks, while the wait between seeing a doctor and beginning treatment was about five months. A Fraser Institute study shows that the average Canadian waits three months to see an ophthalmologist, four months for an orthopedist, and five months for a neurosurgeon. In contrast, wait lists are not a significant issue in the United States.\n\nAdditionally, single-payer systems often experience delays in debuting new drugs for cancer and other serious diseases. A 2011 Health Affairs study showed that the Food and Drug Administration approved 32 new cancer drugs in the decade after 2000, while the European Medicines Agency approved 26. All 23 drugs approved by both Europe and the U.S. were available to American patients first. Two-thirds of the 45 \"novel\" drugs in 2015 were approved in the U.S. before any other country.\n\nAtlas acknowledges that many proponents of Medicare for All do not advocate for a fully nationalized healthcare system like Canada's. Instead, they seek a basic, accessible, and free (or near-free) system. Atlas offers a counterargument, suggesting that America's poor and middle class would suffer the most under a single-payer system, as they would be unable to circumvent the system. He also points to countries with single-payer systems, such as Sweden and Denmark, moving toward private provision of healthcare.\n\nAtlas argues that the United States should reconsider its approach to healthcare, focusing on allowing markets to function effectively in the healthcare sector, speeding up drug trials without compromising safety, and rethinking certification and licensing processes for healthcare professionals. Given the Republicans' reluctance to engage in healthcare policy following the passage of Obamacare, it seems unlikely that market-friendly solutions will be pursued in the near future. However, the potential financial and practical burdens of Medicare for All warrant careful consideration.",
    " Title: Major Brands Under Scrutiny for Advertising on Russian Social Media Platform Known for Hate Speech\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move to protest divisive political speech, over 100 companies have announced a boycott of Facebook. This boycott coincides with a public pressure campaign led by Joe Biden and other top Democrats to press Facebook to enforce stricter control over President Trump's postings. However, many of these companies, including Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Adidas, and Reebok, have been regular advertisers on VK, a popular Russian media website used by many white supremacists and neo-Nazis who have been banned from Facebook.\n\nThe boycott of Facebook, which began last week, has been met with criticism as several of these companies continue to have a marketing presence on VK. This raises questions about their recent concern about \"hate speech\" on social media sites.\n\nVK's popularity among white supremacists and neo-Nazis has been documented for years by media outlets and watchdog groups. Despite this, the companies that joined the Facebook ad boycott continue to market their products and brands on their VK pages, including Starbucks, Ford, Unilever, Colgate, Vans, The North Face, and Patagonia.\n\nOn July 2, two days after joining the Facebook ad boycott, Colgate ran a promotion on VK offering prizes to members who purchased its products and used the VK app to scan the product code. Coca-Cola has run advertising campaigns on VK, including a controversial 2016 ad in which the company included the disputed territories of Crimea and the Kuril Islands on a map of Russia. Pepsi has also been an advertiser on the site and reportedly collaborated with VK on a payment app in 2018.\n\nNone of the companies responded to inquiries about whether they would stop marketing on VK. Starbucks told the \u2588\u2588\u2588 that its temporary pause in advertising \"applies to all social media platforms.\" Microsoft, Honda, Reebok, Vans, Patagonia, Colgate, The North Face, Unilever, Pepsi, and Coca-Cola did not respond to request for comment.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League said VK has become \"an international hub for white supremacists\" who have been kicked off mainstream U.S. social media websites such as Facebook. \"Whereas posting most of their extremist comments, memes and videos on Facebook would likely result in suspensions or deplatforming, VK provides an open forum for such extremism,\" the ADL said last year.\n\nAlthough VK has taken some recent steps to crack down on hate groups\u2014including removing the page for a popular \"Miss Hitler Contest\" last year\u2014organizations like the National Socialist Movement and the Ku Klux Klan still maintain an active presence on the website. Last month, Focus magazine reported the far-right Russian Imperial Movement, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, has been holding paramilitary training sessions for foreign white supremacist groups this summer, which are bookable over VK.\n\nVK also complies with Russian laws against \"gay propaganda,\" which prohibit content that is considered supportive of same-sex relationships. Several gay-rights groups were barred from the website last October after a judge ruled that their posts violated the law.",
    " Title: Coronavirus Death Toll in U.S. Surpasses 9/11 Terror Attacks, Mirroring Far-Reaching Impact\n\nArticle:\n\nThe grim milestone of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States has been reached, as the death toll now surpasses the number of people killed in the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. As of March 30, the virus's death toll in the US has exceeded 3,100, surpassing the 2,977 victims who perished in the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and four hijacked planes on that fateful day.\n\nWhile the virus is distinct from the sudden, tragic events of September 11, its slow-moving toll on civilian lives promises to reshape American society in peacetime as only terror has done. It's important to note that the death toll surpassed 3,000 today, but the number of confirmed cases is still rising rapidly, indicating that many more people will likely succumb to COVID-19 in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nThe aftermath of September 11 extended far beyond its initial death toll. Thousands were injured in the attacks, and thousands more died of diseases caused by exposure to toxic substances in the aftermath of the Twin Towers' rubble. The economic impact was similarly grim: In the three months following the attack, New York City lost 143,000 jobs each month and $2.8 billion in wages, according to a New York Times report from 2004.\n\nThe coronavirus's effects will be similarly far-reaching. An estimated 160,000 people have been infected with the coronavirus in the United States, resulting in over 20,000 hospitalizations and placing an unprecedented strain on the nation's health care system. In addition, more than 3 million people have filed for unemployment due to the shuttering of non-essential businesses across the country. As the economy falters, the Congress passed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package\u2014the largest of its kind in modern history.\n\nThis article aims to provide a neutral, factual, and informative account of the current state of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, its impact, and the measures taken to mitigate its effects.

    " Title: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's Approval Ratings Soar in Post-Sandy Surveys\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a significant turn of events, three consecutive polls over the past 24 hours indicate a surge in New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's approval ratings, attributed primarily to his handling of the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy.\n\nAccording to a Quinnipiac University survey released Tuesday, 72% of Garden State voters approve of Christie's performance in office, marking a 16-point increase since before the storm hit the state in late October. This follows a Fairleigh Dickinson University survey from Monday, which indicated an approval rating of 77% for the first-term Republican governor, a 21-point increase since late October. A new Rutgers-Eagleton survey also shows Christie's favorable impression jumping 19 points to 67%.\n\nIn announcing his bid for a second term as New Jersey governor on Monday, Christie told local reporters that he aims to continue leading his state through the rebuilding and restoration process following the powerful storm, which caused significant damage in parts of New Jersey.\n\n\"The public needs to know that I'm in this for the long haul. The person who has helped to lead them through the initial crisis wants to be here to lead them through the rebuilding and restoration of our state,\" he said at the news conference. \"It would be wrong for me to leave now. I don't want to leave now. We have a job to do.\"\n\nChristie also announced the filing of documents to initiate his re-election bid, allowing him to set up his campaign, raise funds, and hire staff.\n\nThe Rutgers-Eagleton poll shows that 59% of New Jersey registered voters support a second term for Christie, while 32% oppose his re-election. In both the Quinnipiac and Fairleigh Dickinson polls, a significant factor in the increase in Christie's overall approval rating was a rise in support from Democrats.\n\nMaurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, commented, \"Gov. Chris Christie never looked more like a 'Jersey Guy' than when he stood on the Seaside boardwalk after Sandy, and, just about unanimously, his New Jersey neighbors \u2013 Republicans, Democrats, Independents \u2013 applauded.\"\n\nChristie was a top surrogate for Mitt Romney during the presidential campaign and was considered as a potential running mate for the GOP nominee. However, he faced criticism from some Republicans following Romney's loss for his appearance with President Barack Obama in New Jersey during the storm's aftermath and for his praise of the president and the federal government's assistance to New Jersey immediately after the storm.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll indicates that the vast majority of New Jersey voters, including two-thirds of Republicans, view the GOP criticism of Christie as \"nonsense.\"\n\nThe news on Monday that Christie will launch a re-election bid was widely expected. Much of the electoral speculation in New Jersey now focuses on which Democrat will challenge Christie next fall, with much of the speculation centered on two-term Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who is seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party. Newark's Democratic mayor said in mid-November his decision on running for governor has been pushed back because of Sandy.\n\nOther potential candidates include state Sen. Richard Codey, who served as governor for 14 months following the November 2004 resignation of then\u2013Gov. Jim McGreevey, as well as State Sen. Barbara Buono and Assembly member Lou Greenwald.\n\nAccording to the Rutgers-Eagleton poll, Christie has large leads over all of his possible Democratic challengers in hypothetical 2013 general election matchups.\n\nNew Jersey and Virginia are the only two states to hold gubernatorial contests in the year after a presidential election. Because they are the only games in town, they often receive outsized attention.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll was conducted November 19-25, with 1,664 New Jersey registered voters questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.4 percentage points. The Rutgers-Eagleton poll was conducted November 14-17, with 1,108 New Jersey registered voters questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.",
    " Title: House Declines to Take Up New Senate GOP Bill on National Emergencies Act; Showdown Vote on Trump's Border Wall Declaration Scheduled\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives will not consider a new Senate GOP bill aimed at curbing the National Emergencies Act. Pelosi stated that the goal is to constrain President Trump, not to address broader presidential powers issues.\n\nPelosi's comments were in response to a bill proposed by Sen. Mike Lee, which, in the future, would limit a president's powers under the 1976 Emergencies Act. The bill would not apply retroactively to President Trump's recent border emergency declaration or to the more than two dozen emergencies still in effect from previous presidents.\n\nDemocrats argue that the GOP is using the Lee bill as political cover to support Mr. Trump's wall declaration, while still appearing to prevent future presidential overreach. The Senate is set to hold a showdown vote on Thursday regarding the wall declaration.\n\nThe House has already passed a resolution to overturn the declaration, and it appears that enough Republicans are ready to join Democrats in the Senate to approve it in that chamber as well. However, President Trump has vowed to veto the bill, and there is currently not enough support to override him.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday that Republicans do not question Mr. Trump's powers, but they do have concerns about his decision to divert funds from the Pentagon for additional border wall construction.\n\nThe National Emergencies Act, a post-Watergate legislation, grants the Executive Branch strong powers to rearrange funds if the president declares an emergency is ongoing. In this case, Mr. Trump plans to take more than $6 billion from the Defense Department for wall-building.\n\nSenate Majority Leader McConnell stated, \"I think most of my members now believe this is not a constitutional issue, but rather this grant of authority to any president, not just this one, but any president, was too broad back in the 1970s when it was passed.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer argued that Republicans have long complained about an overbearing Executive Branch. This, he said, is their opportunity to reel it in. \"The vote tomorrow boils down to something very simply for our Republican friends: Do you believe in the Constitution and conservative principles?\" Mr. Schumer said.\n\nHowever, Republicans counter that Democrats are being hypocritical, as they did not object when President Obama claimed executive powers to create the DACA deportation amnesty, and Democrats also voted for border fencing in the past.",
    " Title: Analysis of Vice Presidential Debate: Moderator's Performance Under Scrutiny\n\nArticle:\n\nTuesday's Vice Presidential debate, moderated by CBS News' Elaine Quijano, was met with criticism for its lack of focus and control. The conversation often meandered, with the candidates speaking past each other rather than engaging in substantive discussion.\n\nQuijano, the debate's moderator, faced criticism for her handling of the debate. David Axelrod, CNN senior political commentator, observed on Twitter, \"@Elaine_Quijano seems intent on running through her questions, even when significant exchanges are happening.\"\n\nOne of the most notable instances of this occurred when Quijano switched topics just as Sen. Tim Kaine was pressing Gov. Mike Pence to explain why he had not defended his running mate Donald Trump on six different issues. Jeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic's national correspondent, tweeted shortly after, \"@JeffreyGoldberg ( @JeffreyGoldberg ) October 5, 2016, \"Elaine Quijano should occasionally go where the debate is going, and not stop these interesting arguments.\"\n\nKenneth Li, the managing editor at Newsweek, asked, \"Why change the topic at the best moment?\"\n\nAt other times, Quijano seemed powerless to stop the candidates from bickering with each other. She was even forced to reprimand both candidates at one point, telling them, \"Gentlemen, the people at home can not understand you when you speak over each other.\"\n\nOn at least one occasion, Quijano was similarly powerless in getting the candidates to address her question. \"I'll remind you both, the topic was North Korea,\" she told the candidates as they attacked one another over the Clinton and Trump foundations.\n\nQuijano's performance served as a reminder that debates are not scripted events, and they require moderators who can be fluid and adapt to the direction the candidates choose to take the discussion. With only one vice presidential debate and a tight 90-minute format, Quijano had an extremely challenging task.\n\nMoreover, both candidates were more interested in attacking each other's running mates than answering the questions at hand. They also had two different styles, which made moderation difficult: Kaine was notably aggressive and interrupted Pence frequently, while Pence cast a more thoughtful, reflective posture.\n\nIn conclusion, the Vice Presidential debate moderated by Elaine Quijano was met with criticism for its lack of focus and control. Quijano's performance served as a reminder that debates require moderators who can be flexible and adapt to the candidates' discussions, rather than sticking rigidly to a predetermined script.",
    " Title: Senate Republicans Cede Control to Democrats as Filibuster Standoff Continues\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that signifies the ongoing tension between Senate Republicans and Democrats over filibuster changes on nominations, Senate Republicans are reportedly planning to cede control of the chamber to the Democrats over the weekend. This decision comes as a response to the Republican's ongoing refusal to grant unanimous consent for shortening debate periods and bringing nominations to the floor, a move that has slowed the Senate's schedule.\n\nWith approximately ten nominations remaining for the year, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is aiming to get through four of these before adjourning for the year, with the mid to late weekend as a potential timeline for this departure. This decision comes after a marathon session of work, with Reid and a few others working around the clock for the past couple of days to push through the nominations.\n\nHowever, it appears that many Senate Republicans may not stick around for this weekend's proceedings. Senate GOP Whip John Cornyn (Texas) stated that it is up to individual senators whether they wish to remain in Congress on Friday and Saturday to vote on the nominations that Reid has put on the schedule. Cornyn added that Republican leadership would ensure at least one Republican senator remains on or near the floor to object to Democratic requests to waive various procedural hurdles.\n\nDespite the Republican's actions, it seems that the filibuster changes are working effectively, with nominees being confirmed albeit with some delay. The GOP's actions are being perceived as a tantrum rather than a strategic move, with one GOP senator commenting, \"I'm not sure how many Republicans will stick around. I don't think the Democrats remembered how important it is to get unanimous consent on little things to make this place work.\"\n\nWhile the Republicans' actions may be frustrating for the Democrats, it is their prerogative to prolong the process if they so choose. In fact, it is worth questioning whether the Republicans will return after the weekend, given their current stance. The filibuster changes have taken away the Republicans' ability to block all nominees for no reason, leading to this standoff and the potential for a prolonged absence from the Senate floor.",
    " Title: Supreme Court Upholds Obama's Health Care Reform Law: Political Implications and Reactions\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a historic decision on Thursday, the Supreme Court upheld President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, a legislation that has been a subject of intense debate since its enactment in 2010. Speaking from the East Room of the White House, President Obama hailed the ruling as a victory for the American people, stating that it would secure the lives of millions by virtue of this law.\n\nIn a 5-4 ruling, the high court determined that the individual mandate, which requires individuals to have health insurance, is valid as a tax, despite its constitutional incompatibility under the commerce clause. The President acknowledged the contentious nature of the issue since his presidency, but maintained his advocacy for the law was not driven by political motives.\n\n\"I did not do this because it was good politics,\" Obama said. \"I did it because I believed it was good for the country. I did it because I believed it was good for the American people.\"\n\nThe political implications of the decision are expected to intensify as a significant campaign issue ahead of the November elections. The presumptive GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, has consistently pledged to repeal the law on his first day in office if elected.\n\n\"What the court did not do on its last day in session, I will do on my first day if elected president of the United States, and that is, I will act to repeal Obamacare,\" Romney said in response to the decision.\n\nIn his address, President Obama countered Romney's stance by referencing Romney's own health care law as Massachusetts governor, a measure that Democrats argue served as the model for the federal health care law, given its inclusion of a mandate to buy insurance.\n\n\"Even though I knew it would not be politically popular, and resisted the idea when I ran for this office, we ultimately included a provision in the Affordable Care Act that people who can afford to buy health insurance should take the responsibility to do so,\" Obama said. \"In fact, this idea has enjoyed support from members of both parties, including the current Republican nominee for president.\"\n\nWith the Supreme Court ruling the individual mandate as a tax, political analysts predict that Republicans will argue that Obama's legislation imposes a massive tax on the American public. However, President Obama stated on Thursday that his administration will continue to defend and implement the law.\n\n\"The highest court in the land has now spoken,\" Obama said. \"We will continue to implement this law.\"",
    " Title: Supreme Court Justice Kennedy's Controversial Remarks Spark Debate on DOMA Decision\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a controversial move, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his majority decision to strike down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), was accused by critics of expressing contempt towards those who hold traditional views on marriage. The decision, which redefined marriage as a union between two people, rather than a union between a man and a woman for federal law purposes, was met with strong criticism from Justice Antonin Scalia in his dissent.\n\nKennedy's decision, which was released on Wednesday, was seen as a strong rebuke of the traditional definition of marriage, which had been held by President Barack Obama until the day before. The decision set the stage for the court to enshrine its view of marriage as the law of the land.\n\nIn his decision, Kennedy wrote that DOMA inflicts an \"injury and indignity\" on same-sex couples that denies \"an essential part of the liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment.\" He also stated that the law is motivated by a \"bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group.\"\n\nEd Whelan of the Ethics and Public Policy Center pointed out that the federal government has myriad programs that require a definition of marriage. For example, under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, a person who is legally separated from their spouse but not yet divorced is treated as unmarried, as is a person whose spouse is a nonresident alien.\n\nJustice Scalia, in his dissent, argued that DOMA serves a clear purpose. If a same-sex couple marries in a state where it is recognized and moves to a state where it is not, the federal government should defer to the law of the state where the couple resides. DOMA, according to Scalia, settles this question.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Kennedy's remarks has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that his comments were unnecessary and inflammatory, while others argue that they were a necessary part of the decision to strike down DOMA. The decision has far-reaching implications for same-sex couples and their rights under federal law.",

Akhmetshin, a dual U.S.-Russia citizen, attended the meeting, which was arranged by Donald Trump Jr. and also attended by Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort.\n\nAkhmetshin, who has been described as a known \"IO,\" or intelligence operative, by a U.S. official, told The Associated Press on Friday that he attended the meeting between Trump's son and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a politically connected Russian lawyer. The Trump team believed that Veselnitskaya had damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nU.S. officials became aware of Akhmetshin's potential involvement in the meeting earlier this week. Three officials expressed concern about his role to various media outlets and said they were probing it further as part of their larger investigation into ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin.\n\nAlthough Trump Jr. has acknowledged meeting Veselnitskaya, he did not disclose the attendance of Akhmetshin, a well-known figure in the capital's murky world of foreign influence peddling. The lobbyist's role raises new red flags for U.S. officials as they study whether and how the Kremlin might have sought to exert influence over the 2016 Trump campaign.\n\nAkhmetshin and Veselnitskaya, who is alleged to have indirect ties to the Kremlin, previously worked together in Washington, lobbying against the Magnitsky Act, a bipartisan measure that imposed sanctions on several top Russian officials as punishment for the 2009 death in Moscow of an imprisoned lawyer who had exposed massive financial fraud.\n\nInvestigators are scrambling to understand the full context of the previously undisclosed meeting between Veselnitskaya and Trump associates, which was arranged by a British tabloid reporter named Rob Goldstone. The June meeting at Trump Tower, which Trump officials say was brief and yielded no useful information, was arranged by Goldstone, who now works as an agent representing Emin Agalarov, a Moscow pop star whose father is a real estate mogul close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn an email days before the meeting, Goldstone told Trump that Veselnitskaya had damaging information on Clinton, which Goldstone said was \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\" Trump Jr. replied, \"If it's what you say I love it.\"\n\nAkhmetshin and Veselnitskaya worked together lobbying for a group called The Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative, a D.C.-based nongovernmental association that has lobbied against the Magnitsky Act.\n\nTrump Jr. has said his meeting with Veselnitskaya was dedicated largely to discussion of issues related to that law, which is named for Russian lawyer and whistle-blower Sergei Magnitsky, who died in 2009 after being allegedly tortured in a Russian prison.\n\nThe existence of the controversial June meeting was rumored for months, but neither the Senate Intelligence Committee nor, according to CNN, the FBI - both of whom are probing potential ties between Trump's campaign and the Russian government - knew the details before the Times published its stories.\n\nAkhmetshin - whose lobbying tenure has included several high-profile efforts to promote the Kremlin's agenda in Washington - has run afoul of Congress in recent weeks. In a March letter to the Justice Department, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley accused Akhmetshin of failing to register properly under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\nAccording to a letter obtained by various media outlets, Akhmetshin told the Justice Department's National Security Division in April that he is properly registered and did nothing wrong. \"It is my understanding,\" he adds, \"that Veselnitskaya is not 'an agent of a foreign government or foreign political party.'\"\n\nAkhmetshin told The Associated Press on Friday that he had been drafted into the Soviet Army and served from 1986 to 1988, but denied having any spy training.",
    " Title: President Trump and James Mattis Engage in Public Spat over Criticism and Past Service\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a series of tweets, President Donald Trump responded to criticism from former Defense Secretary James Mattis, labeling him as an \"overrated\" military leader whom he relished firing.\n\n\"Probably the only thing Barack Obama and I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world\u2019s most overrated General,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"I asked for his letter of resignation, & felt great about it.\"\n\nMr. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, criticized the president Wednesday for \"militarizing\" the federal response to nationwide protests over police brutality. He called Mr. Trump \"the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2014 does not even pretend to try.\"\n\nThe president, in his tweets, said of Mr. Mattis, \"His nickname was \u2018Chaos\u2019, which I didn\u2019t like, and changed it to \u2018Mad Dog.\u2019 His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations.\"\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Mr. Mattis was given the nickname \"Mad Dog\" in the military long before Mr. Trump was elected. A San Diego Tribune article in 2013 refers to the nickname, noting that Mr. Mattis didn\u2019t like the moniker.\n\nMr. Trump further stated, \"I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom \u2018brought home the bacon.\u2019 I didn\u2019t like his \u2018leadership\u2019 style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!\"\n\nContrary to popular belief, Mr. Mattis wasn\u2019t fired; he resigned after clashing with the president over the administration\u2019s policy in Syria.\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany also weighed in, stating Mr. Mattis\u2019s statement was \"little more than a self-promotional stunt to appease the DC elite.\"\n\nShe tweeted, \"President Trump is the law and order President that has restored peace to our nation\u2019s streets.\"\n\n\"Mattis\u2019s small words pale in comparison to @POTUS\u2019s strong action,\" she said.",
    " Title: \"The Case for Inclusive Opinion Journalism: A Response to Eric Levitz's Argument for a Broader Perspective in Mainstream Media\"\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a recent article for New York magazine, Eric Levitz has argued that mainstream publications, in response to the controversy surrounding the hiring and firing of conservative journalist Kevin Williamson, should lean further to the left and exclude conservative viewpoints. This argument, however, raises questions about the role of ideological diversity in journalism and the potential consequences of such a shift.\n\nLevitz's argument is based on a discussion between Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg and writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, the transcript of which was leaked to The Huffington Post. Goldberg expressed a desire for intellectual diversity at The Atlantic, but Coates argued that the publication could still have intellectual diversity without conservative opinions, as long as it shifted the goalpost in the other direction.\n\nLevitz agrees with Coates, stating that most conservative opinion writers are irrelevant to the conservative movement and that conservative arguments are wrong and not worth debating. He argues that socialist arguments, on the other hand, have yet to be debunked and should be given more space in mainstream publications.\n\nLevitz's argument, however, is met with counterpoints. One such counterpoint is that excluding conservative viewpoints from mainstream publications could exacerbate polarization in American discourse. The further left that opinion pages move, the easier it is for President Trump to rally his base around the idea that the media hates them. If one believes that Trump voters are too reliant on Fox News, talk radio, and explicit conspiracy sites, exacerbating this problem by widening the range of permissible views on the left while banishing conventional, widely held conservative opinions seems counterproductive.\n\nAnother counterpoint is that extreme or unpopular arguments may contain kernels of truth or contribute something to the public's awareness that the conventional, moderate liberal punditocracy would have missed. For instance, the entire liberal press seemed assured of Hillary Clinton's victory in the 2016 election. Had they listened more closely to the far-left grievances of the Bernie Sanders wing, they might have been better prepared for the actual outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over the role of ideological diversity in opinion journalism is complex and multifaceted. While it is important to challenge biases and strive for a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of issues, excluding certain viewpoints from mainstream publications could have unintended consequences. It is crucial for good writers and editors to approach this challenge with an open mind, recognizing that all perspectives, even extreme or unpopular ones, may contain valuable insights. As New York Times columnist Ross Douthat wrote in response to Levitz, \"These arguments are not shaping Trumpian policymaking because nothing is likely to shape Trumpian policymaking. But it is very likely that they'll shape future formations of right-wing and centrist policy, and have influence on the liberal-left debate.\"",
    " Title: Ottawa Shooting Suspect's Actions Linked to Radicalization, Authorities Confirm\n\nIn a series of events that have shaken the nation, the Ottawa shooter, identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was killed in a gun battle with authorities following a violent incident at Canada's Parliament complex. The mother of the 32-year-old suspect, Susan Bibeau, expressed her condolences to the family of the victim, stating that they had not seen their son for five years before meeting him for lunch last week.\n\nIn a statement to The Associated Press, Susan Bibeau wrote, \"We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I do not understand, and part of me wants to hate him at this time.\" She described her son as \"lost and did not fit in.\"\n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson, during a briefing with reporters, confirmed that while the full extent of Bibeau's motivation remains unclear, his actions were \"linked to his radicalization.\"\n\nAuthorities have found no evidence linking Bibeau to Martin Rouleau-Couture, the newly radicalized man who ran over two Canadian soldiers on Monday. Bibeau was not on the list of 90 or so Canadians that authorities are monitoring for national security reasons. However, Bibeau's email address was found on the computer of a man who was arrested on a terrorism charge.\n\nPolice learned through their conversation with Bibeau's mother that he had intentions to travel to Syria. He had applied for a passport, and authorities were in the midst of investigating his application. Bibeau was a Canadian citizen and may have also held Libyan citizenship.\n\nNPR's Jackie Northam reports that Zehaf-Bibeau was a fairly recent convert to Islam who had a criminal record in multiple provinces. The Globe and Mail describes him as \"a labourer and small-time criminal \u2014 a man who had had a religious awakening and seemed to have become mentally unstable.\"\n\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reports that Zehaf-Bibeau was charged in 2004 with drug possession, pleaded guilty, and served 60 days in jail. He was in trouble with the law again in 2011, this time in British Columbia, where he was charged with robbery and uttering threats. He was found guilty of the lesser charge and sentenced to one day in jail, with credit for 66 days already served.\n\nThe Canadian authorities are still investigating the possibility of a second shooter and whether the incidents are connected. This comes at a critical time for Canada, as the nation is preparing to help in the fight against the so-called Islamic State and is providing men and support for that effort.",
    " Title: Homeland Security Secretary Disputes Claims of ISIS Fighters Crossing U.S. Border by Rep. Duncan Hunter\n\nArticle:\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has refuted claims made by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) that ISIS fighters have crossed the United States' southern border into Texas. During an interview on CNN's \"Situation Room,\" Johnson stated, \"Let's not unduly create fear and anxiety in the public by passing on speculation and rumor.\"\n\nHunter, in an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday night, asserted that he had learned from Border Patrol officers that at least 10 ISIS fighters had been caught trying to cross the Mexican border, with the possibility of \"dozens more\" evading capture.\n\nJohnson, however, dismissed these claims as unsupported by \"credible, specific intelligence to that effect.\" He emphasized the importance of responsible information sharing, stating, \"We should be responsible in what we decide to share with the American public, so that the public is informed.\"\n\nHis comments followed a statement from a Homeland Security spokeswoman, who labeled Hunter's statement as \"categorically false.\"\n\nIn response to Johnson's remarks, Hunter's spokesman, Joe Kasper, maintained the congressman's stance. Kasper said, \"The congressman was conveying what he knows\u2014and what he was told.\" He added, \"A high level source informed the congressman\u2014it was also said that DHS is actively discouraging any talk of IS on the border.\"\n\nJohnson, in his interview, reiterated that there is no specific intelligence indicating ISIS is planning to infiltrate the U.S. through the southern border. He used the acronym ISIL, another term for ISIS, to emphasize this point.\n\nThe ongoing debate between Hunter and the Homeland Security Department highlights the ongoing concern over national security and border control in the United States.",
    " Title: Clinton Foundation to Continue Accepting Foreign Donations During Hillary Clinton's Presidential Campaign\n\nArticle:\n\nIn a move that has sparked controversy and raised questions about potential conflicts of interest, the Clinton Foundation has announced it will continue to accept donations from foreign governments as Hillary Clinton runs for president. The decision, outlined in a policy summary to be released Thursday, permits donations from six countries: Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation, which has received over $100 million in foreign government donations, will limit donations to these six countries. Other nations will be prohibited from making large donations to the foundation. However, these prohibited governments will be allowed to participate in the Clinton Global Initiative, a subsidiary of the foundation where companies, nonprofit groups, and government officials work on solutions to global problems.\n\nThe decision has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, particularly in light of Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. During her time in office, Clinton used a personal email account on an unsecured server for all of her official State Department business, a move that has been criticized for evading congressional oversight and potentially compromising national security.\n\nFurthermore, despite her reputation as an advocate for women's rights, Clinton has accepted millions in donations from countries with questionable records on women's rights, such as Saudi Arabia. This has led some to question her commitment to promoting women's rights globally.\n\nAs the 2020 presidential race heats up, the decision to continue accepting foreign donations raises questions about Hillary Clinton's ability to put the best interests of the United States first if elected president. The controversy surrounding her email scandal and her acceptance of donations from countries with poor human rights records has led some to question her integrity and commitment to the nation's security and values."
